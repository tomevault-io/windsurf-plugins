description: `zot-cli` is a Python `click` command-line wrapper for `pyzotero`. As much as possible, we directly pass through inputs, outputs, and exceptions. The goal is simply to expose the `pyzotero` API from the command line so that it can be more effectively used by AI agents with a Bash runner tool. Since the primary users will be AI agents, we generally want to format outputs as valid JSON unless a user specifically requests yaml or tabulated output via an option flag.

`zot-cli` is a Python `click` command-line wrapper for `pyzotero`. As much as possible, we directly pass through inputs, outputs, and exceptions. The goal is simply to expose the `pyzotero` API from the command line so that it can be more effectively used by AI agents with a Bash runner tool. Since the primary users will be AI agents, we generally want to format outputs as valid JSON unless a user specifically requests yaml or tabulated output via an option flag.

## How `pyzotero` works

.. important::
    A ``Zotero`` instance is bound to the library or group used to create it. Thus, if you create a ``Zotero`` instance with a ``library_id`` of ``67`` and a ``library_type`` of ``group``, its item methods will only operate upon that group. Similarly, if you create a ``Zotero`` instance with your own ``library_id`` and a ``library_type`` of ``user``, the instance will be bound to your Zotero library.

First, create a new Zotero instance:

    .. py:class:: Zotero(library_id, library_type[, api_key, preserve_json_order, locale, local])

        :param str library_id: a valid Zotero API user ID
        :param str library_type: a valid Zotero API library type: **user** or **group**
        :param str api_key: a valid Zotero API user key
        :param bool preserve_json_order: Load JSON returns with OrderedDict to preserve their order
        :param str locale: Set the `locale <https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/types_and_fields#zotero_web_api_item_typefield_requests>`_, allowing retrieval of localised item types, field types, and creator types. Defaults to "en-US".
        :param str local: use the local Zotero http server instead of the remote API. Note that the local server currently (November 2024) only allows **read** requests

Example:

    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 4

        from pyzotero import zotero
        zot = zotero.Zotero('123', 'user', 'ABC1234XYZ')
        # we now have a Zotero object, zot, and access to all its methods
        first_ten = zot.items(limit=10)
        # a list containing dicts of the ten most recently modified library items
