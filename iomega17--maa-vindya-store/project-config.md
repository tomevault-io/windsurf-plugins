## Workspace Checklist
- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created (file seeded during workspace setup).
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (captured SRS with storefront/admin scope, Razorpay, Node/Next preferences).
- [x] Scaffold the Project (create-next-app with TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind via temp dir to retain .github artifacts).
- [x] Customize the Project (storefront + admin per SRS, Razorpay simulator, cart context, OTP flow, Tailwind theme).
- [x] Install Required Extensions (no additional VS Code extensions required per setup info).
- [x] Compile the Project (npm run lint && npm run test executed successfully).
- [x] Create and Run Task (workspace task created for npm run dev to satisfy run requirement).
- [x] Launch the Project (dev server started via npm run dev, available on localhost:3000 and network address).
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README verified, this file updated, HTML comments removed).

### Execution Guidelines
- Track progress with the manage_todo_list tool and update after completing each major step.
- Keep communication concise, avoid dumping full command outputs, and mention if a step is intentionally skipped.
- Use '.' as the working directory for commands; avoid creating extra folders unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer existing tooling (lint, test, tasks) and only install extensions specified by project setup guidance.
- Generate purposeful features aligned with user requirements; call out placeholders that need replacement.
- Consider the project complete when scaffolding, customization, diagnostics, documentation, and launch instructions are all delivered.
