# MigrationOps

SQL Server schema versioning tool. Migrations are plain .sql files executed in
filename order by the ConsoleApp. Solution has three projects:
`MigrationOps.ConsoleApp` (runner), `MigrationOps.Core` (framework), and
`MigrationOps.Dashboard` (Razor Pages web UI over the same Core logic;
read-only except the dry-run action, which executes pending scripts in
a rolled-back transaction, and the Run Migrations action, which actually
applies them).

## Core layout

`MigrationOps.Core/MigrationFramework/` is split by responsibility — there is no
god class, and each piece is constructible on its own:

- `Configuration/` — `IMigrationConfig` / `MigrationConfig`: dbconfig.json
  layering (base → `.local` overlay → environment variables), connection
  strings, folder settings, alert settings.
- `Scripts/` — `ScriptParser` (checksum, CREATE OR ALTER validation,
  edited-migration detection), `SqlBatchSplitter` (`GO` batch separators) and
  `ScriptCatalog` (which .sql files run, in what order, and which
  per-database subfolders exist). Pure; no database, no configuration.
- `Data/` — `IHistoryStore` / `SqlHistoryStore`: reads and writes of
  `__MigrationHistory` / `__ScriptHistory` outside any apply transaction.
- `Execution/` — `IScriptExecutionGateway` / `SqlScriptExecutionGateway`: the
  only place that opens connections and transactions. Apply runs a script and
  its history row in one transaction; `IVerifySession` is the verify
  counterpart, and disposing it always rolls back. Both paths send SQL through
  the same `ExecuteBatches` helper, so `GO` splitting is identical for apply
  and verify.
- `Services/` — orchestration with no ADO.NET of its own: `ScriptApplier`
  (apply pipeline), `PlanBuilder` (plan building/classification),
  `PlanDryRunner` (`dry-run`).
- `MigrationOpsServices` — composition root; `CreateDefault(path?)` wires the
  SQL Server implementations. Tests substitute fakes for the interfaces above
  instead of needing a live server.

## Build and run

Requires the .NET 8 SDK.

- Build (repo root): `dotnet build MigrationOps.sln`
- Run: `cd MigrationOps.ConsoleApp && dotnet run`

Console app CLI:

- `dotnet run -- apply [--db <name>]` — apply object scripts + migrations
  (optionally to one configured database only).
- `dotnet run -- validate [--db <name>]` — read-only preview: per file,
  reports already applied / would apply / CHANGED (edited applied migration) /
  validation errors, never halting early. Exit code 0 only with no CHANGED or
  validation-error entries.
- `dotnet run -- dry-run [--db <name>]` — same report as `validate`, plus
  executes the pending scripts in one transaction per database and always
  rolls back. Exit code 0 only with no CHANGED, validation-error, or
  dry-run-failed entries.
- No args: interactive menu (choose action + target DB). If stdin is
  redirected (CI), it performs a full apply exactly like the old behavior.

Always run from `MigrationOps.ConsoleApp/`. `Configurations/dbconfig.json` and
the `Migrations` folder are resolved relative to the working directory, so
`dotnet run --project` from the repo root silently loads no configuration.

- Dashboard: `cd MigrationOps.Dashboard && dotnet run` (listens on
  `http://localhost:5280`). Also working-directory-sensitive: its
  `appsettings.json` points at the ConsoleApp's `dbconfig.json` and
  `Migrations` folder via relative paths. Requires a pre-created dashboard
  database (`DashboardStore:ConnectionString`) for login accounts; the app
  creates its `__DashboardUsers` table but never the database itself. First
  account is bootstrapped at `/Register`, which closes once any user exists.
  `/Validate` is the web equivalent of the console `validate`/`dry-run`/`apply`
  commands (same `BuildPlan`/`RunDryRun`/`ScriptApplier` Core calls) — its
  "Run validate" button matches console `validate`, its "Run dry-run" button
  matches console `dry-run`, and its "Run Migrations" button matches console
  `apply` (the one action on this page that writes real, permanent changes);
  the object-scripts root defaults to the `Scripts` folder next to
  `MigrationsRoot`, overridable via a `ScriptsRoot` setting in
  `appsettings.json`.

## Migration files

- Live in `MigrationOps.ConsoleApp/Migrations/<Database>/`, named
  `yyyyMMdd-NNN-Description.sql` (e.g.
  `Migrations/Db1/20240807-001-CreateUserTable.sql`). `NNN` is a zero-padded
  per-day sequence starting at 001, scoped to that database's own subfolder;
  `Description` is PascalCase, no spaces.
- A file's database is its subfolder, not a comment: `<Database>` must exactly
  match a key under `Databases` in `Configurations/dbconfig.json` (case
  matters — folder lookups are case-sensitive on Linux even though this repo
  runs on Windows today, e.g. `Db1`, `Db2`). A subfolder under `Migrations/`
  or `Scripts/` that doesn't match any configured database is reported as a
  validation error by `validate`/`dry-run` and makes `apply` throw and halt
  the run, rather than silently never being discovered.
- `GO` batch separators are supported. A line whose only content is `GO`
  (optionally `GO <count>`, optionally with a trailing `--` comment) ends the
  batch; the runner sends each batch as its own SqlCommand, in order, inside
