description: Use only when the user explicitly asks to use Cockpit or work on Cockpit itself.

This rule is opt-in. Do not load it for generic Flutter, UI, debugging,
screenshots, mobile, desktop, browser, or E2E work. Load the `cockpit` skill from
`.cursor/skills/cockpit` before controlling an application or
claiming runtime validation. If skill discovery is unavailable, read the
self-contained `.cursor/skills/cockpit/SKILL.md` directly.

Use the authenticated Supervisor and resolve explicit identities:

```bash
cockpit daemon status
cockpit target discover
cockpit target inspect --target-id <targetId> --profile minimal
cockpit operation list --workspace-id <workspaceId>
```

Use a validated `cockpit.test/v2` case or suite for reusable E2E. Prefer
`.cursor/mcp.json` when MCP is available. Judge success from terminal run
state, assertions, structured errors, and report-backed evidence.
