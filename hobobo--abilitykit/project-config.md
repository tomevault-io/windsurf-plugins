# Build Verification Rule

## Important

**After writing any new code or making changes to C# files, always run `dotnet build` to verify compilation.** This ensures all code compiles correctly before considering the task complete.

## Workflow

1. Write or modify C# code
2. Immediately run `dotnet build` to check for compilation errors
3. If errors occur:
   - Read the error messages carefully
   - Fix all compilation errors
   - Re-run `dotnet build` to verify fixes
4. Only mark task as complete when `dotnet build` succeeds with no errors

## Why This Matters

- Catches type mismatches early
- Prevents API breakage from spreading
- Ensures refactoring changes are consistent across the codebase
- Maintains code quality and integration health

## Examples

### Good: Always verify after writing code

```bash
# After creating a new file
Write: "Unity/Packages/example/MyClass.cs"
# Immediately run build
dotnet build Unity/Packages/example/example.csproj
# Fix any errors if they appear
```

### Bad: Skip verification

```bash
# Writing code but not verifying
Write: "Unity/Packages/example/MyClass.cs"
# User later finds compilation errors
```

## Summary

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Write/modify C# code |
| 2 | Run `dotnet build` |
| 3 | Fix any errors found |
| 4 | Repeat until build succeeds |
| 5 | Task complete |
