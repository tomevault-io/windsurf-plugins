A production-ready full-stack React application template with integrated React Router 6 SPA mode, TypeScript, Vitest, Zod and modern tooling.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + React Router 6 (spa) + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS 3
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **UI**: Radix UI + TailwindCSS 3 + Lucide React icons

## Project Structure

```
client/                   # React SPA frontend
├── pages/                # Route components (Index.tsx = home)
├── components/ui/        # Pre-built UI component library
├── App.tsx                # App entry point and with SPA routing setup
└── global.css            # TailwindCSS 3 theming and global styles
```

## Key Features

## SPA Routing System

The routing system is powered by React Router 6:

- `client/pages/Index.tsx` represents the home page.
- Routes are defined in `client/App.tsx` using the `react-router-dom` import
- Route files are located in the `client/pages/` directory

For example, routes can be defined with:

```typescript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  {/* ADD ALL CUSTOM ROUTES ABOVE THE CATCH-ALL "*" ROUTE */}
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>;
```

### Styling System

- **Primary**: TailwindCSS 3 utility classes
- **Theme and design tokens**: Configure in `client/global.css`
- **UI components**: Pre-built library in `client/components/ui/`
- **Utility**: `cn()` function combines `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes

```typescript
// cn utility usage
className={cn(
  "base-classes",
  { "conditional-class": condition },
  props.className  // User overrides
)}
```

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm run dev        # Start dev server
pnpm run build      # Production build
pnpm run typecheck  # TypeScript validation
pnpm test          # Run Vitest tests
```

## Adding Features

### Add new colors to the theme

Open `client/global.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` and add new tailwind colors.

### New Page Route

1. Create component in `client/pages/MyPage.tsx`
2. Add route in `client/App.tsx`:

```typescript
<Route path="/my-page" element={<MyPage />} />
```

## Production Deployment

- **Standard**: `pnpm run build`

## Architecture Notes

- Single-port development with Vite
- TypeScript throughout
- Full hot reload for rapid development
- Comprehensive UI component library included
