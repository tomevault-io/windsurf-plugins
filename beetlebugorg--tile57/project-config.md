# tile57 — engine conventions

## The API style

The public surface (include/tile57.h, src/tile57.zig, bindings/go) follows one
style. Hold every new or renamed symbol against it.

**The pipeline is the organizing principle.** Everything is bake, then compose
(or bake, then render): source charts bake once to per-chart archives; every
output is produced from baked archives. Sections, in order: Version, Errors,
Bake, Render (the chart), Compose, Style, Util. The header, the Zig public
root, and the docs all follow that same section order.

**The unit is a chart, never "cell" in prose.** An ENC cell IS one chart at one
compilation scale. "Cell" survives only as spec-facing vocabulary: one
first-use definition ("a *cell*, in the spec's vocabulary"), the `cell` tile
property and other wire-format names, `<cell.000>` CLI placeholders and the
`cell`/`cells` CLI commands, and the s57/geometry module internals (the domain
that parses cells).

**Everything is in a family, and the family token always leads.** The prefix
names what a call runs against; never bury the family token mid-name.

1. *Handles namespace under their noun and mirror each other.* `tile57_chart`
   (one open baked archive) and `tile57_compose` (the runtime compositor) are
   peers: `tile57_chart_open` / `_close` / `_get_info` / `_tile` / `_png` /
   `_query` ↔ `tile57_compose_open` / `_close` / `_get_meta` / `_tile` /
   `_png` / `_query`. A noun prefix means the first parameter is that handle —
   the C spelling of a method.
2. *Handle-free families lead with their section token, then what the call
   acts on or yields* — the token's part of speech follows the section, so the
   name reads naturally after it. `tile57_bake_*` is a verb family
   (`bake_chart_bytes`, `bake_tree` — "bake the X"); `tile57_enc_*` is a domain
   family (the raw S-57 source readers — ENC is the ONE vocabulary for raw
   source data, never s57_/source_/scan_ variants); `tile57_style_*` is a
   product family (`style_build` / `style_diff` / `style_template`, never
   `build_style` — "the style's build/diff/template"). Small POD/domain noun
   families follow the same shape: `pmtiles_metadata`, `status_str`,
   `mariner_defaults`, `colortables_default`, `assets_free`.
3. *Bare `tile57_` is the library itself* — process/library-level plumbing
   only: `tile57_version`, `tile57_free`, `tile57_warmup`. No handle method is
   ever bare.

In Zig the namespace is the family, with the same two consequences: a member
never repeats its namespace (`ComposeSource.openFiles`, never
`compose.openComposeSourceFiles`; `compose.tile`, never `compose.composeTile`),
and the two handles mirror (`Chart.openPmtilesPath` ↔ `ComposeSource.open` /
`.openFiles`).

**Outputs are named by what you get, never by how it's produced or served.**
`tile`, `png`, `pdf`, `canvas`, `surface`, `query` — not serve/render/build/
generate. The chart and the compositor offer the SAME output set, so the names
mirror exactly: `tile57_chart_png` ↔ `tile57_compose_png`, `tile57_chart_tile`
↔ `tile57_compose_tile`, and so on. The compositor is "many charts in, one
chart out"; keep that symmetry when adding an output — it goes on both handles
or has a stated reason not to.

**The status model is universal.** Every call that can fail returns
`tile57_status` (never a bare int, count, or bool) and takes an optional
caller-owned `tile57_error*` as its LAST parameter. Out-parameters come after
inputs and are ALWAYS defined on return — the result on TILE57_OK, NULL/0
otherwise. "Nothing produced" is NOT a failure: OK with a NULL/zero out. Every
pointer argument is BADARG-checked (no NULL derefs across the ABI). Counts and
flags come back through optional out-pointers (NULL to ignore), not return
values. Say "call that can fail" in docs, not "fallible".

**Memory has one rule.** Calls that return bytes allocate `*out`; the caller
releases with `tile57_free(ptr)` — buffers are length-prefixed at allocation,
so the pointer is all it needs. POD across the seam: no Zig errors, slices, or
optionals cross the ABI.

**Ownership and borrowing are explicit.** The compositor BORROWS its charts
(charts outlive it; close the compositor first). A path-opened chart mmaps its
file (the file stays in place). No handle is internally synchronized; document
lifetime + threading on every handle-producing call.

**The Zig public root is curated, not a module mirror.** src/tile57.zig shapes
the public namespace by the API sections; when module layering puts an
implementation elsewhere (e.g. composed view renders live beside Chart because
the `compose` module is a dependency leaf without the render path), the root
still surfaces it under the name it belongs to (`tile57.compose.renderView`).
Public surface trumps internal layering.

**Go bindings track shape, not spelling.** Idiomatic Go names over the same
structure: `Open`/`OpenBytes` on the archive, package-level `Charts`/`Features`/
`FeaturesBytes`/`CatalogEntries` for the enc readers, `ComposeSource.Tile`
mirroring `tile57_compose_tile`, errors as wrapped sentinels
(`errors.Is(err, tile57.ErrParse)`).

## Other repo rules

- Never reference specs/*.md in code comments (specs/ is never committed);
  describe designs inline.
