description: Project-wide coding standards and conventions for Masumi Registry Service
---


You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and building type-safe REST APIs with Zod validation for a Cardano blockchain registry service.

Key Principles

- Write strict TypeScript with ES Modules using import/export syntax; the project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json.
- Export singleton objects for services and repositories, not classes; follow the pattern of exporting a const object with named functions.
- Follow layered architecture with Routes handling HTTP concerns, Services containing business logic, and Repositories handling data access.
- Use Zod for all runtime validation combined with TypeScript for static types.

Import Conventions

- Import Zod from `@/utils/zod-openapi`, never from 'zod' directly; this version includes OpenAPI extensions.
- Import Prisma client from `@/utils/db` as the singleton instance.
- Import logger from `@/utils/logger` for all logging; never use console.log.
- Import configuration from `@/utils/config` for environment variables and defaults.
- Use path aliases for all imports: `@/routes/*`, `@/services/*`, `@/repositories/*`, `@/utils/*`; avoid relative paths.

Code Organization

- Routes should only handle HTTP concerns and input/output validation; delegate all logic to services.
- Services contain business logic and orchestrate repository calls; they should be framework-agnostic with no Express types.
- Repositories are pure Prisma queries returning database types; keep them focused on data access only.
- Each module should have an index.ts that exports its public API.
- Separate complex Zod schemas into dedicated schemas.ts files within route directories.

TypeScript Guidelines

- Enable and respect strict mode; never use `any` type without explicit justification in comments.
- Use `z.infer<typeof schema>` for type inference from Zod schemas instead of manual type definitions.
- Use `z.nativeEnum()` for Prisma enum types to ensure type safety.
- Prefer explicit return types on all exported functions for better documentation and error detection.
- Use descriptive names for functions and variables that explain their purpose.

Error Handling

- Use http-errors package with createHttpError for all HTTP error responses.
- Log errors with context using Winston structured logging via the logger utility.
- Use Promise.allSettled for parallel operations where individual failures should not stop others.
- Always clean up resources like AbortControllers and timeouts in finally blocks.

Formatting Standards

- Use single quotes for strings, semicolons are required.
- Use 2-space indentation with 80 character maximum line width.
- Use ES5 trailing commas in multiline arrays and objects.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing any changes.

Git Workflow

- Never push directly to main or dev branches; always create pull requests.
- Use conventional commits with format: type(scope): subject.
- Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, revert, build.
- Maximum header length is 72 characters with lowercase type and no period at end.

Dependencies

- express-zod-api for type-safe API endpoints with automatic validation
- zod for schema validation and type inference
- @prisma/client for database ORM
- winston for structured logging
- http-errors for HTTP error responses
