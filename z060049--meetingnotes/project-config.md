# Visible Build Artifacts

- Put distributable artifacts such as `MeetingNotes.app` and `.dmg` files in the visible `build/` directory.
- Use `.build/` only for Swift Package Manager caches and temporary staging.
- Update build scripts and documentation to reference `build/` for artifacts users open, test, or distribute.
