# Resume from saved progress (schedule "main content" track)

- **Where progress is saved**:
  - `ProgressTracker` runs every 1s while `PlayStatus.Playing`.
  - For **non-music schedule content** (`TrackMetadata.IsBibleContent == true`, i.e. `PlayType == Bible`) it updates `TrackMetadata.FinishedDuration` from `IAudioPlayer.CurrentPosition` and calls `IPlaylistService.MarkTrackAsPlayed(...)` to persist into the Schedule DB.
  - For **music injection** (`IsBibleContent == false`, `PlayType == Music`) it does not "resume"; it marks music as finished on the first progress update.

- **When resume is allowed**:
  - `IPlaylistService.ShouldResumeFromLastPositionAsync(scheduleId)` returns `!AlarmSchedule.AlwaysPlayFromStart`.
  - `TrackPlaybackHandler` only seeks when:
    - `startFromBeginning == false`
    - `PlayType == Bible` (this is "schedule main content", not "Bible category")
    - `FinishedDuration != TimeSpan.Zero`
    - schedule allows resume (`AlwaysPlayFromStart == false`)
  - Only the **first** main-content `PlayItem` gets a non-zero `FinishedDuration` seeded into its metadata when building the playlist (from `BiblePublicationSchedule.FinishedDuration`), so "resume" applies to that first main-content track (not the injected music track).
  - **DB fallback** (`GetScheduleFinishedDurationAsync`): when in-memory `FinishedDuration` is zero, `TrackPlaybackHandler` may read from DB as a process-restart safety net. This fallback **only applies when no Bible tracks have been played yet** in the current session (`playedBibleTrackKeys.Count == 0`). Once any Bible track has played, the DB's `FinishedDuration` reflects that track's position and is stale for subsequent tracks — using it would seek a new track to the previous track's position.

- **How seek is applied**:
  - non-iOS/Android (e.g. Windows): seek **before** `PlayAsync`
  - iOS/Android: seek **after** `PlayAsync` using retry logic (`SeekWithRetryAsync`) because seekable ranges may not be ready immediately. To avoid audible audio from the beginning before the seek completes, playback is **muted** before `PlayAsync`, then **unmuted** after the seek finishes (or if seek is skipped, e.g. validation).

- **Navigation overrides**:
  - manual **Previous**: always `startFromBeginning=true`
  - manual **Next**: `startFromBeginning=true` only when that track index was already manually visited this session
  - auto-advance uses `startFromBeginning=false`, but `MarkTrackAsFinished(...)` advances the schedule to the next Bible track and resets progress so resume won't re-seek into a finished track

- **Do not break**:
  - UI-only progress resets (e.g., slider jumping to 0 on next/prev) must not alter `startFromBeginning` decisions or the persisted `FinishedDuration` pipeline.
