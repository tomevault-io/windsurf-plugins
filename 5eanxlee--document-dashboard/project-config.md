# DocDash Agent Surface

For DocDash registry or document-management work, load `.agents/skills/docdash/SKILL.md`.

- Prefer the project-scoped `docdash` MCP server from `.mcp.json`.
- Fall back to `npm run docdash ...` from the repo root when MCP is unavailable.
- For global Codex availability outside this repo, run `npm run codex:install` once from the cloned DocDash repository.
- Do not edit `.docdash/registry.json` by hand; use DocDash interfaces instead.
