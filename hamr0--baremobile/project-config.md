# Aurora Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/.aurora/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like plan, create, implement)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, or architecture shifts
- Sounds ambiguous and you need authoritative guidance before coding

Use `@/.aurora/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and work with plans
- Aurora workflow and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

## MCP Tools Available

Aurora provides MCP tools for code intelligence (automatically available in Claude):

**`lsp`** - LSP code intelligence with 3 actions:
- `deadcode` - Find unused symbols, generates CODE_QUALITY_REPORT.md
- `impact` - Analyze symbol usage, show callers and risk level
- `check` - Quick usage check before editing

**`mem_search`** - Search indexed code with LSP enrichment:
- Returns code snippets with metadata (type, symbol, lines)
- Enriched with LSP context (used_by, called_by, calling)
- Includes git info (last_modified, last_author)

**When to use:**
- Before edits: Use `lsp check` to see usage impact
- Before refactoring: Use `lsp deadcode` or `lsp impact` to find all references
- Code search: Use `mem_search` instead of grep for semantic results
- After large changes: Use `lsp deadcode` to find orphaned code

Keep this managed block so 'aur init --config' can refresh the instructions.

## Dev Rules

**POC first.** Always validate logic with a ~15min proof-of-concept before building. Cover happy path + common edges. POC works → design properly → build with tests. Never ship the POC.

**Build incrementally.** Break work into small independent modules. One piece at a time, each must work on its own before integrating.

**Dependency hierarchy — follow strictly:** vanilla language → standard library → external (only when stdlib can't do it in <100 lines). External deps must be maintained, lightweight, and widely adopted. Exception: always use vetted libraries for security-critical code (crypto, auth, sanitization).

**Lightweight over complex.** Fewer moving parts, fewer deps, less config. Simple > clever. Readable > elegant.

**Open-source only.** No vendor lock-in. Every line of code must have a purpose — no speculative code, no premature abstractions.

## Project Specifics

- **What:** Vanilla JS library — ADB-direct Android device control for autonomous agents. Accessibility tree in, pruned snapshot out.
- **Language:** Vanilla JavaScript, ES modules, no build step
- **Runtime:** Node.js >= 22
- **Protocol:** ADB (Android Debug Bridge) via `child_process.execFile` — no Appium
- **Device:** Any ADB-connected Android device or emulator
- **Modules:** 8 files in `src/`, zero required deps
- **Tests:** 94 passing — run with `node --test test/unit/*.test.js test/integration/*.test.js`
- **Docs:** `docs/README.md` (navigation guide to all documentation)
