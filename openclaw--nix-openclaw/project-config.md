Single source of truth for product direction: `README.md`.

Documentation policy:
- Keep the surface area small.
- Avoid duplicate “pointer‑only” files.
- Update `README.md` first, then adjust references.

Defaults:
- Nix‑first, no sudo.
- Declarative config only.
- Batteries‑included install is the baseline.
- Breaking changes are acceptable pre‑1.0.0 (move fast, keep docs accurate).
- No deprecations; use breaking changes.
- NO INLINE SCRIPTS EVER.
- NEVER send any message (iMessage, email, SMS, etc.) without explicit user confirmation:
  - Always show the full message text and ask: “I’m going to send this: <message>. Send? (y/n)”

OpenClaw packaging:
- The gateway package must include Control UI assets (run `pnpm ui:build` in the Nix build).

Golden path for pins (yolo + manual bumps):
- Hourly GitHub Action **Yolo Update Pins** selects the newest stable upstream OpenClaw release, validates it on the same Linux + macOS contract as `CI`, and only then promotes it.
- If the newest stable release is missing the required public macOS zip asset, yolo fails red and leaves the current pin untouched.
- `scripts/update-pins.sh` is the updater boundary:
  - `select` picks the newest stable release, resolves the source pin from that release tag ref, and emits the exact app asset URL
  - `apply <tag> <sha> <app-url>` materializes the source pin, app pin, `pnpmDepsHash`, and generated config options for that exact release
- Manual bump (rare): trigger yolo manually with `gh workflow run "Yolo Update Pins"`.
- To verify freshness: `git pull --ff-only`, compare `nix/packages/openclaw-app.nix` to `gh release view --repo openclaw/openclaw --json tagName`, and compare `nix/sources/openclaw-source.nix` to `git ls-remote https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git "refs/tags/<tag>" "refs/tags/<tag>^{}"`.
- Recovery note: repin to the latest stable OpenClaw release first, fix Nix-owned seams before touching gateway behavior, and avoid broad `gateway-postpatch.sh` behavior hacks.

CI polling (hard rule):
- Never say "I'll keep polling" unless you are **already** running a blocking loop.
- If you must report status, confirm the loop is active (`tmux ls` / session name).
- Use a blocking bash loop in tmux (preferred) or a sub-agent; do not fake it.
- Example: `tmux new -s nix-openclaw-ci '/tmp/poll-nix-openclaw-ci.sh'`.

Philosophy:

The Zen of ~~Python~~ OpenClaw, ~~by~~ shamelessly stolen from Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
Simple is better than complex.  
Complex is better than complicated.  
Flat is better than nested.  
Sparse is better than dense.  
Readability counts.  
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
Although practicality beats purity.  
Errors should never pass silently.  
Unless explicitly silenced.  
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
Now is better than never.  
Although never is often better than *right* now.  
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Nix file policy:
- No inline file contents in Nix code, ever.
- Always reference explicit file paths (keep docs as real files in the repo).
- No inline scripts in Nix code, ever (use repo scripts and reference their paths).
- No files longer than 400 LOC without user alignment; refactor as you go.
