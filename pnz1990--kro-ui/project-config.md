# kro-ui — AI Agent Context

## What This Is

A standalone read-only web dashboard for [kro](https://kro.run)
(`kubernetes-sigs/kro`). Cluster-first, connects via kubeconfig.
Out-of-tree, out for donation to kro org when stable.

**Stack**: Go 1.25 backend (chi, zerolog, client-go dynamic client) +
React 19 / Vite / TypeScript frontend, embedded via `go:embed`. Single binary.
Port 40107 (D=4, A=01, G=07 → DAG).

---

## Development workflow

This project uses **spec-driven development** with spec-kit.

### PR workflow (required)

All changes go through PRs. Direct push to `main` is blocked.

1. Work on a spec branch in its worktree (see Worktrunk below)
2. Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
3. Open a PR: `gh pr create --base main --head <branch>`
4. CI must pass (see CI pipeline below)
5. 1 approving review required (CODEOWNERS auto-assigns @pnz1990)
6. Squash merge only (configured at repo level)
7. Branch is auto-deleted on merge

### Worktrunk (required workflow)

Each spec gets its own **worktree** (not just a branch). Never use
`git checkout -b` directly — always use worktrunk:

```bash
wt switch --create 001-server-core    # creates worktree + branch + runs hooks
wt list                               # shows all worktrees and their paths
wt switch 001-server-core             # switch to existing worktree
wt merge main                         # squash merge when done
```

The worktree is created as a sibling directory (e.g., `../kro-ui.001-server-core/`).
All work for that spec happens inside its worktree directory.

**Spec-kit integration**: The `/speckit.*` commands detect the current branch
name automatically. They work from any worktree — the branch name maps to the
spec directory in `.specify/specs/`. The `create-new-feature.sh` script uses
`wt switch --create --no-cd` when worktrunk is installed, with a fallback to
`git checkout -b` when it is not.

Hooks (defined in `.config/wt.toml`):
- `post-create`: installs Go + frontend + e2e deps
- `post-start`: copies node_modules/web/dist caches (avoids cold start)
- `pre-commit`: `go vet` + TypeScript typecheck
- `pre-merge`: `go test -race` + `go build`
- `list.url`: `http://localhost:{hash_port}` per worktree

---

## Go module quirk

`proxy.golang.org` is blocked in this environment. All `go` commands that
download modules MUST use:

```bash
GOPROXY=direct GONOSUMDB="*" go ...
```

The Makefile `go` and `tidy` targets already set this. Use `make go` and
`make tidy` rather than running `go` directly.

---

## Key architectural decisions

### Backend (Go)

- **Dynamic client everywhere**: `k8s.io/client-go/dynamic` for all kro
  resources. No typed clients. This is what makes the UI survive kro API changes.
- **Discovery-based pluralization**: `discovery.ServerResourcesForGroupVersion`
  before any naive `kind + "s"` fallback.
- **`ClientFactory`**: holds dynamic + discovery clients, `sync.RWMutex`-protected,
  supports runtime `SwitchContext`.
- **kro field paths isolated**: only `internal/k8s/rgd.go` knows about
  `spec.schema.kind`, `spec.resources[].id`, etc.
- **Upstream kro only**: `specPatch`/`stateFields` are fork-only concepts that
  do NOT exist in `kubernetes-sigs/kro`. Never add them.
 - **Performance budget**: every handler must respond in ≤5s. Discovery results
   must be cached (≥30s). Fan-out list operations use `errgroup` with 5s per-goroutine
   timeout (was 2s; increased in PRs #352/#354 — goroutines run in parallel so handler
   latency ≈ max, not sum). **Never** call `ServerGroupsAndResources()` per-request without caching.
   **Never** loop sequentially over all API resource types — this will hang on
  large clusters (EKS with many controllers routinely has 200+ resource types).
- **No hardcoded config**: never hardcode service account names, ClusterRole names,
  namespace names, or label key values. Derive them from the cluster or expose
  them as configurable with documented defaults.

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- **No CSS frameworks**: Tailwind, Bootstrap, MUI are prohibited. Use
  `web/src/tokens.css` CSS custom properties only.
- **No state management libraries**: plain React state + hooks.
- **No external highlighters**: the kro CEL/schema highlighter is a custom pure
  TS tokenizer in `web/src/lib/highlighter.ts`.
- **Feature flags via `useCapabilities()`**: spec `008-feature-flags` defines
  how features are gated on what the connected kro cluster actually supports.
- **Page titles**: every page MUST update `document.title`. Format: `<content> — kro-ui`.
- **404 route**: `path="*"` catch-all rendering `NotFound` is REQUIRED in the router.
- **Cards are fully clickable**: every resource card's entire body navigates to
  the primary view. Small text links inside cards as the only navigation target
  is a UX violation.
- **Graceful degradation**: absent data (conditions, kinds, fields) renders as
  "not reported" / raw value — never as `?`, `undefined`, `null`, or an error state.
  A `?` kind label on a DAG node is always a bug.

### Known anti-patterns (DO NOT repeat)

These were discovered in production QA. Every one produced a GitHub issue.

| Anti-pattern | Issue | Correct approach |
|---|---|---|
| `ServerGroupsAndResources()` per-request to find child resources | #57 (75s response) | Cache discovery; use label-selector on known GVRs only |
| Rendering absent `status.conditions` entries as "Pending" | #59 | Show "Not reported" for absent expected conditions |
| Mixing schema constraints into the `default` field of `ParsedType` | #60 | Parse `enum=`, `min=`, `max=` as separate named fields |
| Checking `default !== undefined` where `default=0`/`false`/`""` are falsy | #61 | Use `'default' in parsedType` (key existence), not `!== undefined` |
| DAG nodes returning `?` for unresolvable kind | #58 | Fall back to raw `kind` string, then `nodeId` — never `?` |
| Fully ARN context names truncated to ambiguous suffix | #63 | Show account ID fragment + cluster name |
| SVG viewBox not fitted to content after layout | #64 | Measure bounding box after Dagre runs; set height accordingly |
| Resource cards with only small text links as navigation | #65 | Wrap entire card in `<Link>` |
| Filter UI that only works via URL params (no input fields) | #66 | Provide actual input controls; URL params are a bonus |
| Hardcoded `rgba()` / hex in component CSS (e.g. `box-shadow`) | #77 review | Define a named token in `tokens.css` (`--shadow-tooltip`, etc.) and reference via `var()` |
| Portal tooltip without viewport boundary clamping | #77 review | Measure bounding box with `getBoundingClientRect()` in `useEffect`; flip left/top when tooltip overflows right or bottom edge. Apply to ALL portal tooltip components |
| Duplicating `nodeTypeLabel` / `tokenClass` across component files | #77 review | Define once in `@/lib/dag.ts` (or appropriate `@/lib/` module) and import — never copy-paste graph helpers |
| State map keyed by `kind` instead of `kro.run/node-id` label | #278 | Key `buildNodeStateMap` by `kro.run/node-id`; skip children without this label (kube-generated resources) |
| `IN_PROGRESS` kro state not mapped to reconciling | #278 | Check `status.state === 'IN_PROGRESS'` BEFORE checking conditions in `extractInstanceHealth` and `isReconciling()` |
| `items:null` in Go API responses | #278 | Init slices with `make([]T, 0)` not `var items []T`; coerce nil to `[]` before responding |
| External ref DAG nodes showing `not-found` when instance is healthy | #285 | In `buildNodeStateMap` step 3, map `external`/`externalCollection` nodes to `globalState` not `not-found` |
| Using `page.goto()` HTTP status to detect nonexistent SPA routes in E2E | #310 | SPA always returns 200. Use `page.request.get(apiUrl)` to check if the resource exists before navigating |
| E2E journey files not assigned to any Playwright chunk | #310 | Every journey file prefix MUST appear in a `testMatch` pattern in `playwright.config.ts`. Files without a match are silently skipped. |
| Missing `})` closing `test.describe` in E2E journey | #310 | Crashes the Playwright runner before any test runs. Always verify brace depth = 0 after editing journeys |
| `locator.or().toBeVisible()` when both elements may be visible | #310 | Use `waitForFunction()` polling the DOM; `locator.or()` throws when multiple elements match |
| `toHaveCount(0, {timeout:15000})` for skeleton removal | #310 | Use `waitForFunction()` polling the resolved text content; more resilient on slow CI runners |
| Response cache not flushed on context switch | #326 | Call `factory.RegisterContextSwitchHook(rc.Flush)` after creating the cache; stale cluster-A data must never be served on cluster-B |
| `formatAge()` returning "0s" for freshly created objects | #323 | Return "just now" for elapsed < 5s; "0s" at the same visual size as "30m" implies a data value, not "just created" |
| WARNINGS cell counting only expired kube events | #328 | Combine event warnings + `countFailedConditions()` (non-Ready conditions with status=False/Unknown); events expire after ~1h leaving WARNINGS=0 for stuck instances |
| HealthBar chips as non-interactive `<span>` when data is available | #329 | Render as `<button>` with `aria-pressed` when `onFilter` is provided; operators need to click chips to drill down |
| Helm chart missing security context | #330 | Always add `podSecurityContext` + `containerSecurityContext` with `runAsNonRoot`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation=false`, `capabilities.drop=[ALL]` |
| E2E `waitForTimeout(2000)` as data-load guard | #339 | Replace with `waitForFunction` polling the DOM; fixed-ms waits are inherently flaky when the cluster is throttled |
| E2E test asserting kro-managed instance has no finalizers | #339 | kro adds `kro.run/finalizer` to ALL instances — never assert `.not.toBeVisible()` for the FinalizersPanel on a live kro instance |
| E2E context-switcher test using `locator.click()` on dropdown option without waiting for options to load | #341 | Use `waitForFunction()` polling the dropdown for the option text; context list loads from `/api/v1/contexts` which can be slow on throttled clusters |
| `/instances` page using `ready: "True"/"False"` to determine health instead of full 6-state model | #348 | Check `status.state === 'IN_PROGRESS'` FIRST; only then fall back to `ready` condition. IN_PROGRESS instances are "reconciling", not "error" — consistent with Overview/InstanceDetail. |
| Fleet `isInstanceDegraded()` only checking `Ready=False` without excluding IN_PROGRESS | #343 | Check `status.state === 'IN_PROGRESS'` before the Ready condition check; IN_PROGRESS instances are reconciling, not degraded |
| `ListAllInstances` fan-out timeout 2s insufficient on throttled clusters | #352 | Use 5s per-goroutine timeout; goroutines run in parallel so total handler latency ≈ max(individual) not sum(individual). 2s was leaving no time after DiscoverPlural (~1-2s on throttled clusters). |
| `Ready=False` with `ResourcesReady.reason=NotReady` shown as Error | #Carlos | `Ready=False` while waiting for a slow dependency (e.g. RDS takes 8 min) sets `globalState=error` → all nodes show red. Check `ResourcesReady.reason=NotReady` or `message.includes("waiting for node")` — these mean reconciling, not error |
| Live DAG inheriting CR reconciling state to all child nodes | #379 | When globalState=reconciling (CR in IN_PROGRESS), each child should be judged on its own conditions, not inherit amber. Only globalState=error propagates to children. A Namespace or ConfigMap created in wave 1 shows green while a downstream RDS instance is still provisioning. |
| `overflow-y: auto` without `overflow-x: hidden` on scroll containers | CSS | Setting `overflow-y` to a non-`visible` value causes the browser to implicitly promote `overflow-x` from `visible` to `auto`, creating a spurious horizontal scrollbar from sub-pixel rounding or ResizeObserver timing. Always pair `overflow-y: auto/scroll` with `overflow-x: hidden` on containers that should never scroll horizontally. |
| VirtualGrid `itemHeight` constant not matching actual CSS card height | CSS | VirtualGrid uses `itemHeight` for row-offset math. If cards have `min-height` (not `height`), variable content (error hints, extra rows) makes some cards taller than `itemHeight`, causing subsequent rows to be misaligned and the rightmost column to be clipped. Cards MUST have `height: Npx; overflow: hidden` to exactly match the `itemHeight` constant. |

### Upstream kro node types (5 real types + 1 kro-ui extension)

Labels from `NODE_TYPE_LABEL` in `web/src/lib/dag.ts:37-44`.

| NodeType | kro-ui label | Condition |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `NodeTypeInstance` | Root CR | ID = `schema` |
| `NodeTypeResource` | Managed Resource | has `template`, no `forEach` |
| `NodeTypeCollection` | forEach Collection | has `template` + `forEach` |
| `NodeTypeExternal` | External Ref | `externalRef.metadata.name` set |
| `NodeTypeExternalCollection` | External Ref Collection | `externalRef.metadata.selector` set |
| *(kro-ui ext.)* | State Store | has `state:` key, no `template:` — pending upstream NodeTypeState formalization (CA-05) |

`includeWhen` is a **modifier** on any node type, not a separate type.

- Tests: table-driven `build`/`check` pattern, `testify/assert` + `require`,
  `go test -race` always

## E2E tests

Kind cluster, hermetic, fully automated:
```bash
make test-e2e-install   # one-time: install Playwright + Chromium
make test-e2e           # full run (creates kind cluster, runs tests, teardown)
SKIP_KIND_DELETE=true make test-e2e  # keep cluster for iteration
```

Fixtures: `test/e2e/fixtures/` — `test-app` RGD (WebApp kind, 3 resources)
Journeys: `test/e2e/journeys/001-*.spec.ts` through `070-*.spec.ts` (70+ files across 9 parallel Playwright chunks)

---

## CI pipeline

All workflows live in `.github/workflows/`. They run on push to `main` and on
PRs targeting `main`.

### CI (`ci.yml`) — 3 parallel jobs

| Job | What | Blocks merge? |
|-----|------|---------------|
| `build` | `go vet` → `go test -race` → `go build` → `bun typecheck` | Yes |
| `govulncheck` | Go vulnerability scanner. Warns on stdlib-only findings; fails on third-party dependency vulns | Yes |
| `trivy` | Builds Docker image, scans with Trivy for CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs, uploads SARIF to GitHub Security tab | Yes |

**Environment**: All Go steps inherit `GOPROXY=direct GONOSUMDB="*"` set at
workflow level (proxy.golang.org is blocked).

### CodeQL (`codeql.yml`)

- Languages: Go + JavaScript/TypeScript
- Triggers: PRs, push to main, weekly schedule (Monday 06:00 UTC)
- Queries: `security-extended` (broader than default)
- Required status check: `analyze (go)` and `analyze (javascript-typescript)`

### E2E (`e2e.yml`)

- Full Playwright journey suite against a kind cluster
- Installs the kro controller via Helm, applies test fixtures, starts kro-ui binary
- 20-minute timeout
- Uploads Playwright report + traces as artifacts on failure
- **Required status check** — blocks merge on failure

### Release (`release.yml`)

- Triggers on `v*` tags
- Builds + pushes Docker image to `ghcr.io/pnz1990/kro-ui`
- Runs goreleaser for binary releases

---

## Security controls

### Branch protection on `main`

- PRs required — no direct push
- 1 approving review required
- CODEOWNERS review required (auto-assigned)
- Stale reviews dismissed on new push
- Required status checks: `build`, `govulncheck`, `Analyze (go)`, `Analyze (javascript-typescript)`, `e2e`
- Branch must be up to date before merge (strict mode)
- Linear history enforced
- Force push and branch deletion blocked
- Enforced for admins

### Dependency management

- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`): weekly scans for Go modules, npm
  (web + e2e), and GitHub Actions. Automated security fix PRs enabled.
- **Vulnerability alerts**: enabled at repo level

### Scanning

| Scanner | What | Where |
|---------|------|-------|
| CodeQL | Static analysis (SAST) for Go + JS/TS | Every PR + weekly |
| govulncheck | Known Go CVEs in deps and stdlib | Every PR |
| Trivy | Container image CVEs (CRITICAL/HIGH) | Every PR, SARIF → Security tab |
| Dependabot | Dependency version + security alerts | Weekly, auto-PR on findings |

### Repo settings

- Squash merge only (no merge commits, no rebase merge)
- Branches auto-deleted on merge
- `SECURITY.md` documents responsible disclosure via GitHub Security Advisories
- `CODEOWNERS` (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) auto-requests review from @pnz1990

## Where to start

If no spec is in-progress: implement `001-server-core` first.
If a spec branch already exists: check `wt list` to see the current state.

To begin work on a spec, always create a worktree first:
```bash
wt switch --create 001-server-core   # from the main worktree
```
Then operate from the new worktree directory (shown by `wt list`).

### Before writing any code

These files MUST be read at the start of every session:

1. **Spec**: `.specify/specs/<NNN-feature-name>/spec.md` — requirements and
   acceptance criteria for the current feature
2. **Tasks**: `.specify/specs/<NNN-feature-name>/tasks.md` — ordered task
   checklist with phases and dependencies. Execute tasks in order, mark each
   `[x]` as completed. If no tasks.md exists, run `/speckit.tasks` first.
3. **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — non-negotiable rules
   that override everything else
4. **Design system**: `.specify/specs/000-design-system/spec.md` — colors,
   typography, tokens (only needed for frontend work)

The current branch name tells you which spec to read. For example, branch
`001-server-core` maps to `.specify/specs/001-server-core/`.

Always read the spec before writing code. Always run `go vet ./...` and
`tsc --noEmit` before committing.


## Active Technologies
- Go 1.25 backend + TypeScript 5.x + React 19 + React Router v7 + Vite — no new npm or Go dependencies introduced since v0.2.1
- All state is local React `useState`; no persistence layer; no state management libraries
- 6-state `InstanceHealthState` (ready/degraded/reconciling/error/pending/unknown); state map keyed by `kro.run/node-id` label (not by kind)
- kro v0.9.1 API: GraphRevision CRD + `kro.run/graph-revision-hash` label, scope badge, capabilities baseline (`hasGraphRevisions`, `hasExternalRefSelector`, `hasCELOmitFunction`); CEL hash functions `hash.fnv64a/sha256/md5`; `kro.run/reconcile=suspended` canonical annotation (also accepts legacy `disabled`)
- Stress-test fixture RGDs on kind cluster: `never-ready`, `invalid-cel-rgd`, `typed-schema`, `optimization-candidate`, `triple-config`, `crashloop-app`, `multi-ns-app`, `multi-conditional`, `deep-dependency-chain`, `large-schema`, `multi-hpa-app`, `webapp-with-pdb`, `secret-configmap-pair`, `cross-namespace-config`
- TypeScript 5.x / React 19 / Vite + React Router v7 (navigation), existing `@/lib/api` and `@/lib/format` (no new deps) (062-overview-sre-dashboard)
- `localStorage` (layout mode key `"overview-layout"`, chart mode key `"overview-health-chart"`) (062-overview-sre-dashboard)
