## Architecture

Read ARCHITECTURE.md before structural changes: it documents the generation
pipeline (load → parse → normalize → generate → emit), the NormalizedSpec IR,
the shared emission layer, the plugin contract, typed errors, and the
"where does X go" rules. Key invariants: generators consume the IR (never raw
specs or $refs), shared emission fragments live in packages/shared/src/emit/,
and `console.*` exists only in cli.ts.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
