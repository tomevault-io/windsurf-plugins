## Activation preflight

Run this check once at the top of the first skill invocation in a session (and at the top of every `/`-command in `content/commands/`). It is fast, silent when active, and governs whether the methodology runs at all in the current project. Keep it to three file reads with no subagent spawn and no LLM reasoning. **Exception:** Step 6 (Scaffolding-sync check) is the single authorized side-effecting exception to this invariant. It calls `bin/agentic-migrate` as a bounded shell-out; the binary is methodology-owned, failure is swallowed, and it never blocks activation.

1. **Read the global mode, profile, and preset.** Load `~/.claude/agentic-engineering.json`. If missing or unreadable, assume `mode=opt-out`, `profile=default`, and `preset=null` (back-compat). Expected shape: `{ "mode": "opt-out" | "opt-in", "profile": "relaxed" | "default" | "strict", "preset": "lean" | "standard" | "strict" | null, "set_at": "<ISO8601>" }`. Any `mode` value other than `opt-in` is treated as `opt-out`. Any `profile` value other than `relaxed` or `strict` is treated as `default`. The `preset` field is optional; when present and non-null, it RESOLVES to a profile via the preset table below and overrides the direct `profile` field. When `preset` is null or missing, the direct `profile` field is used (back-compat).

   Also read the **effective identity** for this session. Check `<cwd>/.agentic/identity.yml` first, then fall back to `~/.agentic/identity.yml`. Use the first file that exists, resolving by the 4-tier confirmation ordering: project-confirmed > global-confirmed > project-provisional > global-provisional > none. In practice this is a two-file read: if the project file exists and is confirmed (no `provisional: true`), use it. If the project file is provisional, also read the global file; if the global is confirmed, prefer the global. Otherwise use the project file. Record `developer_id` and `provisional` from whichever file wins. Absent file or absent `provisional` field = confirmed identity (Python `.get('provisional', False)`; JS `provisional === true`). **This is a read-only field parse - no prompt, no shell-out, no LLM reasoning. The "fast, silent" preflight invariant is preserved.** When `provisional: true` is recorded on the effective identity, the conductor surfaces a non-blocking confirmation notice at its first user-facing turn (see §Session Context and Memory in `content/rules/conventions.md`).

   **Preset table (session-wide risk profile preset):**

   | Preset    | Resolves to profile |
   |-----------|---------------------|
   | lean      | relaxed             |
   | standard  | default             |
   | strict    | strict              |

   Note: this session-wide `preset` field is distinct from the per-spawn `Preset:` declaration introduced in the Tier declaration section below. The session-wide preset is a tone setting; the per-spawn preset is a capability bundle. Both terms use "preset" intentionally - context disambiguates.
2. **Read the project marker.** Look for a root `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory. If the project uses the Claude Code `@AGENTS.md` import pattern, `CLAUDE.md` will point at it - resolve through to the actual `AGENTS.md`. If neither file exists, treat marker as `none`.
3. **Scan for marker lines.** Case-insensitive, whole-line match (allow leading or trailing whitespace, and an optional markdown list prefix `- `):
   - `agentic-engineering: opt-in`
   - `agentic-engineering: opt-out`
   If both appear, the one that appears FIRST wins; print a one-line warning: `agentic-engineering: both opt-in and opt-out markers found in AGENTS.md - using the first one (<value>). Remove the duplicate.`
   Also scan for `agentic-engineering-profile: <value>`. If present, it overrides the global profile. Valid values: `relaxed`, `default`, `strict`. Any other value falls back to the global profile.
   Also scan for `agentic-engineering-preset: <value>`. If present, it overrides the resolved global preset for this project. Valid values: `lean`, `standard`, `strict`. The project preset is resolved through the same preset table (above) to a profile; that resolved profile overrides any direct `agentic-engineering-profile:` line in the same file (preset wins on collision because it is the higher-level knob). Any other value falls back to the global preset/profile resolution.
4. **Activation decision.**
   - `mode=opt-out` AND `marker=opt-out` - skill no-ops silently; fall back to default Claude Code behavior for this session.
   - `mode=opt-in` AND `marker != opt-in` - skill no-ops silently; fall back to default behavior.
   - Any other combination (including `marker=none` with `mode=opt-out`, or `marker=opt-in` with `mode=opt-in`) - proceed with the methodology.
5. **First-activation notice (one-time, per-project, TTY-only).** Triggered only when Step 4 resolved to active (any proceed branch). Otherwise skip this step entirely.
