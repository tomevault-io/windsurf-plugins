# Module Manifests

## What it is

A module manifest is a short header block at the top of a non-trivial source file. It lives in the code itself so that comprehension travels with the code — not in Architect plans that get discarded after merge, not in wikis that drift, not in PR descriptions nobody reads six months later. This is the self-describing layer of the system: a reader should be able to open a file and immediately understand what it does, what it depends on, and what breaks if it misbehaves.

## When required

**Required** for any source file that meets one or more of these criteria:

- Exports a public symbol (function, class, type, constant) consumed by another module
- Over ~50 lines of non-trivial logic
- Implements a side-effecting operation: network call, disk I/O, database access, external service interaction, or any operation that cannot be safely retried without thought

**Exempt:**

- Test files and test fixtures
- Generated files (migration outputs, protobuf outputs, GraphQL codegen, etc.)
- One-off scripts not imported by anything else
- Trivial pure utility files (thin wrappers, simple formatters, constants-only files)

**Modified files:** a manifest must be updated when changes meaningfully alter purpose, public API, upstream dependencies, or failure/retry semantics. A manifest that no longer reflects the file is worse than no manifest — it is active misinformation.

## Required fields

Every manifest must cover these six fields. Omit a field only if it genuinely does not apply (e.g., "Performance: standard" is acceptable shorthand; leaving a failure modes field blank is not):

| Field | What to say |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | One sentence. What this module does and why it exists. |
| **Public API** | The exports or entry points a caller should use. Not an exhaustive type dump — the canonical surface. |
| **Upstream dependencies** | What this module imports, calls, or consumes that it does not own. External libraries, internal modules, environment variables, config values. |
| **Downstream consumers** | Who uses this module. Best-effort: list known callers. "Unknown at creation" is acceptable for new modules; update it when consumers are identified. |
| **Failure modes** | How this module fails, and what the caller needs to know about retrying or recovering. Idempotency guarantees or lack thereof. |
| **Performance** | Expected latency, throughput, or memory profile if non-obvious. Omit or write "standard" if there is nothing a caller needs to know. |

## Format

Use the idiomatic comment or docstring syntax for the language. Do not invent a schema or force a rigid structure — the fields are required, the exact syntax is per-language.

**TypeScript / JavaScript:**

```typescript
/**
 * Purpose: Validates and normalizes incoming webhook payloads before they
 *          enter the processing pipeline.
 *
 * Public API: validateWebhook(raw: unknown): WebhookPayload
 *
 * Upstream deps: zod (schema validation), ./types (WebhookPayload type)
 *
 * Downstream consumers: src/handlers/webhook.ts, src/workers/ingest.ts
 *
 * Failure modes: throws WebhookValidationError on malformed input — callers
 *                must catch and return 400, not 500. No side effects; safe to
 *                retry or call multiple times on the same input.
 *
 * Performance: ~0.2 ms per call; zod parse is synchronous, no I/O.
 */
```

**Python:**

```python
"""
Purpose: Resolves feature flag values for a given user context, with local
         cache to avoid repeated network calls within a request lifecycle.

Public API: get_flag(flag_name: str, context: UserContext) -> bool

Upstream deps: flagsmith SDK, app.cache (RequestScopeCache), config.FLAGSMITH_URL

Downstream consumers: app.views.experiment, app.middleware.ab_test

Failure modes: falls back to flag default on SDK timeout or network error —
               never raises; callers can rely on always receiving a bool.
               Cache is request-scoped; not safe to share across threads.

Performance: first call per flag per request hits network (~50 ms);
             subsequent calls within the same request hit local cache (<1 ms).
"""
```

## Why

Comprehension should live in the code. An Architect plan describes what was decided; it does not travel with the file when the file is moved, refactored, or read by an engineer three months later who was not in that session. A module manifest embeds the essential context — the "why does this exist and what breaks if I change it" — directly in the artifact that persists. This is the self-describing layer of the dark code framework: systems that communicate their own structure rather than requiring external documentation to make sense of them.
