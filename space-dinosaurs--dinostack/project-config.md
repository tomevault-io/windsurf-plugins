## Documentation Lookups

**When investigating, diagnosing, or reasoning about library, framework, or SDK behavior, look up current documentation using Context7 before forming conclusions.** Training data may be outdated - API signatures, configuration options, default behaviors, and error messages change across versions.

Use Context7 (`resolve-library-id` -> `query-docs`) for:
- Verifying API signatures, method parameters, or return types
- Checking configuration options or default values
- Understanding error messages or behavioral changes across versions
- Any assumption about library behavior that influences a diagnosis or recommendation

Do not rely on training knowledge for library-specific details when Context7 is available. This applies to all agents: investigators, debuggers, architects, and engineers.

## Tool Discipline

**Never use Bash to read files, list directories, or search content.** Use the dedicated tools - they don't trigger permission prompts and give better output:
- Read files: `Read` tool (never `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`)
- List/find files: `Glob` tool (never `ls`, `find`)
- Search content: `Grep` tool (never `grep`, `rg`)

Reserve `Bash` exclusively for: builds, installs, git operations, network calls, process management, and anything no dedicated tool covers.

Exception: `sg` (AST-grep) for structural symbol-level searches is run via Bash - no dedicated harness tool wraps it. Check availability with `which sg 2>/dev/null` before use.

## Context Window Management

**When `ctx_execute` or `ctx_batch_execute` MCP tools are available, prefer them over raw `Bash` for any operation expected to produce more than ~20 lines of output.** Raw Bash output enters the context window in full; context-mode tools sandbox execution into isolated subprocesses and only let stdout enter context - reducing context consumption by up to 98%.

Key tools and their uses:
- `ctx_execute(language, code)` - run a single script; only stdout enters context
- `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` - analyze a file for inspection only; use `Read` instead when you intend to subsequently `Edit` the file

> Never use `ctx_execute` or `ctx_execute_file` to create or modify files - these tools are for analysis, processing, and computation only. Use the native `Write`/`Edit` tools for all file writes.

- `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` - run multiple commands and search results in one call; replaces 10-30 Bash + search steps
- `ctx_index(content, source)` / `ctx_search(queries)` - build and query a knowledge base from arbitrary content
- `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` - fetch a URL, index it, cache for 24 hours

> When ctx tools are available, prefer `ctx_fetch_and_index` over `WebFetch` for URL fetches - `WebFetch` pulls full page content into context.

**Raw Bash remains appropriate per the Tool Discipline rule above** - `git`, builds, installs, process management, and any operation that needs direct filesystem side effects.

**Platform support:** fully supported on Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Kimi, and oh-my-pi. The tools are available when `ctx_execute` is present as a callable tool in the session. When unavailable, fall back to the `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` discipline above.

## Module Manifests

**Non-trivial modules should carry a manifest header.** Any source file that exports a public symbol consumed by another module, is over ~50 lines of non-trivial logic, or implements a side-effecting operation (network, disk, database, external service) is encouraged to include a manifest comment or docstring at the top of the file. See `content/rules/module-manifest.md` for required fields, examples, and exemptions. Skeptic applies tiered enforcement: missing manifests are **Minor** (does not block sign-off), stale manifests are **Major** (blocks sign-off absent a compelling documented reason to defer), and stale manifests whose inaccuracy could mislead a caller on a correctness or security path are **Critical**. See `content/rules/module-manifest.md` for the full policy.

## DRY and Abstraction

**Do not Repeat Yourself. Engineers must actively scan their own output for duplication before declaring work complete.**

- **Repeated logic** — any block that appears more than once with identical or near-identical structure must be extracted into a helper, utility, or shared component.
- **Copy-paste with tweaks** — copying code and changing only names or constants is a strong signal for abstraction, not a valid implementation strategy.
- **Existing utilities first** — before writing new code, grep the codebase for functions that already solve the sub-problem. Prefer calling an existing utility over reimplementing it.
- **Follow established patterns** — if the codebase has a convention for this class of problem (validation schemas, error wrappers, React hooks, data transformers), use it.
- **Intentional exceptions** — if duplication is genuinely appropriate (the two paths are about to diverge significantly, or extraction would obscure meaning), state the reason explicitly in the output.

The Skeptic review layer enforces this: duplication and missed abstractions are **Major** findings that block sign-off unless justified.
