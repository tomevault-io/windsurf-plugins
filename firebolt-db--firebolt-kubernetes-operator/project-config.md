# CLAUDE.md

## Agent Configuration
This repository follows the **AGENTS.md** specification (https://agents.md/).
- **Hierarchy:** Always check for an `AGENTS.md` file in the root directory for project-wide context.
- **Scoped Instructions:** `AGENTS.md` files may also live in **subfolders**. Those provide more granular, module-scoped instructions. Always prioritize the most local `AGENTS.md` relative to the files you are editing, falling back to the root for project-wide rules.

## Skills & Capabilities
This repository uses **Agent Skills** (https://agentskills.io/).
- **Location:** Skills live in `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- **Usage:** Read the relevant `SKILL.md` before performing the task it covers, so your actions match the project's standard workflows.

## Workflow
- Before performing a task, read the relevant `AGENTS.md` files (most-local first, then root).
- Use the available skills under `.agents/skills/` rather than reinventing project-specific workflows.
