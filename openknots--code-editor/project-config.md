# Use Proxy Rewrites, Not Middleware

This project handles routing, proxying, and request forwarding through Next.js `rewrites` in `next.config.ts` — **not** through `middleware.ts`.

## Rules

- **Never create or modify `middleware.ts`** for proxying, redirecting, or forwarding requests. Use `rewrites` (or `redirects`) in `next.config.ts` instead.
- If you need to proxy an external API, add a `rewrites()` entry in `next.config.ts`:

```ts
async rewrites() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/api/proxy/:path*',
      destination: 'https://external-api.example.com/:path*',
    },
  ]
}
```

- For auth-gated or IP-restricted routes, use **API route handlers** (`app/api/*/route.ts`) with server-side checks, not middleware interception.
- Security headers belong in `next.config.ts` via the `headers()` function, not middleware.
- CORS handling should use `headers()` in `next.config.ts` or per-route API handler logic.

## Why

- `middleware.ts` runs on the Edge Runtime with limited Node.js API support, making it fragile for complex logic.
- `rewrites` are declarative, easier to audit, and handled at the routing layer before code executes.
- Keeping proxy/routing config in `next.config.ts` provides a single source of truth for all request routing.
