# Agents

Instructions for AI coding agents working on this project.

## Project Overview

Livery is a BEAM-native web framework that serves one handler set
over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 from a single service runtime
(the spirit of Axum + Tower + Hyper on the BEAM). The wire layer is
delegated to sibling hex libraries; Livery owns the developer
surface. One OTP application; core runtime stays at the `src/` top
level, with subsystems grouped into domain subdirectories (rebar3
compiles `src/` recursively):

```
src/            Core runtime, flat: livery, livery_req, livery_resp,
                livery_router, livery_service, livery_h1/h2/h3,
                livery_ws*, livery_wt, livery_mcp, livery_openapi,
                livery_static, livery_metrics, ... (+ livery.app.src)
src/client/     Outbound HTTP client: livery_client + its layers,
                stores, adapter, and discovery
src/middleware/ livery_middleware framework + cross-cutting middlewares
                (request_id, access_log, cors, etag, timeout, ratelimit
                (+ store), concurrency, security_headers, alt_svc,
                instrument_*, openapi_validate, body_limit)
src/auth/       Auth middlewares + helpers (bearer, introspect, session,
                jwks, oidc, livery_auth)
src/codec/      Content-coding subsystem (livery_compress + codecs)
include/    Shared records (livery.hrl)
test/       EUnit + Common Test (incl. the cross-adapter parity SUITE
            and livery_e2e_SUITE, a full journey over H1/H2/H3)
bench/      Load/latency harness (separate `bench` rebar profile)
examples/   Runnable example apps (`examples` rebar profile)
docs/       Diataxis docs (tutorials/guides/concepts) + design notes
```

Wire dependencies (`h1`, `h2`, `quic`, `ws`, `webtransport`,
`instrument`, `barrel_mcp`) are git deps in `rebar.config`. Local
development overrides them with `_checkouts/` symlinks to the
sibling projects; `_checkouts/` is gitignored. Never reimplement
HPACK/QPACK/frame/QUIC logic here: that lives in the wire libs;
keep the adapters thin and push changes upstream.

Authoritative behaviour is the test suites under `test/` (the
parity SUITE diffs externally observable behaviour across all four
adapters) and the module docs.

## Required Checks

Every change must be formatted and pass all checks before committing:

```bash
rebar3 fmt          # Auto-format (always run first)
rebar3 compile      # Must compile cleanly (warnings_as_errors)
rebar3 lint         # Elvis linter
rebar3 xref         # Cross-reference analysis
rebar3 dialyzer     # Type checking
rebar3 eunit        # Unit + property tests
rebar3 ct           # Common Test (adapters, parity, service, ws, wt, mcp)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `format`, `lint`, `xref`, and
`dialyzer` as fast-fail static checks, then gates `build`/`eunit`/
`ct` on them.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
rebar3 compile                              # Build
rebar3 shell                                # Boot a dev shell
rebar3 ct --suite=test/livery_parity_SUITE  # One suite
rebar3 fmt                                   # Auto-format (erlfmt)
rebar3 fmt --check                           # Format check, no writes
rebar3 lint                                  # Elvis linter
rebar3 as bench shell                        # Benchmark harness (livery_bench)
```

## Architecture

### Service runtime

`livery:start_service/1` brings H3 (UDP), H2 (TLS), and H1 (TCP) up
together under one `livery_service` gen_server, sharing one router
and middleware stack, and advertising `Alt-Svc` for H3 on H1/H2
responses. `livery:start_listener/2` serves a single protocol.
`livery_drain` gives graceful shutdown (stop accepting, wait for
in-flight, then stop).

### Per-request worker model

Each adapter, on a new request, spawns a `livery_req_proc` child of
the single global `livery_req_sup` (simple_one_for_one) and returns
immediately. A per-stream "translator" process forwards wire events
(`{h1_stream,_}` / `{h2,_}` / `{quic_h3,_}`) to the worker as
`{livery_body, Ref, _}` messages; the translator monitors the
worker and exits on its `DOWN`. Middleware and the handler run in
the worker, which may block/`receive` (the `cowboy_loop` analogue).

### Middleware (Tower/Axum style)

`call(Req, Next, State) -> Resp`: a continuation over immutable
values, not the legacy `(req, res, next)` mutate-and-next model.
Routes may carry a per-route stack under the route `Meta`'s
`middleware` key.

### Dispatch and emit

The handler returns a `#livery_resp{}`; `livery:emit/3` walks the
body variant (`full` / `chunked` / `sse` / `file` / `empty` /
`upgrade`) and drives `Adapter:send_headers/send_data/send_trailers`.
The `taken_over` sentinel tells `emit/3` to stop because the stream
was handed off (WebSocket, WebTransport, MCP).

### Adapter behaviour

`livery_adapter` defines `start/3`, `stop/1`, `send_headers/4`,
`send_data/3`, `send_trailers/2`, `reset/2`, `peer_info/1`,
`capabilities/1`. Implemented by `livery_h1`, `livery_h2`,
`livery_h3`, and `livery_test_adapter` (in-memory, used by the
parity SUITE).

## Conventions

- Run `rebar3 fmt` before committing; elvis must pass. New
  per-module elvis ignores belong in `rebar.config` with a one-line
  reason.
