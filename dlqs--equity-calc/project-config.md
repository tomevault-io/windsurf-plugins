# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A Texas Hold'em poker equity calculator with visual card selection and poker table interface. Client-side only implementation for 2-6 players.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Pure vanilla implementation, no frameworks
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design for touch interfaces
- **Client-side only**: No server dependencies

## Development Commands

```bash
# Serve locally (any simple HTTP server)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Card System** (`cards.js`):
   - 52-card deck representation
   - Card selection and validation logic
   - Visual card components

2. **Poker Table UI** (`table.js`):
   - Visual poker table layout
   - Player position management (2-6 players)
   - Community cards area

3. **Equity Calculator** (`equity.js`):
   - Monte Carlo simulation engine
   - Hand evaluation algorithm
   - Win probability calculations

4. **UI Controllers** (`app.js`):
   - Card selection interactions
   - Player management
   - Results display

### File Structure
