    ```

4.  **Visit**: [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)

### Development Commands

*   **Run tests**: `mix test`
*   **Check code quality**: `mix check` (includes formatting, linting, dialyzer, tests, and docs)
*   **Live reload**: Assets are compiled automatically with esbuild.

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style**: The project follows the standard Elixir and Phoenix conventions. Use `mix format` to format the code and `mix credo --strict` to check for style issues.
*   **Testing**: All new features should be accompanied by tests. The `mix check` command includes a test run.
*   **Contributions**: Before pushing changes, ensure that `mix check` passes. Update documentation as needed.
