# alp-river

Project-specific rules for this plugin repo. The pipeline workflow lives in `WORKFLOW.md`. Global rules live in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. This file does not ship to consumers - Claude Code only loads CLAUDE.md from the user's working directory.

## Versioning

Plugin version lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. The same version is mirrored in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - bump both together.

- **Patch bump** after a successful task when the workflow itself changes: anything under `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, or `WORKFLOW.md`. Same trigger: add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and update `README.md` if the public surface description shifts.
- **No bump** for doc-only changes (README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE.md, comment polish). `marketplace.json` listing edits (description, keywords) are metadata, not workflow.
- **Minor and major** are manual. Don't auto-bump.

## CHANGELOG style

See `WORKFLOW.md` § "Changelog Style" - one canonical home for the rules.

## Doctrine hygiene

Before adding an instruction anywhere under `agents/`, `doctrine/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, or `WORKFLOW.md`, run a three-check meta-rule:

1. **Does an existing channel or slot already carry this?** If a map, contract, or section already owns the fact, extend it not restate - one home, not a second copy somewhere a reader will diverge from.
2. **Is the fact defined exactly once?** A rule repeated across files drifts: one copy gets edited, the other rots. Pick the canonical home and cross-reference it ("See doctrine/...") from anywhere else that needs to point at it.
3. **Does a cheap canary protect it?** A load-bearing literal earns a short pinned phrase the self-audit watches, so deleting or rewording it past recognition trips the doctrine-integrity check instead of silently rotting.

This rule binds this repo's own changes - it governs how alp-river is authored, not anything shipped to a consumer. Its teeth are exactly two: the self-audit's doctrine-hygiene lens (which flags an instruction line duplicated verbatim across `agents/`/`doctrine/`) plus author discipline at edit time. CLAUDE.md itself is neither shipped nor injected into any agent, so nothing enforces this for you automatically - the lens catches cross-file duplication after the fact, and the rest is the author honoring the three checks above.

## Leitwort usage

A leitwort is a leading word: a short, memorable phrase an agent restates in its own reasoning to steer its own behavior. When authoring an agent, persona, or doctrine stage, anchor its core stance on one, and prefer a phrase with trained lineage the model already carries ("deletion test", "tracer bullet", "test seams", "YAGNI ladder", "name the danger") over a coined one.

1. **Anchor over enumerate.** Give a stage one named leitwort and let its checklist of concerns hang off that anchor as supporting detail; a flat list with no anchor is the weakest form.
2. **Reinforce it.** A leitwort used once is inert. Recur it through the file, and where the agent acts have it restate the phrase in its own voice so the words enter the reasoning trace - the `## Anchor` line each `psychology/` persona carries is the canonical example, vocalized via the directive in `hooks/user-context-injector.sh`.
3. **One concept, one name.** Naming the same idea two ways across stages dilutes both; pick the canonical phrase and reuse it verbatim.
4. **Keep it earned.** A job that reads fine as a literal instruction stays literal; a forced or fluffy coinage with no trained association tickles nothing and just spends words.
