# Ghost OS -- Developer Guide

Accessibility-first perception and execution engine that gives AI agents the
ability to see, understand, and operate any macOS application through the
accessibility tree and visual perception.

## Build & Run

```bash
swift build                          # Requires Swift 6.2+ (swiftly), macOS 14+
.build/debug/ghost mcp               # Start MCP server (stdio)
.build/debug/ghost setup             # Interactive first-run wizard
.build/debug/ghost doctor            # Diagnostic health check
.build/debug/ghost status            # Quick status
.build/debug/ghost version           # Version info
```

Release: `scripts/build-release.sh` builds tarball, verifies 3-way version
consistency (Types.swift + server.py + ghost-vision), and codesigns the binary.

## Architecture

MCP-first, single-threaded synchronous. No persistent daemon, no socket IPC, no
async state model. Every MCP tool call queries the AX tree fresh.

```
AI Agent (Claude Code / Cursor / any MCP client)
    |
    | MCP Protocol (stdio, auto-detects Content-Length vs NDJSON)
    |
ghost mcp (Swift binary, @MainActor)
    |
    +-- Perception (7 tools)  -- AX tree via AXorcist
    +-- Annotate (1 tool)     -- Set-of-Marks labeled screenshots, zero ML
    +-- Actions (10 tools)    -- AX-native -> CDP -> VLM -> synthetic cascade
    +-- Wait (1 tool)         -- 6 polling condition types
    +-- Recipes (5 tools)     -- JSON workflow storage and execution
    +-- Vision (2 tools)      -- ShowUI-2B VLM via Python sidecar
    +-- Learning (3 tools)    -- CGEvent tap recording for recipe synthesis
    |
    +-- AXorcist (github.com/steipete/AXorcist, from: "0.1.0")
    +-- ScreenCaptureKit (linked framework)
```

The learning subsystem is the one exception to single-threaded: CGEvent tap runs
on a dedicated nonisolated background Thread with os_unfair_lock and CFRunLoop.

**stdout is sacred.** All MCP protocol data flows through stdout. A single stray
`print()` or `Swift.print()` will corrupt the protocol and break the connection.
All logging goes through `Log` (writes to stderr).

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `Sources/GhostOS/MCP/MCPTools.swift` | All 29 tool definitions (the agent-facing contract) |
| `Sources/GhostOS/MCP/MCPDispatch.swift` | Tool routing and response formatting |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Perception/Perception.swift` | AX tree reading, semantic depth tunneling |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Actions/Actions.swift` | Multi-strategy click/type (AX -> CDP -> VLM -> synthetic) |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Recipes/RecipeEngine.swift` | Step-by-step execution with preconditions and wait conditions |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Learning/LearningRecorder.swift` | CGEvent tap + AX enrichment for recording user actions |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Vision/VisionBridge.swift` | ShowUI-2B VLM grounding via Python sidecar |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Vision/VisionPerception.swift` | ghost_ground (works) and ghost_parse_screen (stub, YOLO not implemented) |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Perception/Annotate.swift` | Set-of-Marks annotation (AX-powered, zero ML) |
| `Sources/GhostOS/Screenshot/ScreenCapture.swift` | Window screenshots via ScreenCaptureKit (captures background windows) |
| `GHOST-MCP.md` | 13 rules for agents using Ghost OS tools + recipe JSON schema |

## 29 MCP Tools

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Perception (7) | context, state, find, read, inspect, element_at, screenshot |
| Annotate (1) | annotate |
| Actions (10) | click, type, press, hotkey, scroll, hover, long_press, drag, focus, window |
| Wait (1) | wait (urlContains, titleContains, elementExists, elementGone, urlEquals, titleEquals) |
| Recipes (5) | recipes, run, recipe_show, recipe_save, recipe_delete |
| Vision (2) | ground, parse_screen |
| Learning (3) | learn_start, learn_stop, learn_status |

**Note:** `ghost_ground` sends a description to the ShowUI-2B vision model and
returns click coordinates. `ghost_parse_screen` is a stub (the YOLO detection
endpoint is not yet implemented). For detecting all interactive elements without
ML, use `ghost_annotate` instead (AX-powered Set-of-Marks).

## AXorcist APIs We Use

Ghost OS depends on AXorcist for all accessibility tree access. Check
AXorcist source at `../AXorcist/Sources/AXorcist/` before building new features.

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `Element.children()` | Walk element tree (checks 14+ alternative attributes) |
| `Element.title()`, `.descriptionText()`, `.value()` | Read element text |
| `Element.visibleCharacterRange()` + `.string(forRange:)` | Web content text |
| `Element.numberOfCharacters()` | Text length for range-based extraction |
| `Element.role()`, `.position()`, `.size()` | Element metadata |
| `Element.performAction(.press)` | Click elements via AX |
| `Element.typeText(text, delay:)` | Reliable typing with configurable delay |
| `Element.url()` | Read AXURL from web areas (page URL) |
| `Element.isEditable()` | Check if focused element is a text field |
| `InputDriver.click()`, `.tapKey()`, `.hotkey()` | Synthetic input |
| `AXObserverCenter` | Real-time AX notifications |
| `AccessibilityPermissions` | Permission checking |

## Code Conventions

- Swift 6.2 strict concurrency. @MainActor default isolation.
