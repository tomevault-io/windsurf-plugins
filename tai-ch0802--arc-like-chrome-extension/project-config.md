# Arc-like Chrome Extension - Code Review Guidelines

## Project Context

This is a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) providing an Arc-browser-style sidebar for tab and bookmark management.

**Tech Stack:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Chrome APIs: `chrome.sidePanel`, `chrome.tabs`, `chrome.tabGroups`, `chrome.bookmarks`, `chrome.storage`

**Architecture Pattern:**
- Modular structure under `modules/`
- Facade pattern for UI modules (`modules/uiManager.js`)
- Centralized icons in `modules/icons.js`

## Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Compliance

This project follows **Spec-Driven Development**. All features and fixes should have corresponding specification documents before implementation.

### Spec Location

Specs are stored in `/docs/specs/` with the following structure:

```
/docs/specs/
  ├── feature/
  │    └── {ID_PREFIX}_{desc}/
  │         ├── PRD_spec.md    # Product Requirements
  │         └── SA_spec.md     # System Analysis
  └── fix/
       └── {ID_PREFIX}_{desc}/
            ├── PRD_spec.md
            └── SA_spec.md
```

**ID_PREFIX types:**
- `ISSUE-{num}`: Corresponds to GitHub Issue
- `PR-{num}`: External PR without Issue
- `BASE-{num}`: Initial or baseline specs

### Key Review Checks for SDD PRs

When a PR **includes changes to `docs/specs/**`**, verify:

1. **Requirement Traceability**: Check if `SA_spec.md` contains a Traceability Matrix that maps:
   - `Req ID` → `PRD Section` → `SA Section` → `Implementation File`

2. **Implementation Files Match**: Verify that code files modified in the PR are listed in the SA's Traceability Matrix.

3. **New Files Documented**: If new files are created, check if they are marked as `[NEW]` in the SA spec.

4. **Acceptance Criteria Coverage**: Review if PRD's Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin format) are addressed by the implementation.

### Skip Condition

> **If the PR does NOT include any changes to files under `docs/specs/`**, skip all SDD-related checks above and proceed with standard code review only.

## Code Quality Standards

### JavaScript

- Use descriptive, intention-revealing variable names
- Functions should be focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Avoid hardcoded SVG/icons; use `modules/icons.js` instead
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed
- Handle errors appropriately with try-catch for async operations

### Code Style

```javascript
// Prefer
const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.isActive);

// Avoid
const x = users.filter(u => u.active);
```

### Chrome Extension Specific

- Always check API availability before use
- Use `chrome.i18n.getMessage()` for user-facing strings
- Store persistent data in `chrome.storage.sync` for cross-device sync

---

## Security Considerations

- Never hardcode secrets or API keys
- Validate all user inputs, especially for import/export features
- Use `style.setProperty()` for dynamic CSS, avoid `innerHTML` for user content

---

## Review Style

- Be specific and actionable in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Acknowledge good patterns when observed
- Use Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) for comments when reviewing this repository
