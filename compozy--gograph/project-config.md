# Code Review Checklist

## Pre-Review Requirements

<pre_review_requirements>
Before submitting code for review, ensure:
- All tests pass and follow the established testing patterns
- Code has been formatted with `go fmt`
- All linter warnings have been addressed
- Error handling follows project patterns
- Security considerations have been addressed
</pre_review_requirements>

## Review Checklist

<checklist type="code_review">
1. Does the code follow the established project structure and patterns?
2. Are errors handled appropriately and with context?
3. Is the code well-tested with both unit and integration tests?
4. Are interfaces used appropriately to define behavior?
5. Does the code pass all linter checks?
6. Is the code secure and performant?
7. Are dependencies injected properly?
8. Is context propagated correctly?
9. Is the code simple, readable, and maintainable?
</checklist>

## Common Issues to Watch For

<common_issues type="code_quality">
- Missing error handling or inappropriate error propagation
- Tests that don't follow the `t.Run("Should...")` pattern
- Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Missing context propagation in functions that make external calls
- Security vulnerabilities like exposed secrets or unvalidated inputs
- Performance issues like unnecessary allocations or inefficient algorithms
- Code that doesn't follow established project patterns
- Missing or inadequate test coverage
</common_issues>

## Review Process

<review_process>
- Focus on correctness, maintainability, and adherence to standards
- Check for proper error handling and testing patterns
- Verify security considerations have been addressed
- Ensure code follows established project patterns and conventions
- Look for opportunities to improve code clarity and efficiency
</review_process>
