# OpenWorld — working notes for Claude

Zero-dependency Python framework for **symbolic, verified-code world models** with
a local Ollama backbone. These rules override default behavior.

## Branching & PRs (read this first)

- **Base every new experiment branch directly on `main`. Every PR targets `main`.**
- **Never stack a PR onto another experiment's branch.** Stacked PRs that target a
  sibling branch get *stranded*: when the parent branch merges to main first, the
  child merges into a dead branch and never reaches main. (This happened to E45
  real-repo, then to E45 next-token + E47 — each "merged" but absent from main.)
- The only cost of basing on main is a trivial collision in three spots, resolved
  at merge time: the `\NumExperiments` macro, the `EXPERIMENTS` list, and the
  registration calls in `scripts/make_paper_assets.py` `main()`. Fix those by hand
  in the PR; do not stack to avoid them.
- **One change → one branch → one PR.** Once a PR is merged, that branch is *done*:
  do **not** push more commits to it — a merged/closed PR ignores later pushes, so
  they never reach `main` (they "orphan"). Start a **fresh branch off updated
  `main`** for the next change. If you already pushed post-merge commits to a stale
  branch, cherry-pick them onto a fresh branch off `main` and open a new PR.
  (This bit us repeatedly: serve/README/view follow-ups merged at an earlier
  commit and had to be re-PR'd.)
- The human merges PRs quickly, so **finish and push a change before it's merged**,
  and when several changes touch the same file (`openworld/serve.py`,
  `papers/*/main.tex`, `papers/assets/*`), do them **one at a time**: open, wait for merge, branch off
  updated `main`. After a merge you can confirm with
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main`.
- Concurrent cloud agents share this remote: **`git fetch` before pushing**, and
  never touch a branch checked out in another worktree.
- Commit/push only when asked. End commit messages with the Co-Authored-By line.

## Paper assets

- **All paper numbers/figures/tables come from `scripts/make_paper_assets.py`**,
  which reads `experiments/results/*.json` and writes `papers/assets/numbers.tex`,
  `papers/assets/figs/*`, `papers/assets/tables/*`. **Never hand-edit
  `papers/assets/numbers.tex`.** The two papers (`papers/world-time-compute/`,
  `papers/framework/`) symlink `figs/tables/numbers.tex/refs.bib/sections` →
  `../assets/`, so the one pipeline is the single source of truth for both.
- A new experiment ENN adds: its results JSON, an entry in `EXPERIMENTS`, a
  `fig_*`/`table_*` function + its call in `main()`, macros before the
  `numbers.tex` write, and a `\NumExperiments` bump (it is a count).
- Regenerate (`python scripts/make_paper_assets.py`) then compile each paper with
  `tectonic main.tex` from its `papers/<name>/` dir (no system latex). Check for
  undefined refs.
- **LaTeX control-sequence names are letters only — no digits** (`\LadderQwenSmall`,
  not `\ScaleQwen7`), or you get "Missing \begin{document}".

## Experiments

- Prefer **deterministic, offline, self-checking** experiments: fixed seeds,
  numpy baselines, `assert` the sign/shape of every claim. **Call `save_results`
  BEFORE the asserts** so a failed check never loses the run.
- Be honest: if a result is weak, flaky, or excluded, say so in the script and the
  paper (e.g. E45 excluded `incr`/`modk` with documented reasons). Don't tune to a
  desired number; fix the design or report the boundary.
- `experiments/common.py` holds shared worlds/helpers (`save_results`,
  `require_ollama`, the sprint world, stats helpers).

## World-model specs, cards & serving

The portable artifact for a world model is a **spec** (`openworld/spec.py`):
`to_spec(world)` → JSON dict, `from_spec(spec, allow_code=False)` → a world,
`validate_spec(spec)` → list of problems (the publish gate). A complete spec
captures **every component of a world model** — keep all of these in sync when you
touch the format:

- `name`, `description`, `card` (`version`/`license`/`authors`/`tags`/`lineage`/`metrics`).
- `state_schema` (inferred type names) + `initial_state` (concrete values).
- `actions`, and `rules` — the declared natural-language contract.
- `transition` by `kind`: `code` (verified `CodeTransition`), `function`
  (`FunctionTransition` via `inspect.getsource`, else `lossy`), `phased`, `llm`,
  `composite`.
- **perception** (the perceive→world boundary): perceptors as `{kind, modality,
  produces, schema}`. `CodePerceptor` carries runnable `code` and round-trips +
  runs server-side with no LLM; Mock/Text/Vision are descriptor-only (not
  reconstructable from a spec).
- **emit** (the world→output boundary): `{modality, fields, report?}`.
- **objectives**: `{name, goal, weight?}`.
- `composite`: `children` (recursive specs), `bridges` (Route adds `on_cross`),
  `aggregators` (fn via `getsource`), `bindings`, `timescales`, `default_actions`,
  `agents`.
- `preview`: a numeric rollout `series` + a bounded state-transition `graph` (BFS
  from the initial state), computed once at serialize time for the card/view.

Rules:

- **Round-trip stays lossless**: `from_spec(to_spec(w), allow_code=True)` must
