# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

The deliverable is the root ESM package, `dsh-provider-qoder`: a DSH extension that lets users access their Qoder subscription.

- `src/` contains the production extension. `adapter.ts` owns provider behavior; `translate.ts`, `serialize.ts`, and `sse.ts` handle protocol conversion and streaming.
- `pi-provider-qoder/` is a temporary reference for the reverse-engineered Qoder authentication, API, signing, model, usage, and streaming behavior.
- `dsh-codex-subscription/` is a temporary reference for DSH plugin integration, OAuth coordination, settings UI, quota reporting, tests, packaging, and diagnostics.

Do not add runtime dependencies on the references or implement production changes inside them. Port needed behavior into the root with tests. Both directories may be deleted after feature parity. Follow their local instructions when running them.

## Architecture Direction

Separate DSH registration, configuration, and credentials from Qoder transport logic. Treat the Pi provider as protocol evidence, not the desired public API; adapt it to the DSH conventions demonstrated by the Codex plugin. Never copy secrets, cached credentials, or generated output.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

The root has no npm scripts and depends on DSH workspace peers; validate it from its host DSH workspace. These reference checks help while porting:

```sh
cd pi-provider-qoder && npm ci
npm run check && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build

cd dsh-codex-subscription && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run check
```

The subscription `check` command runs tests, builds, and verifies its package tarball.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use ESM imports, two spaces, single quotes, and no semicolons. Use `camelCase` for values, `PascalCase` for types/classes, and kebab-case script names. Isolate translation, SSE parsing, credentials, and DSH registration behind testable boundaries.

## Testing Guidelines

Add root tests as `*.test.ts`, colocated with source or under `tests/`. Cover authentication, translation, SSE/tool-call streaming, models, quota, settings, and packaging. Mock network responses by default; do not consume Qoder quota unless explicitly required.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Reference histories use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `chore:`). Keep commits scoped and imperative. PRs must explain implemented Qoder behavior, cite reference evidence, link issues, and list validation commands. Include screenshots for UI changes and flag authentication or compatibility impacts.

## Security & Configuration

Never commit OAuth tokens, API keys, account identifiers, callbacks, or local credential stores. Preserve lockfiles and avoid weakening TLS or silently introducing paid-provider fallbacks.
