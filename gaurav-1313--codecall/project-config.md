# Completion learning check

Before the normal final response for a completed implementation, apply
[`plugins/codecall/skills/codecall/references/trigger-policy.md`](plugins/codecall/skills/codecall/references/trigger-policy.md).
Use task, conversation, and known edited-file evidence; Git is optional. Only
show Start Learning / Skip when the policy outcome is `recommend`. Do not teach
until Start Learning. For `optional` or `skip`, finish normally; `$codecall`
always remains available. Never request an API key or use an external model.
