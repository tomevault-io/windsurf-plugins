## Hard rules

- Secure by default (no public docs/OpenAPI, no wildcard CORS, MCP off until enabled)
- Admin UI only after server validates admin token (`/api/v1/ops/admin.js`)
- No secrets in git
- MCP allow-lists and Admin AI / INKO sandbox (capability + chat tools) are non-negotiable
- Prod: main-CI `squidc5` binary only after PR merge
- Do not help with unauthorized access
