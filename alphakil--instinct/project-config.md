# Instinct — Security Gut Check

Audit anything installed from the internet before trusting it.

## Quick Start

### npm package
```bash
python scripts/npm_audit.py <package-name-or-path>
```
Accepts a global npm package name (e.g., `@tobilu/qmd`) or a direct path to the package directory.

### Python (pip) package
```bash
python scripts/pip_audit.py <package-name-or-path>
```
Accepts an installed package name (e.g., `requests`) or a path to the source directory.

### Everything else (executables, extensions, repos)
Use the manual checklist in `references/checklist.md`. Follow each section relevant to the software type.

## Workflow

1. **Identify type**: npm, pip, executable, browser extension, or git repo
2. **Run automated scan** if npm or pip (use scripts above)
3. **Review findings** — HIGH = block, MEDIUM = review, LOW = note
4. **For non-package software**, follow `references/checklist.md` manually:
   - Check digital signatures and hashes for executables
   - Review permissions for browser extensions
   - Inspect build scripts and hooks for git repos
5. **Report verdict** to user: CLEAN ✅, CAUTION ⚠️, or SUSPICIOUS ❌

## Severity Guide

- **HIGH**: Install hooks with code execution, outbound network calls, credential/wallet access, obfuscated code → do NOT trust without manual review
- **MEDIUM**: Telemetry, env var access, binary files, git URL deps → review but probably fine
- **LOW**: Missing repo field, compiled extensions (.pyd/.so) → informational

## Interpreting Results

Not every finding is malicious. Context matters:
- A web framework legitimately makes HTTP calls
- A CLI tool legitimately uses child_process/spawn
- A compiled extension (.pyd) is normal for performance-critical packages
- `process.env.NODE_ENV` is harmless; `process.env.AWS_SECRET` is not

Read the finding detail and check if the behavior makes sense for what the package does. Flag only what's out of place.

## When Scripts Are Not Enough

For deeper analysis beyond automated scanning:
- Manually read the flagged source files
- Check VirusTotal for executable hashes
- Compare published package against GitHub source (npm pack + diff)
- Search for CVEs or known vulnerabilities
- Check package download trends on npm/PyPI for anomalies
