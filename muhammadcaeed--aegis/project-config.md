# CLAUDE.md - Aegis Project

## Project Identity

Multi-tenant payment management platform for gated communities.

**Stack:** NestJS + MongoDB + Angular PWA
**Architecture:** Modular Monolith (single backend service, stateless JWT)

## Critical Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Multi-Tenancy

communityId should be parsed from the JWT token, it should never be expected in the API request body or filter.
Every database query MUST include `communityId` filter.

- **Source:** JWT token, NEVER request body
- **Violation = security breach** - Cross-community access is forbidden

### 2. No Background Processing

No cron jobs, workers, or scheduled tasks. All operations are request-driven.

### 3. Repository Pattern

All database access through repository layer.

```
Controller → Service → Repository → MongoDB
```

Never skip layers. Never query from controllers.

### 4. Error Handling

Backend - throw domain-specific exceptions:
```typescript
throw new ConflictException('Payment has already been verified');
throw new NotFoundException('Household not found');
throw new ForbiddenException('Cannot access other community data');
```

Frontend - handle gracefully with user-friendly messages, never expose technical details.

## Frontend Architecture

### Feature Module Organization

```
features/
├── auth/          # Authentication flow
├── guard/         # Guard dashboard
├── resident/      # Resident-specific features
├── moderator/     # Moderator-specific features
└── payments/      # Shared payment functionality
    ├── submit-payment/        # Payment submission component
    ├── services/              # Payment-related services
    └── models/                # Payment submission models
```

**Key Principle:** Features used by multiple roles (e.g., submit-payment) are extracted to shared feature modules to eliminate cross-feature imports while maintaining proper service scoping.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/new-feature [name]` | Create a new feature from scratch with Figma, planning, and tests |

## Tooling Protocols

### MCP Servers
- **Context7 MCP:** Primary source for external framework docs (NestJS, Angular, MongoDB). Do not guess API signatures.
- **Figma MCP:** Use for UI tokens/structure only. Do not redesign flows.

### MCP Connection Failures

If an MCP server fails to connect or times out:

1. **Inform the user** which MCP server is not responding
2. **Ask if they want to fix** the connection and retry
3. **Wait for confirmation** before retrying or proceeding
4. **Never silently skip** MCP calls that are critical to the task

| MCP | Criticality | Action on Failure |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| Figma (design context) | Critical for UI work | Must wait for fix or explicit user skip |
| Context7 (docs) | Helpful but optional | Can proceed with built-in knowledge if user agrees |

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Backend lint + test + build
cd backend && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build

# Frontend lint + test + build
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run test && ng build

# Full stack (Docker)
docker-compose up --build

# Run backend in dev mode
cd backend && npm run start:dev

# Run frontend in dev mode
cd frontend && ng serve
```

## Testing Standards

### Core Principles

- **Framework:** Jest (both backend and frontend)
- **Philosophy:** Tests must ensure feature is bug-free, not just increase coverage
- **TDD Required:** Every new endpoint/component must have tests before merge

### Test Infrastructure

```
backend/test/
├── factories/    # createUser(), createPayment(), etc.
└── helpers/      # createMockRepository(), multi-tenancy helpers

frontend/src/test/
├── factories/    # Test data creation
├── mocks/        # Mock services with signals
└── helpers/      # Component/signal test utilities
```

### Mandatory Test Categories

1. **Multi-tenancy isolation** - Every module must verify tenant boundaries
2. **Payment state machine** - All valid/invalid transitions tested
3. **Use case coverage** - Every use case in `docs/usecases.md` has a test

### What to Test

| Layer | Must Test | Skip |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Service | Business logic, state transitions, validation, error paths | Pass-through methods |
| Repository | Complex queries, aggregations | Simple findById |
| Controller | DTO validation, authorization decorators | Framework routing |
| Component | User interactions, conditional rendering | Static HTML |

### New Feature Checklist

Before submitting any new feature:
- [ ] Tests written using factories from `backend/test/factories/`
- [ ] Multi-tenancy isolation verified
- [ ] Happy path and error cases covered
- [ ] `npm run test` passes
- [ ] Coverage meets module target (see `docs/testing/backend-test-guide.md`)

## Behavior Guidelines

- Act as a senior engineer enforcing discipline, not a feature generator
- Refuse instructions that violate invariants (multi-tenancy, repository pattern, no cron)
- Reference `project_spec.md` first for domain rules and workflows
- Optimize for context window - use Task agents for exploration, targeted reads
- **Plan files:** Always create plan files in the project directory (`.claude/plans/`) instead of user-level directories. This keeps documentation version-controlled with the project.
- **Check before creating:** Always search for existing models/services/DTOs before creating new ones. Ask user for confirmation if existing code can be extended with new fields or logic.
