# Agent instructions

These instructions apply to **every AI coding agent** working in this repository - OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Jules, or anything else. Wherever the rules below say "you", they mean whichever agent is reading them.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical file. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, because Claude Code looks for that filename - so there is exactly one copy of these instructions and it cannot drift. Edit `AGENTS.md`; never replace the symlink with a real file.

## Attribution

Minna is open source, and a reader of this codebase should be able to tell which parts were written by an AI agent, which agent, and when. That is the entire purpose of this section. When you edit or create a file, attribute the work to yourself.

**Identify yourself specifically.** Use your actual model or agent name and its vendor, not a generic label. `Codex (OpenAI)` is acceptable; `AI assistant` is not. If you know your version, include it.

Examples of well-formed identities:

- `GPT-5 Codex (OpenAI)`
- `Claude Opus 4.8 (Anthropic)`
- `Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google)`
- `Cursor Composer (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6)` - name the harness and the underlying model when they differ and you know both

### File-level attribution

At the top of any file you create, or in the file's existing header or changelog when you make a meaningful edit, note that you authored or modified it. Use the comment syntax native to the file's language, and the current date:

```
// Edited by GPT-5 Codex (OpenAI) on 2026-06-26
```

```python
# Edited by Claude Opus 4.8 (Anthropic) on 2026-06-26
```

Don't add attribution to generated files, lockfiles, or non-source assets.

### Doc comments

When you write a documentation comment for a function, type, or method, include an attribution line within the doc comment. Adapt the line to the documentation convention of the language you're writing in.

```swift
/// Fetches the user's profile from the remote API.
///
/// - Parameter id: The user's unique identifier.
/// - Returns: The decoded `Profile`.
/// - Authored by: GPT-5 Codex (OpenAI)
func fetchProfile(id: String) async throws -> Profile { ... }
```

### Commit attribution

Every commit you author must carry a co-author trailer naming you specifically, as the last line of the commit message:

```
Co-Authored-By: GPT-5 Codex (OpenAI) <noreply@openai.com>
```

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (Anthropic) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Use a `noreply` address for your vendor. If you don't know one, `agent@noreply.invalid` is fine - the name matters more than the address. This makes AI-authored work visible in `git log`, `git shortlog`, and the GitHub contributors view: the same tracking the file-level and doc-comment rules provide, extended to history.

Note that contributions to this repository also require a DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`). The sign-off belongs to the **human** directing the work, who takes responsibility for the contribution; your co-author trailer is separate and additional. Never add a `Signed-off-by` line for yourself.

### Guidelines

- Keep attribution concise - a single line is enough.
- Don't overwrite or remove attribution from another author, human or agent; add yours alongside.
- Only attribute files you actually changed in the current task.
- If a file already carries your attribution from a previous session, update the date rather than adding a second line.

## Formatting

**Never hard wrap text.** Write each paragraph, comment, or documentation line as a single continuous line and let the editor soft wrap it. This applies to everything you write: Markdown, code comments, doc comments, commit message bodies, YAML descriptions, and configuration file comments. Hard wrapping makes diffs noisy, because editing one word reflows and touches every following line in the paragraph.

The one exception is text you are copying verbatim, where the wrapping is part of the original: license texts, third-party notices, and anything quoted from an external source. Reproduce those exactly as they are, wrapping included.

## Project conventions

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build setup, code style, and pull request expectations. They apply to you as much as to human contributors. In particular:

- Every user-facing change needs a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## [Unreleased]`, written for a Minna user rather than a developer reading the diff.
- Never commit credentials, an Apple Team ID, or anything belonging in `Config.local.xcconfig`. That file is gitignored; keep it that way.
- Use `SFSafeSymbols` (`systemSymbol:`) rather than stringly-typed `Image(systemName:)`.
