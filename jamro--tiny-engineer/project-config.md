# Compile after significant changes

After any significant code change, run `pio run` from the project root and fix failures before considering the work done.

Significant: logic, types, APIs, headers, firmware source (`src/`, `include/`, `lib/`), or `platformio.ini`.

Skip: comments-only, docs-only, or tiny formatting.

Do not flash (`pio run -t upload`) unless asked.
