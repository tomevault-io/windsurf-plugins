# Core properties for parsing and correlation

Organize properties by meaning, not alphabetically.

## routing and correlation keys

`t:clientID`
- TCP client connection identifier
- critical for client-server operation reconstruction

`SessionID`
- assigned session number for the current thread
- critical for session/background reconstruction

`t:connectID`
- infobase connection identifier
- useful for cross-event linking and diagnostics
- Common to many server calls. A single connection handles multiple server call sessions. Cannot uniquely determine the relationship of events.

`p:processName`
- The name of the server context, which is usually the same as the name of the infobase.
- useful as part of correlation key or source partition

`IB`
- infobase name
- important routing and filtering dimension

`Usr`
- infobase user name
- often sparse, but high-value for operation identity

## execution context

`Context`
- execution context
- may include built-in language stack or UI context

`Module` - The name of the called system module (for example, a common module in the 1C configuration)
`Method` - Name of a function or procedure in a module `Module`
`MName` - The name of the remotely invoked method (for SCALL and CALL events).
`IName` - The name of the passed interface whose method is called remotely (for SCALL and CALL events).
`Func` - Name of the action being performed

`Func` property values:
Start - Session start. For SESN events, this marks the beginning of a session and has no duration.
finish - Session finish. For SESN events, this marks the end of a session, and its duration equals the full session lifetime.
Attach - Session assigned to a connection. For SESN events, duration shows how long the session remained assigned to that connection.
Busy - The session is already assigned to another connection. For SESN events, this is emitted when assignment is attempted for a session that is already attached.
Wait - Waiting for session assignment. For SESN events, duration equals the waiting time before the connection gets a session or the assignment is released.
beginTransaction - Transaction start. For SDBL events, this is logged at transaction start and has no duration.
commitTransaction - Transaction commit.
rollbackTransaction - Transaction rollback.
lookupTmpTable - Get or create a temporary database table.
FtextMngrIndexChanges - Full-text index update in file mode.

## DB and query properties

`Sql`
- SQL text

`Rows` - The number of database records retrieved.
`RowsAffected` - The number of modified database records.

`Database`
- database path or server\database identifier

`Dbpid`
- DB-side connection/process identifier


## latency and resource usage

`Duration`
`Durationus`
- duration properties, event-specific

`CpuTime`
- CPU time, especially valuable in CALL

`Memory`
- memory retained during server call

`MemoryPeak`
- peak memory during server call

## locking

`Locks`
- List of managed transaction locks (for TLOCK event).

`WaitConnections`
- Connection `t:connectID` number of the person causing the blocking

`DeadlockConnectionIntersections`
- List of transaction pairs that form a deadlock (for the TDEADLOCK event).

Lock augmentation properties may also appear:
lka='1' - the thread is the lock source.
lkp='1' - the thread is the lock victim.
lkpid - the DBMS request number indicating who blocked whom (only for the lock victim thread). For example, '423'.
lkaid - a list of DBMS request numbers indicating who blocked whom (only for the lock source thread). For example, '271,273,274'.
lksrc - the connection number of the lock source if the thread is the lock victim, for example, '23'.
lkpto - the time in seconds elapsed since the thread was detected as a victim. For example, '15'.
lkato ‑ the time in seconds since the thread was detected as a blocker. For example, ‘21’.

## exceptions

`Descr`
- description text

`Exception`
- exception name

`RetExcp`
- exception passed back as result in CALL error cases

## important guidance

Property names may be missing.
Do not fail if a property is absent.

Property semantics depend on event family.
Do not treat `Method` or `Func` as globally uniform across all events.

For LogT correlation, prioritize:
- `t:clientID`
- `SessionID`
- `p:processName`
- `IB`
- `Usr`
- `Context`
- `CpuTime`
- `Memory`
- `MemoryPeak`
