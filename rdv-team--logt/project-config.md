# Core events for LogT and tech-log parsing

This project focuses on the subset of events most relevant to:
- reconstructing user operations
- reconstructing background operations
- analyzing latency
- diagnosing DB waits, locks, errors, and context

## operation boundary events

`VRSREQUEST`
- request to server for a resource
- natural start boundary for client-server operation reconstruction

`VRSRESPONSE`
- server response
- natural end boundary for client-server operation reconstruction

`SESN`
- session-related actions
- used for session lifecycle and background job reconstruction
- `Func=Start`, `Func=Restore`, `Func=Finish`, `Func=Wait`, `Func=Attach`, etc.

## code execution / remote call events

`CALL`
- incoming remote call on the receiver side
- contains important context and runtime metrics

`SCALL`
- outgoing remote call on the source side

## DB and query events

`DBMSSQL`
`DBPOSTGRS`
- DB-level SQL execution

`SDBL`
- query/model database layer activity

## locking and concurrency

`TLOCK`
- managed transaction locks

`TTIMEOUT`
- lock wait timeout

`TDEADLOCK`
- deadlock detected

## errors and crashes

`EXCP`
- exception / severe error event

`EXCPCNTX`
- exception context, unfinished events at crash/error time

## infra / cluster / connection

`CLSTR`
- cluster operations and cluster state changes

`CONN`
- connection establish / break and ping-related connection diagnostics

`PROC`
- process lifecycle and process-level events

## memory / diagnostics

`MEM`
- memory growth diagnostics if enabled

`LEAKS`
- leak diagnostics if enabled

## event handling guidance

Do not assume all events are present in every environment.
Presence depends on `logcfg.xml` and enabled platform mechanisms.

For LogT:
- `VRSREQUEST`, `VRSRESPONSE`, `SESN`, `CALL` are the most important correlation events
- DB and lock events are supporting evidence inside the reconstructed operation
- `EXCP`, `TTIMEOUT`, `TDEADLOCK` are high-value diagnostics inside the operation timeline
