# react-native-free-canvas

## Stack

- Skia (`@shopify/react-native-skia`) for `Canvas` / `Path` / snapshots.
- Reanimated shared values and worklets; `react-native-gesture-handler` for pan/pinch.
- Use `scheduleOnRN` from `react-native-worklets` when calling React state setters from gesture/worklet code or animated reactions (not `runOnJS`, which is deprecated). See `drawing-canvas.tsx` and `index.tsx`.

## Style (match repo)

- Prettier: single quotes, trailing commas, avoid arrow parens when single arg.
- Prefer `StyleSheet` from `styles.ts` over new inline style objects on hot paths (README calls this out for `flex: 1`).
- Components: `forwardRef` + `memo` for canvas pieces; co-locate prop types in `types.ts` for public API.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- Mark UI-thread callbacks with `'worklet'` where required.

## Architecture

- Do not edit `lib/` — run `yarn build` after changing `src/`.
- Two layers: `DrawingCanvas` (live stroke + gestures) over `DrawnCanvas` (committed paths). Context in `canvas-context.ts`; path completion sync uses `promises-delivery`.

## Types / API

- Extend `FreeCanvasProps` / `FreeCanvasRef` in `types.ts` when adding props or ref methods; export types from `index.tsx` as today.
