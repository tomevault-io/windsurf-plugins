# Error Log
Before debugging any issue, check [`error_log.md`](error_log.md) for known problems and their fixes.

---

# CSS Naming Rules
- **Never** use bare HTML element selectors (`p`, `ul`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `button`, etc.) in `styles.css`.
- **Always** use `df-` prefixed classes. If one doesn't exist for the element you're styling, create it.
- The only exception is `.is-mobile` — this is an Obsidian-injected body class and cannot be renamed.

---

# Versioning
Version format: `milestone.big-features.hotfixes` (e.g. `2.1.10`)
- **milestone** — major redesigns or platform shifts
- **big-features** — new user-facing features
- **hotfixes** — bug fixes and small tweaks

After any change, ask the user whether the version should be bumped and which segment.
Version is set in `manifest.json` and `versions.json`.

# Obsidian Plugin Development Rules

This project follows the architecture, philosophy, and development patterns commonly used in the Obsidian ecosystem.

Always prioritize compatibility, maintainability, simplicity, and predictable behavior.

---

# Core Philosophy

- Follow Obsidian's plugin ecosystem conventions.
- Prefer simple and maintainable implementations.
- Avoid overengineering.
- Reuse existing utilities and abstractions before creating new ones.
- Never duplicate logic.
- Keep plugin behavior predictable and lightweight.
- Respect the user's vault, settings, and performance.
- Do not invent APIs, Obsidian methods, or undocumented behaviors.
- If unsure about an API, verify it from official Obsidian documentation or typings.
- Prefer extending existing plugin architecture instead of bypassing it.

---

# Obsidian Plugin Standards

## Plugin Principles

- Plugins must feel native to Obsidian.
- UI should match Obsidian's design language.
- Minimize intrusive behavior.
- Avoid unnecessary popups, notices, or modal spam.
- Avoid blocking the UI thread.
- Prefer gradual enhancement over aggressive automation.
- Never modify user files unexpectedly.

---

# Technology Stack

- TypeScript only.
- Use Obsidian API directly.
- Use React only if the plugin truly benefits from it.
- Avoid large dependencies whenever possible.
- Keep bundle size small.

# Naming Conventions

## Files

- Components: `PascalCase.ts`
- Views: `SomethingView.ts`
- Modals: `SomethingModal.ts`
- Services: `somethingService.ts`
- Utilities: `something.ts`
- Types: `something.types.ts`

Examples:

- `TaskView.ts`
- `SettingsModal.ts`
- `vaultService.ts`
- `parseFrontmatter.ts`

---

# TypeScript Rules

## Typing

- Never use `any` unless absolutely unavoidable.
- Prefer explicit types.
- Use interfaces for structured data.
- Avoid unsafe casting.

Good:
```ts
interface PluginSettings {
  enabled: boolean;
  apiKey: string;
}
```

Bad:
```ts
const settings: any = {};
```

---

## Safety

- Handle undefined values safely.
- Obsidian vault data should always be treated as potentially missing or malformed.
- Validate frontmatter before using it.
- Never assume files exist.

---

# Obsidian API Usage

## General Rules

- Use official Obsidian APIs only.
- Avoid undocumented internals unless absolutely necessary.
- If using undocumented internals:
  - isolate them
  - document why
  - add safeguards

---

## Vault Operations

- Never overwrite files without clear intent.
- Avoid destructive operations.
- Batch expensive vault operations carefully.
- Debounce filesystem-heavy actions when possible.

Good:
```ts
await app.vault.modify(file, updatedContent);
```

Bad:
```ts
// Repeated writes on every keystroke
```

---

# Performance Rules

## Performance

- Obsidian runs inside Electron.
- Poor plugin performance affects the entire app.
- Avoid excessive DOM manipulation.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Avoid scanning the entire vault repeatedly.
- Cache expensive computations carefully.
- Dispose event listeners properly.

---

## Event Cleanup

Always clean up registered events and intervals.

Good:
```ts
this.registerEvent(
  app.workspace.on("file-open", handleFileOpen)
);
```

Bad:
```ts
app.workspace.on("file-open", handleFileOpen);
```

---

# React Rules (If React Is Used)

- Use functional components only.
- Keep components small and composable.
- Separate logic from UI.
- Avoid excessive global state.
- Reuse components before creating new ones.

---

# UI / UX Standards

## Obsidian UI Consistency

- Follow native Obsidian spacing and patterns.
- Respect dark/light themes.
- Use Obsidian CSS variables.
- Avoid hardcoded colors.
- Avoid custom styling when native styling works.

Good:
```css
color: var(--text-normal);
background-color: var(--background-primary);
```

Bad:
```css
color: #ffffff;
background-color: #000000;
```
