# fiducial — AI hardware design instructions

This file is the entry point. A project that includes this repo (usually as a
submodule at `fiducial/`) imports it from its own `AGENTS.md` with:

```
@fiducial/AGENTS.md
```

## Golden rules

1. **Never guess pinouts, net names, or electrical characteristics.** Verify
   against the datasheet and against the actual files on disk.
2. **Verify after every change.** Run `erc`, `drc`, and the connectivity audit
   (see Tools below). An unverified schematic is a broken schematic.
3. **Read before editing.** KiCad files are S-expressions. Read the relevant
   section, understand it, then make a minimal, targeted edit.
4. **Prefer kicad-cli over hand-editing** for anything it can do (exports,
   reports, BOMs). Hand-edit only what it cannot.

## Tools

All tools are Python 3 stdlib-only. Run them from the project root:

```
python fiducial/scripts/fiducial.py <command>
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `doctor` | Check kicad-cli availability and version |
| `erc <project.kicad_sch>` | Run ERC, summarize JSON report, exit code reflects errors |
| `drc <project.kicad_pcb>` | Run DRC, same behavior. Read-only unless you pass `--save-board` |
| `netlist <project.kicad_sch>` | Export netlist to `<project>-netlist.sexpr` |
| `nets <project.kicad_sch>` | Dump every net with its connected pins |
| `pins <project.kicad_sch> <REF>` | Dump one symbol's pins and their nets |
| `check-intent <project.kicad_sch> intent.csv` | Compare expected connections (`ref,pin,expected_net`) against reality; `--orphans` also flags single-pin nets |
| `lint <project.kicad_sch>` | Structural checks: duplicate refs, missing fields, unconnected pins, single-use labels, dangling nets |
| `check-rules <project.kicad_sch> rules.csv` | Verify house-style rules from CSV (see `docs/rules.md`) |
| `render <project...> --outdir DIR` | Export SVG renders of schematic and/or PCB so you can look at them |
| `bom <project.kicad_sch>` | Export CSV bill of materials |

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` violations found, `2` tool/environment error.
`erc`, `drc`, `check-intent`, `lint`, and `check-rules` accept `--json`
for machine-readable output with the same exit codes.

## Instruction library

Read these when doing the corresponding task — not all up front:

- `skills/schematic/authoring.md` — editing `.kicad_sch` safely (read before any schematic edit)
- `skills/pcb/layout.md` — placement and routing rules (read before PCB work)
- `skills/pcb/drc-workflow.md` — running and fixing DRC violations
- `skills/verification/netlist-audit.md` — proving the schematic matches design intent
- `skills/reference/kicad-cli-cookbook.md` — every useful kicad-cli invocation
- `skills/reference/datasheets.md` — finding and reading datasheets correctly
- `skills/reference/best-practices.md` — power, signal integrity, ESD, DFM, testability checklists
- `skills/reference/terminology.md` — canonical vocabulary; use these terms consistently

## Review skills (standalone)

Load when reviewing a design produced by another agent. Each skill guides a
structured review with interactive prompts and severity-rated findings (error/warning/info).
Use the reviewer orchestrator or run individual check scripts directly.

### Orchestrator

```
python fiducial/scripts/reviewer.py <skill> <project_file> [--json] [--intent intent.csv]
```

| Skill | What it reviews |
|---|---|
| `schematic-correctness` | Intent matching, connectivity, pin assignments |
| `schematic-completeness` | Missing parts, unconnected pins, decoupling |
| `schematic-style` | House style, naming, labeling |
| `power-tree` | Voltage margins, current paths, protection |
| `pcb-layout` | Placement, board outline, clearances |
| `pcb-routing` | Trace widths, via sizing, signal integrity |
| `dfm` | Manufacturing constraints, copper balance |
| `bom` | Part availability, ratings, alternatives |
| `connectivity` | Cross-block connectivity, connector pinouts |
| `documentation` | Title block, annotations, revision history |

### Individual check scripts

```
python fiducial/scripts/schematic_check.py <command> <project.kicad_sch> [--json]
python fiducial/scripts/pcb_check.py <command> <project.kicad_pcb> [--json]
python fiducial/scripts/bom_check.py <command> <project.kicad_sch> [--json]
```

| Script | Commands |
|---|---|
| `schematic_check.py` | `power-pins`, `unconnected`, `orphan-nets`, `refdes-audit`, `label-audit`, `grid-check`, `debris-scan`, `symbol-lookup`, `decoupling-check`, `rail-audit` |
| `pcb_check.py` | `board-stats`, `trace-widths`, `via-audit`, `copper-pours`, `drill-table`, `placement-density`, `board-outline` |
| `bom_check.py` | `parse`, `ratings`, `lifecycle`, `alternates` |

### Skill files

- `skills/review/schematic-correctness.md` — intent matching, connectivity
- `skills/review/schematic-completeness.md` — missing parts, unconnected pins
- `skills/review/schematic-style.md` — house style, naming, labeling
- `skills/review/power-tree.md` — voltage margins, current paths, protection
- `skills/review/pcb-layout.md` — placement, board outline, clearances
- `skills/review/pcb-routing.md` — trace widths, via sizing, signal integrity
- `skills/review/dfm.md` — manufacturing constraints, copper balance
