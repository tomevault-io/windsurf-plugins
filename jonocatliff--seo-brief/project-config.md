# Project Overview

**Single Next.js project. Six versions as pages.** Each version demonstrates one chapter of the SEO workflow.

| Route | Chapter | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/` | — | Landing page, links to all 6 versions |
| `/v1` | Ch 2 | Scaffolded site — Claude Code built it from a one-line prompt |
| `/v2` | Ch 3a | AI blog slop — blog post written without voice files |
| `/v3` | Ch 3b | Voice-injected — same topic, written against `references/` |
| `/v4` | Ch 5 | Landing page — toilet repair service page in voice |
| `/v5` | Ch 6a | On-page SEO — v3 post + FAQ/Breadcrumb/Article/Person schema, TOC, author card, internal links |
| `/v6` | Ch 6b | Technical SEO — v5 + sitemap.xml, robots.txt, OG images, Core Web Vitals |

Site is **Static Site Generation** via `output: 'export'`. Every route pre-rendered to HTML at build time.

# Voice — read before writing any content

When writing **any blog post, service page, or customer-facing copy**, read the files in `./references/`:

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `references/voice.md` | Marco's writing style, sentence rhythm, vocabulary, formatting, anti-patterns |
| `references/humour.md` | How Marco handles humour (dry, industry-aimed, never puns) |
| `references/stats.md` | Canonical real numbers — pricing, response times, jobs, reviews |
| `references/stories.md` | Recurring anecdotes (Windsor garage, fat-in-the-candle, tree roots) |
| `references/opinions.md` | Hot takes on the industry, hot water systems, pricing, older homes |

**Content rules derived from these files:**

- Never use: "unlock", "leverage", "seamless", "world-class", "in today's fast-paced world", exclamation marks, emojis
- Start with the answer; add context after
- Use real numbers from `stats.md`, never round
- One story per post max (from `stories.md`, don't invent new ones)
- One strong opinion per post max (from `opinions.md`, backed by a number)
- Tell people when NOT to hire us — biggest voice tell

Before shipping any writing, re-read `references/voice.md` → "Tells that it's AI-written" and delete anything that matches.

# On-page SEO — for v5+ content

When generating or editing **blog posts for v5 or v6**, read `on-page-seo.md` at the root. Every item applicable to the page type must be satisfied.

Key v5/v6 additions on top of v3:
- FAQ section with FAQPage schema (JSON-LD)
- Breadcrumbs + BreadcrumbList schema
- Author byline + Person schema
- Table of contents with anchor links
- 3–5 internal links, 2–3 external links to authoritative sources
- Open Graph + Twitter Card meta
- Length within 20% of SERP top-3 for the target keyword

---

# Technical SEO — v6 only

v6 adds site-wide technical SEO:
- `app/sitemap.ts` — auto-generated sitemap covering all routes
- `app/robots.ts` — allows all crawlers, points to sitemap
- Canonical URLs on every page (via `metadata.alternates.canonical`)
- Open Graph images (1200×630) — `/public/og/*.png`
- Image width/height attributes for CLS
- Semantic HTML5 (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Static pre-rendering — `output: 'export'`
- Mobile viewport — set in `app/layout.tsx`

---

# Design

Premium, modern, elegant. Subtle animations, proper spacing, clear visual hierarchy. No emoji icons. No generic gradients. One accent colour (indigo).

---

# Development Rules

**Rule 1: Always read first** — before any action, read `CLAUDE.md` and `project_specs.md`.

**Rule 2: Define before you build** — no code before spec approval.

**Rule 3: Look before you create** — check existing files before creating new ones.

**Rule 4: Test before you respond** — run `npm run build` before saying "done".

**Core Rule** — do exactly what is asked. Nothing more, nothing less.

---

# Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Rendering:** Static Site Generation via `output: 'export'`. `out/` is the deployable.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Content:** Flat TypeScript files in `/content/*.ts`. No database.
- **Deployment:** Vercel

**SSG constraints — do NOT break these:**
- No `cookies()`, `headers()`, or `searchParams` in server components
- No `fetch(..., { cache: 'no-store' })` or `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- No runtime API routes
- Dynamic routes (`[slug]`) must implement `generateStaticParams`
- All data fetched at **build time**, not request time

---

# Running the Project

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` — opens on `http://localhost:3000`
3. To ship: `npm run build` → the `out/` directory is the deployable site
