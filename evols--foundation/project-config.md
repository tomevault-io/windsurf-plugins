use suspense whenever possible
tanstack query hooks are in application_frontend/src/hooks/queries

wrap error boundaries in HeadlessBoundary ( application_backend/src/components/reusable/headless_boundary.tsx )
if you need to throw an exception, throw an HeadlessError ( application_frontend/src/components/reusable/headless_error.ts ) because it can be rendered by HeadlessBoundary
