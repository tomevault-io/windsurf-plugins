# AGENTS.md

Repository-wide rules for coding agents; human contributors start with
[CONTRIBUTION.md](CONTRIBUTION.md). Metis is a Python 3.12+ security-review CLI
built around a typed execution graph.

## Working rules

- Read the owning code, callers, focused tests, and routed guide before editing.
  Search for existing contracts and fix shared behavior once at its owner.
- Keep changes focused; do not add speculative abstractions or compatibility
  layers. Preserve published imports, entry points, configuration keys, YAML
  names, ports, and types unless intentionally making a versioned breaking
  change; external callers need not appear in this repository.
- Update the relevant README, guide, and examples in the same change whenever
  user-visible behavior, configuration, CLI, output formats, extension contracts,
  or supported features change. Update this router when an owner moves.
- `MetisEngine` owns composition and lifecycle; stages own typed workflow
  boundaries; nodes own selectable behavior. Generic graph code must not name
  built-in-specific nodes; terminal `result` is a shared graph convention.
- Treat model, tool, extension, repository/file, network, subprocess, SARIF, and
  persisted-data results as untrusted. When adding or changing a boundary,
  validate and bound data before it controls paths, commands, persistence, or
  publication.
- Durable Metis-owned replacement and migration must validate first and preserve
  the prior readable state on failure.
- Use engine-owned scheduling, cancellation, and cleanup for graph work.
  Propagate `concurrent.futures.CancelledError`, use finite network/subprocess
  timeouts, and drain or join owned work before returning.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes. Do not discard, stash, broadly reformat,
  stage, commit, amend, or force-add ignored output unless the user asks.
- Keep tests and examples offline and credential-free. Installed extensions run
  inside the Metis process; installation and selection are trust decisions.
