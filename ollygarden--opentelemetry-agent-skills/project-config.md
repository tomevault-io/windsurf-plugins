# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

A catalog of **Agent Skills** (per the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) spec) for OpenTelemetry, published by OllyGarden. The skills are **non-opinionated and vendor-neutral by design** — there are many valid ways to use OpenTelemetry, so prescribing conventions is out of scope. They exist to give an agent **token-efficient, agent-friendly retrieval**: small fetch tables, lookup indexes, and scripts that point at upstream sources of truth instead of copying docs into context, so answers stay current as OpenTelemetry evolves.

Most changes are to Markdown and YAML files that AI agents consume. The exception is `tools/otel-agent-tools/`, a Go module that generates and validates some of the bundled reference data (see below). "Correctness" means a skill is well-scoped, accurate, points at the maintained source of truth, and is registered in all the right places.

## Preferred workflow

For any change that adds, renames, moves, or removes a skill, or that alters what a skill triggers on or recommends, follow [`docs/preferred-workflow.md`](docs/preferred-workflow.md). Typo and prose fixes go straight to a PR — unless they touch `SKILL.md` frontmatter, since a `description:` edit changes when the skill activates.

## Running the gates locally

The two skill gates are scripts in `bin/`. Both resolve the repository root themselves, so any path spelling works from any working directory — the `./` form below assumes you are at the root:

```bash
./bin/validate-skill.sh            # spec conformance + house rules; a path checks one skill
./bin/check-skill-inventory.py     # skills/, marketplace.json, and README in sync
```

CI enforces one further check that is not a `bin/` script: the `Link Check` workflow. Reproduce it locally with the `lychee` command in [`docs/preferred-workflow.md`](docs/preferred-workflow.md#5-run-the-gates).

`validate-skill.sh` needs `skills-ref`, pinned in `bin/skills-ref.requirement` — that file is the single source CI, Renovate, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` all read, so never paste a revision anywhere else. Install with `uv tool install "$(cat bin/skills-ref.requirement)"`.

## Skill constraints

- The directory name equals the `name:` field — **automated** by `bin/validate-skill.sh` (via `skills-ref`).
- Frontmatter parses as YAML, `description` fits in 1024 characters, no unknown keys — **automated**, same script.
- `SKILL.md` stays under 500 lines — **automated**. Past that, move detail into `references/`.
- Registration across `skills/`, `marketplace.json`, and `README.md` — **automated** by `bin/check-skill-inventory.py`.
- Links resolve — **automated** by the `Link Check` workflow, which scans the whole repository weekly and on every PR.
- Keeping content vendor-neutral, DRY, and token-efficient — **review-enforced**, not automated. A green build says nothing about it.

## Architecture

Each skill is a self-contained directory under `skills/<skill-name>/`:

- `SKILL.md` (required) — YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, optional `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`) followed by the instruction body.
- `references/` (optional) — task-focused docs the SKILL.md links to for detail it doesn't inline (e.g. `otel-go/references/` splits setup, API, instrumentation libraries, performance, breaking changes).
- `components/` (skill-specific) — `otel-collector` uses one directory per Collector component (`README.md` plus `configuration.md`, `advanced.md`, `quirks.md`, `verification.md`) for progressive disclosure.
- `scripts/` (optional) — helper or lookup scripts (e.g. `otel-semantic-conventions` ships a query script).

Two hard rules that are easy to get wrong:

1. **The directory name must equal the `name:` field** in its `SKILL.md` (spec directory rule).
2. Skill `name:` fields are **unprefixed** (`otel-go`, `otel-collector`, …). This is the upstream *facts* package — the companion [`skills`](https://github.com/ollygarden/skills) repo holds OllyGarden's *opinions* under an `ollygarden-` prefix and references these skills for facts. Keep facts here; don't fold opinions in.

## The `tools/otel-agent-tools` Go module

A small Go CLI under `tools/otel-agent-tools/` (wired into the workspace via `go.work`) fetches upstream OpenTelemetry data and renders the generated reference index consumed by `otel-sdk-versions`. CI lints, builds, and tests it, and link-checks the generated index. When changing it:

- `go build ./cmd/otel-agent-tools` and `go test ./...` from `tools/otel-agent-tools/`.
- Generated output (e.g. `skills/otel-sdk-versions/references/generated/otel-version-index.md`) is produced by the tool — regenerate it rather than hand-editing, so it stays consistent and the link check passes.

## Adding or renaming a skill — keep three places in sync

A new skill is only "registered" when it appears in **all** of these. Missing any one is the most common defect:

1. The directory `skills/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md`.
2. The `plugins` array in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`name` + `source: ./skills/<name>` + `description`).
