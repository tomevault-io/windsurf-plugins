Guidance for Claude Code (and humans) working in this repo.

## What this project is

`lc-circuit-breaker` adds **statefulness** to LangChain's `with_fallbacks`. Vanilla LangChain retries the primary model on every request — if the primary is dead and times out at 3s, every call pays 3s before falling through. This library wraps the chain in a distributed circuit breaker so OPEN models are skipped immediately.

## Drop-in API

The only line a consumer changes:

```python
# before
model = primary.with_fallbacks([fallback])

# after
from lc_circuit_breaker import with_stateful_fallbacks
model = with_stateful_fallbacks(primary, [fallback])
```

## Key invariants — do not break these

1. **Redis is the source of truth.** Local snapshots are a 250ms-TTL optimization. Pub/sub is invalidation, not state. If you find yourself trusting a local snapshot for a transition decision, you're doing it wrong.
2. **All state transitions are atomic Lua scripts.** Never do read-modify-write in Python against Redis. New transitions belong in `store/lua/`.
3. **The probe lock is what prevents thundering herd.** Only one pod across the cluster issues the HALF_OPEN probe per cooldown cycle. If you change probe semantics, re-read §8 of `PLAN.html`.
4. **Time is read from the store, not from each pod's clock.** Lua uses `ARGV[now_ms]` passed by Python, but cooldown comparisons happen *inside* Lua so they're consistent. Don't compare local `time.time()` against `opened_at_ms` outside Lua.
5. **Hash-tagged keys.** All per-identity Redis keys use `cb:{ns}:{identity}:...` (the `{identity}` is a Redis Cluster hash tag). All keys touched by one Lua script must share the same tag.
6. **`PASSTHROUGH_KINDS` never trip the breaker and never fall through.** BAD_REQUEST, CONTENT_FILTERED, CANCELLED bubble straight to the caller. The classifier is the only place this distinction is made.

## Configuration

All knobs live in `CircuitConfig` (see [config.py](src/lc_circuit_breaker/config.py)). Every field has a matching `LCCB_*` env var. Explicit kwargs > env > defaults. Validation runs in `__post_init__`.

Defaults: 5 failures in 30s trip → 20s cooldown → 1 probe → close. Exponential backoff capped at `max_cooldown_seconds`.

## Confirmed product decisions

These were decided up-front; revisit only with the user:

- **429s count toward the breaker** (RATE_LIMITED is in `COUNTING_KINDS`).
- **The probe uses the real user request**, not a synthetic prompt.
- **All circuits open ⇒ raise `AllCircuitsOpen`**, not a sentinel return.
- **Ops surface is the `lccb` CLI** (`lccb status / open / close / reset / watch`). No HTTP admin endpoint.
- **No observability layer in v1.** Metrics/tracing are out of scope. Add `log.info/debug` only — don't introduce a metrics dependency.

## Adding a state transition

If you need a new transition (e.g. a fourth state, or a different close condition):

1. Edit the relevant Lua script in `store/lua/` — keep the operation atomic.
2. Mirror the logic in `store/memory.py` so single-process tests still cover it.
3. Update `State` / `Snapshot` if new fields are needed.
4. Add a test in `tests/test_breaker.py` that runs against `InMemoryStateStore`.
5. If you change the Lua return shape, update `RedisStateStore._parse_snapshot` / `_parse_decide`.

## Adding a new error type

1. Edit `classifier.py`. Match by exception class name first (it works across SDK versions and avoids importing optional deps), then status code as fallback.
2. Decide: counts toward breaker (add to `COUNTING_KINDS`) or passthrough (`PASSTHROUGH_KINDS`).
3. Add a case in `tests/test_classifier.py`.

## Running tests

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'
.venv/bin/pytest tests/
```

The default suite uses `InMemoryStateStore` only — no Redis required. A future integration suite against real Redis should go in `tests/integration/` with a `redis` marker.
