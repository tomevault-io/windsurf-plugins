## Dev environment tips

Run ./utils/clang-format.ps1 after making changes to C++ files, to ensure that the changes are correctly formatted.

## Canonical repository and remotes

The canonical working tree is on the macOS host:

```text
/Users/salimtrouve/Documents/GitHub/mtasa-neon
```

Make, review, commit, and push all source changes from this working tree. Its remotes are:

```text
origin   https://github.com/Dryxio/mtasa-neon.git
upstream https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue.git
```

The same working tree is visible inside the Parallels VM at:

```text
C:\Mac\Home\Documents\GitHub\mtasa-neon
```

Do not build directly on the Parallels shared folder. It is slower than the VM-local disk and has caused inconsistent file access. Do not make source changes only in the VM build copy because it has no Git metadata and those changes will not be versioned.

## Windows VM build workflow

The Parallels VM is named `Windows 11`. The VM-local source/build copy is:

```text
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom
```

Use this workflow:

1. Modify the canonical `mtasa-neon` working tree on macOS.
2. Synchronize it from `C:\Mac\Home\Documents\GitHub\mtasa-neon` to `C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom`, preserving the VM-local `Build` and `Bin` directories and excluding `.git`.
3. Regenerate Visual Studio projects when build definitions, dependencies, or source-file lists change.
4. Build the client as `Release|Win32` and the server as `Release|x64`.
5. Test the produced binaries in the VM.
6. Commit and push from the canonical macOS working tree only.

The generated solution is:

```text
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Build\MTASA.sln
```

The installed Visual Studio/MSBuild toolchain is under:

```text
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community
```

The DirectX SDK June 2010 is installed in the VM.

## Client build and runtime paths

Build the client with `Release|Win32`. Important outputs are:

```text
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\Multi Theft Auto.exe
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\MTA\core.dll
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\MTA\netc.dll
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\mods\deathmatch\client.dll
```

The current CUSTOM `netc.dll` works in the Parallels VM. Keep it paired with the current source ABI; do not replace it with the old MTA 1.6 module.

### Launching the graphical client from macOS

GUI applications must be started in the logged-in Windows desktop session. Always pass `--current-user` to `prlctl exec`; without it, `cmd.exe` or PowerShell can return success while no visible MTA process is created.

Launch the custom client and connect directly to the local server with:

```sh
prlctl exec "Windows 11" --current-user powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command \
  "Start-Process -FilePath 'C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\Multi Theft Auto.exe' -ArgumentList 'mtasa://127.0.0.1:22003' -WorkingDirectory 'C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin'"
```

The equivalent `cmd.exe` form is:

```sh
prlctl exec "Windows 11" --current-user cmd.exe /c start "" \
  "C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\Multi Theft Auto.exe" \
  "mtasa://127.0.0.1:22003"
```

## Server build and runtime paths

Build the current Windows server with `Release|x64`. Building the solution as `Release|Win32` excludes the server launcher, core, and deathmatch projects. Important x64 outputs are:

```text
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\MTA Server64.exe
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\x64\core.dll
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\x64\net.dll
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\x64\deathmatch.dll
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\x64\lua5.1.dll
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\x64\xmll.dll
```

Server configuration and resources are stored at:

```text
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\mods\deathmatch\mtaserver.conf
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\mods\deathmatch\acl.xml
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server\mods\deathmatch\resources
```

Run the server from `C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom\Bin\server` so its relative paths resolve correctly. The default tested endpoints are:

```text
22003/UDP  game server
22005/TCP  HTTP resource server
```

`win-install-data.bat` installs shared client/server data. Answer yes to its resources prompt, or otherwise ensure the resources directory above is installed before testing the server.

## GTA: San Andreas test paths

The reliable VM-local GTA copy used for testing is:

```text
C:\dev\GTA-SA
```

The host copy and its Parallels shared path are:

```text
/Users/salimtrouve/Documents/GTA-SanAndreas
C:\Mac\Home\Documents\GTA-SanAndreas
```

Prefer `C:\dev\GTA-SA` for runtime tests. Loading GTA directly from the shared Mac path previously produced false missing-file errors even when Windows command-line tools could see the files.

## Reference installations

Keep the official/older installations isolated from the custom build:

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\MTA San Andreas 1.6
C:\Program Files (x86)\MTA San Andreas 1.7
C:\dev\mtasa-vm-custom
```

The MTA 1.6 `netc.dll` uses an older client net module ABI and is not a drop-in replacement for current source builds.

## Verification expectations

After relevant changes, verify the smallest applicable set of the following:

- The requested configuration compiles successfully.
- The client reaches GTA and can connect to the local custom server.
