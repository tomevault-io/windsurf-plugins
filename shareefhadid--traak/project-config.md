# Data Storage

The application uses Isar as its local database solution.

## Service Configuration
- [lib/services/isar_service.dart](mdc:lib/services/isar_service.dart) - Contains the Isar database initialization and management logic

## Data Flow
1. The database is initialized in [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart)
2. Feature repositories (like [lib/features/track/repositories/routine_repository.dart](mdc:lib/features/track/repositories/routine_repository.dart)) interact with the database through the IsarService
3. Models are used to represent the data schema and are typically stored in the `models` directory of each feature

## Working with Data
- When adding a new data model, make sure to update the IsarService
- Repositories should handle all database operations
- Use the repository pattern to abstract database operations from the UI layer
