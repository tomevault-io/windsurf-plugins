# Primer agent guide

Primer has completed Phases 1 through 7, the external-connector readiness gate, and a scoped Level 2 query-planning enhancement. Development is paused for manual live testing under `docs/manual-live-testing.md`; do not begin Phase 8 or add live connectors without a new explicit direction. The complete CLI pipeline, local HTTP API, account/content operations, streamed grounded chat, evidence navigation, account-scoped retrieval inspection, evaluation reporting, `primer.connector.v1`, atomic synchronization, diagnostics, backup, readiness gates, and bounded answer-query planning are implemented. The product continues to use only local fixture data. The `acme-v0.1` full and later targeted live runs are preserved; `acme-v0.3` is the active verified fixture. Browser code must not access SQLite or provider credentials, and chat must derive its actor only from the active server session. Primer does not index source-code bodies; Helix/Pi owns real repository exploration.

This file is an entrypoint, not the full specification.

## Related projects

| Project | Local path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Primer | `~/Desktop/acme/primer` | Knowledge product and fictional Acme evidence corpus; outside the Issues → Helix runtime loop. |
| Acme Identity | `~/Desktop/acme/acme-identity` | Optional suite principal provider; Primer still owns actor mappings and knowledge ACLs. |
| Prelude | `~/Desktop/acme/prelude` | Project inception drafting; may query Primer over HTTP and export Helix bootstrap artifacts. |
| Helix | `~/Desktop/acme/helix` | Agent workflow control plane that receives work and orchestrates changes. |
| Acme Issues | `~/Desktop/acme/acme-issues` | Local issue tracker and webhook harness that triggers Helix and receives callbacks. |
| Acme Projects | `~/Desktop/acme/acme-projects` | Feature-idea and collaboration board for existing Helix repos; can manually create non-triggering issues through Acme Issues. |
| Acme Todo | `~/Desktop/acme/acme-todo` | Disposable target application used for agent implementation and verification. |

Existing-repo runtime flow: Acme Issues → Helix → Acme Todo, followed by a Helix completion callback to Acme Issues. Primer remains outside that path while its CLI and web product are built. Later, Acme Issues may be a read-only authoritative source for Primer, and Helix may consume bounded Primer evidence through a stable query boundary.

Intended feature flow for existing repos begins in Acme Projects, which requests a linked implementation issue from Acme Issues; Acme Issues alone triggers Helix. New-project inception belongs to Prelude, which may query Primer over HTTP and exports bootstrap artifacts for Helix empty-workspace bootstrap.

## Read first

1. [`README.md`](./README.md) for project status and document routing.
2. [`modern-knowledge-base.md`](./modern-knowledge-base.md) for the original concept.
3. [`docs/vision.md`](./docs/vision.md) and [`docs/product-spec.md`](./docs/product-spec.md) before changing product scope.
4. [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) before choosing infrastructure, models, connectors, data stores, or service boundaries.
5. [`docs/evaluation.md`](./docs/evaluation.md) before claiming a retrieval or answer-quality improvement.
6. [`docs/decisions.md`](./docs/decisions.md) before turning an assumption into a durable choice.

## Invariants

- Primer is a focused knowledge product whose first release proves a complete, trustworthy evidence pipeline before expanding its operational breadth.
- Original systems are authoritative; the search index is derived and rebuildable.
- Different source types retain source-aware processing and provenance.
- Authorization filtering happens before evidence reaches a model.
- Suite permissions and knowledge access are separate: Identity gates Primer operations, while a mapped Primer actor and Primer-owned groups gate evidence.
- Query planning may vary search text only. It cannot choose the actor, groups, project scope, ACL filters, evidence, or answer; every planned query runs against the same pre-authorized population.
- Retrieval remains inspectable from candidates through final evidence.
- Generated claims must link to supporting evidence or state uncertainty.
- Exact search and semantic search are complementary; neither is treated as truth.
- Domain rules, source authority, freshness, and supersession remain explicit.
- MCP and live third-party integrations are optional boundaries, not MVP foundations.
- The CLI is the first product surface and owns no duplicate business logic; the later API and web UI reuse the same application services.
