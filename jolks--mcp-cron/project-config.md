# CLAUDE.md

Go MCP server for cron task scheduling (shell commands and AI prompts).

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...                # build all packages
go test ./...                 # run all tests
go test ./... -cover          # run tests with coverage
go tool golangci-lint run     # lint (installed as go tool dependency in go.mod)
go test ./internal/server/ -run TestIntegration -v  # integration tests only
MCP_CRON_ENABLE_OPENAI_TESTS=true go test ./...     # include AI integration tests (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
MCP_CRON_ENABLE_ANTHROPIC_TESTS=true go test ./...  # include AI integration tests (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

## Project Structure

```
cmd/mcp-cron/          # Entry point — flag parsing, wiring, graceful shutdown
internal/
  agent/               # AI task executor (multi-provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible) + MCP tool loop
  command/             # Shell command executor (exec.CommandContext with timeout)
  config/              # Config structs, defaults, env var loading, validation
  errors/              # Typed errors: NotFound, AlreadyExists, InvalidInput, Internal
  logging/             # Leveled logger (Debug/Info/Warn/Error/Fatal), file + stdout
  model/               # Core types: Task, Result, TaskType, TaskStatus, Executor, ResultStore interfaces
  scheduler/           # Poll-based DB scheduler (robfig/cron parser only), optimistic locking for multi-instance dedup
  server/              # MCP server, tool registration, HTTP/stdio transport, handlers
  singleton/           # File-lock-based singleton per db-path (primary/secondary instance selection)
  sleep/               # Platform-specific system sleep prevention (macOS, Windows)
  store/               # SQLite store (persistent task definitions + result history, schema migrations)
npm/
  mcp-cron/            # Main npm package — JS wrapper that spawns the platform binary
  mcp-cron-{os}-{arch}/ # Platform-specific packages (darwin/linux/windows × amd64/arm64)
scripts/
  build-npm.sh         # Cross-compile Go binaries for all platforms, optional version update
  publish-npm.sh       # Publish all 7 npm packages (platform packages first, then main)
```

## Key Conventions

- **Versioning**: `config.Version` defaults to `"dev"` and is injected at build time via `-ldflags "-X github.com/jolks/mcp-cron/internal/config.Version=X.Y.Z"`. The build script and CI handle this automatically from the git tag — never hardcode a version in source.
- **Vendor directory**: `vendor/` is gitignored — do NOT commit it. Dependencies are tracked via `go.mod` + `go.sum`; run `go mod vendor` locally to recreate.
- **License header**: Every Go file starts with `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only`
- **Handler signature**: `func (s *MCPServer) handle<Name>(_ context.Context, request *mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error)`
- **Task types**: `shell_command` (runs a command) and `AI` (runs an LLM prompt)
- **Task statuses**: pending, running, completed, failed, disabled
- **Storage**: In-memory read cache refreshed from SQLite on each poll tick; SQLite is the source of truth for task definitions and result history (`modernc.org/sqlite`, pure Go)
- **Scheduling**: Poll-based — `next_run` column in `tasks` table, polled every `PollInterval` (default 1s). Optimistic locking (`UPDATE ... WHERE next_run = :current`) prevents duplicate execution across multiple instances sharing the same DB. Tasks can be **scheduled** (with a cron expression) or **on-demand** (no schedule, triggered via `run_task`).
- **Responses API vs Chat Completions** (OpenAI provider): The Responses API is only used when talking directly to OpenAI (`api.openai.com`), Azure OpenAI (`*.openai.azure.com`), or with no custom base URL. All other base URLs default to Chat Completions, which is universally supported by third-party proxies (LiteLLM, Ollama, vLLM, Groq, etc.). `IsResponsesAPICapable()` in `config/config.go` controls this via exact hostname matching and suffix matching. The host lists are unexported — all access goes through the function.
- **AI task system message**: AI tasks receive a short system message (~450 chars) with their task ID, `get_task_result` usage instructions, and MCP namespace prefix mapping. Tool definitions are NOT listed (models get those via the API).
- **Graceful shutdown**: Scheduler tracks in-flight task goroutines with a `sync.WaitGroup`; `Stop()` blocks until all running tasks complete and persist results. Shutdown timeout is derived from `DefaultTimeout + 1 minute`. Result store is closed last in `app.Stop()`, after scheduler and server.
- **Singleton per db-path**: A file lock (`gofrs/flock`) on `<db-path>.lock` determines the **primary** instance. The first instance to acquire the lock is primary and enters keep-alive mode after transport exit (scheduler continues running). Subsequent instances on the same db-path are **secondary** — they serve their MCP request and exit when the transport closes. This prevents N lingering processes when MCP clients spawn mcp-cron per request.
