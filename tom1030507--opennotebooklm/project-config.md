# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`backend/app/` is the FastAPI application: HTTP routes in `routers/`, business
logic in `services/`, source importers in `adapters/`, SQLAlchemy models and
column types in `db/`, shared helpers in `utils/`. Keep routers thin — they
validate, delegate to a service, and shape the response.

`backend/scripts/` holds operational scripts, run as `python -m scripts.<name>`
from `/app`. `backend/tests/` has API and lifecycle tests, `backend/tests/unit/`
focused ones, and `backend/tests/eval/` the retrieval evaluation dataset.

`frontend/` is a Next.js app: routes in `app/`, reusable UI in `components/`,
hooks in `hooks/`, Zustand stores in `store/`, API client and session handling in
`lib/`.

Deployment lives in `deploy/` and the root `docker-compose.yml`.

Two traps in the layout:

- The **root-level `app/`** (`app/adapters/sqlite_vec.py`, `app/services/monitoring.py`,
  `app/routers/monitoring.py`) is orphaned. Nothing imports it, and
  `sqlite_vec.py` does not use sqlite-vec despite the name. Do not extend it;
  the live code is under `backend/app/`.
- **`docs/` is gitignored.** Anything you want tracked belongs in `README.md` or
  in a module docstring, not in `docs/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `docker compose up -d --build` runs the stack: backend on `:8000`, frontend on
  `:3000`. Optional services via `--profile with-ollama` or `--profile with-cache`.
- `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt` then
  `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload` runs the API outside Docker.
- `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev` starts Next.js. `npm run build` for a
  production build, `npm run lint` for ESLint.
- `docker exec <backend-container> sh -lc "cd /app && python -m pytest tests -q"`
  runs the backend suite.
- `cd frontend && npm test` runs vitest.

**The backend suite needs the ML dependencies importable.** `app.services.embeddings`
imports `sentence_transformers` and `torch` at module scope, so a bare virtualenv
cannot even collect the tests — in practice the container is the place to run
them. `backend/tests/unit/test_config.py` additionally walks up to the repo root
for the `.env.example` files, so run it with the repo root available, not just
`backend/` mounted.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Four-space indentation and PEP 8 for Python: `snake_case` functions and modules,
`PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants. Every public function gets a
docstring with `Args:` and `Returns:`.

Comment the *why*, not the *what*, and say what would go wrong otherwise — the
codebase leans on this, e.g. `meta_json` must be reassigned rather than mutated
because SQLAlchemy cannot see an in-place change to a JSON column, and that is
recorded where it matters. Do not leave a comment that only restates the code.

TypeScript follows the existing two-space, semicolon, single-quote style. React
components are `PascalCase.tsx`; hooks and stores read as `useMediaQuery`,
`useStore`.

Schema changes: `Base.metadata.create_all` creates missing *tables* and nothing
else, so a column added to a model never reaches a database that already exists —
the app starts and then fails on "no such column". Add the column to
`ADDED_COLUMNS` in `app/db/database.py` as well; it is applied idempotently on
start-up. There is no migration tool wired up (alembic is in requirements but
unused).

Timestamps: new datetimes come from `app.utils.time.utc_now`, never
`datetime.now()` or `datetime.utcnow()`, and stored datetime columns use
`UTCDateTime` so everything the API emits carries a UTC designator. Where
ordering matters, prefer a Python-side default over `func.now()` — SQLite's
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` has second resolution, and tied timestamps make `order_by`
arbitrary.

## Testing Guidelines

Pytest for the backend. Name files `test_*.py`, functions `test_<behavior>`. Add
unit tests for service logic and API tests for route or persistence changes.
`backend/pytest.ini` registers the markers; `backend/tests/conftest.py` provides
the auth fixtures (`authenticated_client`, `authorize`, `auth_headers`,
`seed_user`) — use them rather than rolling your own token.

Every data-bearing route sits behind `get_current_user`, so a new route is
authenticated by default and a test that forgets a token gets `401`.

**Authenticated is not authorized.** Knowing who is calling does not say whether
the row is theirs, and a route that only holds the token check will happily serve
another account's project by id. Resolve ids through
`app/routers/ownership.py` — `require_project`, `require_document`,
`require_conversation` — and scope listings with `visible_projects` /
`owned_document_ids`. Those helpers answer `404` for someone else's row, matching
the answer for one that does not exist, so an id cannot be probed for existence.
`tests/test_user_isolation.py` covers the pairing for every route; extend it when
adding one.

Note that some route tests replace `sys.modules["app.services.rag"]` with a stub
so importing the query router does not load the embedding model. That replacement
outlives the module that made it, so a test needing the real `app.services.rag`
must ask for it explicitly.

Retrieval changes should be measured, not asserted:
