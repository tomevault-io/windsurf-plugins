# AGENTS.md

## Project Rules

- This repo IS the chief-agent framework. Source of truth is `template/`.
- Product changes (agent definitions, skills, AGENTS.md content, .chief/ scaffolding) → MUST edit `template/` first, then sync to root.
- Dogfooding-only changes (milestone plans, todos, reports) → edit root `.chief/` directly.
- NEVER let root and template drift without explicit reason.

---

## Rules Hierarchy

1. **Project Rules** above (highest authority)
2. `.chief/_rules`
3. `.chief/milestone-X/_goal` (lowest authority)

If rules conflict, higher priority wins. Always.

Each milestone is self-contained. Only the active milestone's goals/contracts + global `.chief/_rules/` apply. Previous milestone artifacts are not inherited. To carry forward a decision from a past milestone, promote it to `.chief/_rules/`.

---

## User Interaction Rules

- When asking the user a question, use ask_user with ONE short question only.
- When presenting a recap, summary, or review:
  1. Print it as formatted text first (numbered list, table, or markdown block).
  2. Then ask_user ONCE with a short confirmation, e.g. "Proceed?" or "Any changes?"
  3. NEVER put recap content inside ask_user.
- Do NOT ask multiple questions in a row. Make a recommendation, summarize, then confirm once.

## Agent Behavior Principles

### 1. Think Before Acting

- Start with the smallest plausible interpretation of the request.
- If uncertain, ask ONE clarifying question — don't assume the big interpretation.
- Surface tradeoffs and push back when a simpler approach exists.
- When confused, name what's unclear and stop. Don't hide confusion behind a plan.

### 2. Simplicity First

- Do the minimum that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- If a task can be done in 1-3 commands, do it directly. Don't delegate trivial work to builder-agent.
- No features, abstractions, or error handling beyond what was asked.
- If a plan starts needing an options table, pause — you may not have understood the question.

### 3. Surgical Changes

- Touch only what the request requires. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken. Match existing style.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.
- Clean up only what YOUR changes made unused. Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

- Transform vague requests into verifiable goals before starting.
- Define what "done" looks like. Loop until verified.
- For multi-step work, state a brief plan with verification at each step.
- Strong success criteria let agents work independently. Weak criteria require constant clarification.

## Chief Agent Framework

### Human Responsibilities

- Write and refine this file
- Maintain `.chief/_rules`
- Define milestone goals

### AI Responsibilities

- Follow this file strictly
- Follow `.chief/_rules`
- Follow milestone goals and contracts
- Ask for clarification only when multiple valid paths exist

### Directory Structure

```
.chief/
├── _rules/
│   ├── _standard/       # Coding standards, architecture constraints
│   ├── _contract/       # Data models, API contracts, schemas
│   ├── _goal/           # High-level goals (shared across milestones)
│   └── _verification/   # Test commands, build requirements, definition of done
├── _template/           # Scaffold for new milestones
└── milestone-X/
    ├── _goal/           # Milestone-specific goals
    ├── _contract/       # Milestone-specific contracts

    └── _report/         # Reports, investigations, task outputs
```

### 3-Agent Architecture

| Agent | Role | Does | Does NOT |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| **Chief** | Planner/Orchestrator | Plan, delegate, decide, update todo | Implement code |
| **Builder** | Implementer | Code, unit test, type/lint fix, commit | Integration test, architecture decisions |
| **Tester** | Verifier | Integration/UI/API/environment testing | Implement code, patch bugs |

### Responsibility Boundary

- **Builder** handles ALL fast, deterministic, local verification: unit tests, type checks, lint, build. Builder MUST run these before committing.
- **Tester** handles ONLY slow, non-deterministic, real-world verification: integration tests, UI flows, API calls, auth flows, environment-dependent checks.
- Tester NEVER runs unit tests, lint, build, or reads source files for code review.
- Tester is ONLY triggered when the user explicitly requests it. Chief MUST NOT auto-delegate to tester.

### Execution Cycle

```
Human defines direction → Chief plans → Builder builds → Chief decides → Repeat
```

Tester is injected into the cycle only when the user requests real-world validation.

### Rules for `.chief/_rules` Files

- MUST be concise, structural, clear
- MUST eliminate ambiguity
- Include small code examples when useful
- Anything unclear may lead to incorrect autonomous decisions

### Optional: Review-Plan-Agent

Reviews plans for internal consistency. Catches contradictions and scope leaks. Does not modify plans — reports issues only. Defined in `.agents/agents/review-plan-agent.md`.

## Project Configuration

Project-specific details (dev commands, tech stack, architecture) are defined in `.chief/project.md`.
