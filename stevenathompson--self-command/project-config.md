# Self Command Extension

This extension provides tools that allow the Gemini CLI agent to control its own interface via tmux, wait for tasks, monitor files, and manage the workspace.

## Tools

### 1. self_command

Executes a Gemini CLI command programmatically.

#### Usage
Use this tool when you need to execute a Gemini CLI command, such as running a specific /command, listing files, or triggering other agent actions.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
self_command({
  command: string; // The command to send to Gemini (e.g., "/compress", "/help").
});
```

**Response**
Returns a text message confirming the task has started, including a unique **Request ID** (e.g., `[A1B2]`). This ID will also appear in the completion notification.

**Example**
```javascript
// To ask for help
self_command({ command: "/help" });
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**
**You MUST yield your turn immediately after calling this tool.** Do not attempt to perform other actions.

---

### 2. gemini_sleep

Sleeps for a specified duration and then sends a wake-up notification.

#### Usage
Use this tool to pause execution while waiting for a task that you know will take a specific amount of time.

**Single Active Sleep Policy:**
Only ONE sleep task can be active at a time. If you request a new sleep while one is already running, the system will **choose the shorter duration**:
- If the new sleep ends *sooner* than the current one, the current sleep is cancelled and replaced by the new, shorter one.
- If the new sleep ends *later*, the request is ignored, and the existing shorter sleep continues.

**Recurring Sleep:**
You can set `recurring: true` to be woken up periodically (e.g., for monitoring).
- **Constraint:** Recurring sleep requires a minimum interval of **3600 seconds (1 hour)**.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
gemini_sleep({
  seconds: number; // Number of seconds to sleep (or interval if recurring).
  recurring?: boolean; // Optional: If true, wakes repeatedly. Min 3600s.
});
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**
**You MUST yield your turn immediately after calling this tool.**

---

### 3. watch_log

Monitors a file and wakes the system up when it changes or matches a specific pattern.

#### Usage
Use this tool to wait for a specific event in a log file.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
watch_log({
  file_path: string; // Absolute path to the log file to watch.
  regex?: string; // Optional regex pattern to match against new log content.
  wake_on_change?: boolean; // If true (and no regex), wakes on any file change.
  timeout_sec?: number; // Optional: Maximum time in seconds to watch. Defaults to 3600.
});
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**
**You MUST yield your turn immediately after calling this tool.**

---

### 4. cancel_watch

Cancels active log watchers.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
cancel_watch({
  file_path?: string; // Optional: The file path to stop watching. If omitted, cancels ALL watchers.
});
```

---

### 5. yield_turn

Explicitly ends the turn immediately.

#### Usage
**CRITICAL: DO NOT ABUSE THIS TOOL.** 
Use this tool **ONLY** when you have triggered a long-running background task that *explicitly instructs you to yield* (like `self_command`, `run_long_command`, `gemini_sleep`, or `watch_log`) and you need to wait for its completion notification.

**BANNED USAGES:**
- Do **NOT** use this tool just because you are "reading logs" or need a moment to think.
- Do **NOT** use this tool to "take a nap" or pause arbitrarily.
- Do **NOT** use this tool after running standard, synchronous tools (like `run_shell_command`, `read_file`, etc.).

Use it **ONLY** when the documentation of another tool explicitly says "**You MUST yield your turn immediately after calling this tool.**" If a tool does not say that, do not yield.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
yield_turn({});
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**
**You MUST NOT call any other tools in the same turn as `yield_turn`.**

---

### 6. run_long_command

Executes a long-running shell command in the background and notifies Gemini when finished.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
run_long_command({
  command: string; // The shell command to execute.
});
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**
**You MUST yield your turn immediately after calling this tool.**

---

### 7. send_keys

Sends keystrokes to a specific tmux pane.

#### Usage
Use this tool to interact with TUI applications, answer interactive prompts (y/n), or send control signals like `C-c`.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
send_keys({
  keys: string; // Keys to send. E.g., "y", "Enter", "C-c".
  pane_id?: string; // Target pane ID (e.g. "%1"). Defaults to main pane if omitted.
});
```

**Example**
```javascript
send_keys({ keys: "y", pane_id: "%2" });
send_keys({ keys: "Enter", pane_id: "%2" });
```

---

### 8. capture_pane

Captures the visible text content of a tmux pane.

#### Usage
Use this tool to "see" what is happening in a pane, especially for checking the status of TUI apps or interactive commands.

**Tool Signature**
```typescript
capture_pane({
  pane_id?: string; // Target pane ID. Defaults to main pane.
  lines?: number; // Optional: Number of lines to capture from bottom.
});
```

---

### 9. create_pane
