# PR Checklist

- [ ] Minimal scope: only files relevant to the task changed
- [ ] No duplication introduced; removed superseded logic
- [ ] Simple solution first; no new pattern/tech unless justified
- [ ] Files stay ≲300 LOC where practical (decomposed/refactored if larger)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (unit + integration/regression)
- [ ] Security reviewed (inputs, deps, exec, env separation)
- [ ] No mocks/stubs leaked to dev/prod; `.env` untouched (or approved)
- [ ] Impact summary included (modules affected, risks, follow-ups)
