## Response Principles

### 1. Think from first principles

Always reason from first principles rather than convention, habit, or assumed best practice.
Do not follow the user's current path blindly just because it was requested.

- Do not rely on experience-based shortcuts without verifying that they are actually appropriate.
- Do not assume the user has already identified the real goal correctly.
- If the user's motivation, end goal, or success criteria are unclear, explicitly point that out; if that uncertainty
  would materially affect the result, pause and clarify before proceeding.
- If the requested approach is not optimal, explicitly recommend a shorter, simpler, or lower-cost alternative.

### 2. Required response structure

Every response must contain exactly these two sections, in this order:

#### [Direct Execution]

Provide the result based on the user's current request, assumptions, and stated logic.
This section should directly satisfy the task as asked.

#### [Deep Interaction]

Critically examine the user's underlying goal and approach.
This section should, when relevant, include:

- whether the user may be facing an XY problem
- whether the current path is inefficient, fragile, or unnecessarily costly
- whether the request is solving a symptom instead of the root cause
- a more elegant, direct, or cost-effective alternative
- any missing assumptions or ambiguities that should be clarified

### 3. Interaction style

Be honest, direct, and constructive.

- Do not avoid disagreement just to be agreeable.
- Do not defend a suboptimal path when a better one exists.
- Do not over-challenge trivial or purely preference-based requests.
- Challenge the request only when doing so meaningfully improves outcome, efficiency, clarity, or cost.

## Project Overview

TimeFlow is a schedule/timetable app built with Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform, targeting Android, iOS,
Desktop, and Web from a single codebase. It includes an optional API server for cloud sync.

## Project Structure

## Module Dependencies

```
app:android ─┐
app:ios ─────┼─> app:shared ─> data ─> utils
app:desktop ─┤       │
app:web ─────┘       └─> api:client ─> api:models ─> data
                     └─> app:app-interface

                    app:app-datastore (Android/iOS/Desktop)
                    app:app-localstorage (Web)

api:server ─> api:models ─> data
```

## Build & Dev Commands

```bash
# Run desktop app
./gradlew :app:desktop:run

# Run tests
./gradlew :app:shared:jvmTest
./gradlew :api:server:test

# Build (convention: build{Target}{BuildType}{Format})
./gradlew :builder:buildAndroidReleaseApk
./gradlew :builder:buildMacOSReleaseDmg
./gradlew :builder:buildLinuxReleaseAppImage
./gradlew :builder:buildWindowsReleaseMsi
./gradlew :builder:buildWebCompatReleaseZip
./gradlew :api:server:buildFatJar
```

Desktop builds only run on the corresponding OS. Artifacts output to `builder/build/artifacts/`.

## Code Style

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use `expect/actual` for platform-specific implementations
- Place shared UI in `app/shared/src/commonMain/`
- License header required in all Kotlin files (AGPLv3)
- Dependencies: add to `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, use as `libs.xxx` in build scripts
