# ADAPTIVE MEMORY BANK SYSTEM OVERVIEW

> **TL;DR:** This system uses structured documentation as AI memory across sessions. It offers four complexity levels that scale from quick bug fixes to complex systems, adapting the process while maintaining documentation quality. Tasks.md serves as the single source of truth for task tracking.

## 🎯 SYSTEM PURPOSE

The Adaptive Memory Bank System creates persistent memory for AI assistants through structured documentation that scales based on task complexity. It addresses the fundamental limitation of LLMs forgetting context between interactions.

## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Documentation as Memory** - Documentation is mission-critical infrastructure
2. **Adaptive Process Scaling** - Process complexity matches task requirements
3. **Single Source of Truth** - Tasks.md is the only place for task status tracking
4. **Strategic Content Organization** - Balance between core files and detailed examples
5. **Verification Steps** - Explicit checks prevent steps from being skipped
6. **Reference Triggers** - Force documentation consultation at critical points
7. **Processing Efficiency** - Optimized structure for LLM comprehension
8. **Structured Creative Thinking** - Creative phases as dedicated thinking spaces for complex problem-solving

## 📏 ADAPTIVE PROCESS LEVELS

### Level 1: Quick Bug Fix
- **Focus**: Simple errors, UI glitches, minor issues
- **Process**: Streamlined with minimal documentation
- **Task Updates**: 2-3 updates (start/end)
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Targeted updates to relevant files

### Level 2: Simple Enhancement
- **Focus**: Small features, minor improvements
- **Process**: Basic with essential documentation
- **Task Updates**: 4-6 updates at key milestones
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Updates to related files

### Level 3: Intermediate Feature
- **Focus**: Complete features, significant changes
- **Process**: Standard with full section tracking
- **Task Updates**: 8-12 updates at defined points
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Comprehensive updates to most files

### Level 4: Complex System
- **Focus**: Major systems, architectural changes
- **Process**: Full formal process with detailed checkpoints
- **Task Updates**: 15+ updates with formal verification
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Extensive updates to all files with cross-linking

## 🎨 CREATIVE PHASE HANDLING

For complex problem-solving, creative phases act as dedicated thinking spaces:

1. **Problem Breakdown** - Break complex problems into component parts for systematic analysis
2. **Option Exploration** - Consider multiple approaches with explicit pros/cons
3. **Systematic Verification** - Verify each option against specific requirements and constraints
4. **Checkpoint Process** - Use structured checkpoints to verify progress and compliance
5. **Comprehensive Verification** - Perform explicit verification before concluding creative work

Creative phase documentation scales with task complexity:
- **Level 1**: Minimal creative exploration markers
- **Level 2**: Basic creative phase structure
- **Level 3-4**: Full structured thinking with verification checkpoints

### Creative Phase Applications
- **Algorithm Design**: Analyze complexity requirements, alternative approaches, edge cases
- **UI/UX Design**: Explore layout options, information architecture, accessibility
- **Architecture Planning**: Design component boundaries, communication patterns, security models

## 📏 RULE TYPES

### 1️⃣ Always-Applied Rules
```
---
description: 
globs: 
alwaysApply: true
---
```
- Applied to every command regardless of context
- Used for critical rules that must always be followed
- Kept concise to minimize context window usage
- Examples: main.mdc, verification-checklist-simplified.mdc

### 2️⃣ Auto-Attached Rules
```
---
description: 
globs: "**/memory-bank/**", "**/.cursorrules"
alwaysApply: false
---
```
- Applied when working with matching file patterns
- Used for context-specific rules
- Can be more detailed since only loaded when relevant
- Examples: memory-bank.mdc, task-tracking.mdc

### 3️⃣ Agent-Requested Rules
```
---
description: CRITICAL: Contains mandatory examples. DO NOT assume patterns without consulting.
globs: "**/src/**"
alwaysApply: false
---
```
- Agent explicitly instructed to read these files
- Used for detailed examples and verbose content
- Helps manage context window by moving details out of main files
- Examples: workflow-examples.mdc, command-examples.mdc, creative-phase-examples.mdc
