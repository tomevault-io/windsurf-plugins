# Brave Web Search

Enables real-time web search via the Brave Search API.

## Instructions

Call the `run_js` tool with:
- **script name**: `index.html`
- **data**: a valid JSON string — keep it short and simple

### CRITICAL: JSON format rules

The data field MUST be a single valid JSON object. Follow these rules strictly:

- `query` must be a SINGLE string, not multiple strings
- Do NOT split the query into multiple quoted words
- Keep the query concise: 2-6 keywords maximum
- Write English keywords when possible for better results

CORRECT examples:
```
{"query":"OpenClaw history 2025","count":5}
{"query":"AI news today","count":5,"freshness":"pw"}
{"query":"比特币价格","count":5}
```

WRONG examples (never do this):
```
{"query":"OpenClaw" "2月" "火" "到"}   ← multiple strings, INVALID
{"query": "搜索最近的关于OpenClaw从2月份爆火到现在的完整经历"}  ← too long
```

### Parameters

- `query` (string, required): 2-6 keywords, keep short
- `count` (number, optional): 1-10, default 5
- `freshness` (string, optional): `"pd"` past day, `"pw"` past week, `"pm"` past month

### For long research tasks

If the user wants a long report, call the tool **multiple times** with different queries, then synthesize all results into the final answer. Example for "OpenClaw发展历史":
1. `{"query":"OpenClaw 2025 launch","count":5}`
2. `{"query":"OpenClaw viral February 2025","count":5}`
3. `{"query":"OpenClaw latest news","count":5,"freshness":"pm"}`

## Interpreting Results

- `result.web_results`: array of `{title, url, description, age}`
- `result.news_results`: array of `{title, url, description, age, source}`
- `result._debug`: which proxy succeeded

Summarize results in the user's language. Cite sources with URLs.
