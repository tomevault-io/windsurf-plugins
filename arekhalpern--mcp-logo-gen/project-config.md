Logo Generation and Background Removal Process

1. Generate Logo Image
   - Use generate_image
   - The response will contain a URL to the generated image
   - pass the url to the remove_background tool

2. Remove Background
   - use remove_background
   - Input: URL from the generated image
   - The response will contain a new URL with the background-removed version

3. Download Final Image
   - Take the URL from the background removal step
   - Download to a local directory (e.g., 'downloads')
   - The final image will have a transparent background

   4. Create Scaled Versions
   - Take the downloaded image
   - Create 32x32 and 128x128 versions
   - Save alongside the original in the downloads directory
   - All versions maintain transparency
