## Style Guide

### UI Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling where possible
- When refactoring inline styles, use tailwind classes
- Use platform-native UI components (see below) first with shadcn/ui as a fallback
- Maintain visual consistency with the host application's design system
- Follow responsive design principles

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Prefer `type` over `interface`
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Prefer arrow functions over regular function declarations
- Use named parameters (object destructuring) when a function has more than 2 parameters

### Code Formatting

- Use Prettier with the project's configuration
- Maintain consistent naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components and types
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - UPPERCASE for constants

### Code Organization

- Prefer small, focused functions over inline code
- Extract complex logic into well-named functions
- Function names should describe their purpose clearly
- Choose descriptive function names that make comments unnecessary
- Break down complex operations into smaller, meaningful functions
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for better readability
- Prefer util functions for reusable logic and common operations

### Documentation

- Add comments only when necessary; descriptive names should minimize the need for comments
- Explain the why, not the what, focusing on reasoning, trade-offs, and approaches
- Document limitations, known bugs, or edge cases where behavior may not align with expectations
- Prefer sentence case in documentation and feature descriptions; capitalize official product/plugin names and exact UI labels, buttons, or titles, but keep generic feature terms lowercase to emphasize user actions

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure tests are meaningful and maintainable
