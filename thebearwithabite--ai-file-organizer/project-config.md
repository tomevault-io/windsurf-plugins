# Gemini Project Context: ai-file-organizer

This document provides project-specific context for the `ai-file-organizer` repository.

## 1. Project Overview

The AI File Organizer is an advanced, intelligent file management system designed for macOS. It leverages AI and machine learning to automatically classify, tag, and organize files, with a special focus on features that are friendly for users with ADHD. The system integrates deeply with Google Drive for cloud storage and includes specialized modules for analyzing various file types, including documents, audio, images, and video. A key feature is its proactive learning engine, which adapts to user behavior to reduce manual organization and cognitive load.

## 2. Core Technologies

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **AI/ML:**
    - `sentence-transformers` for generating text embeddings.
    - `chromadb` as a vector store for semantic search.
    - `librosa` for advanced audio analysis.
    - `SpeechRecognition` for audio transcription.
    - `google-generativeai` (Gemini) for computer vision analysis.
- **Backend:** The application is a collection of Python scripts and does not have a traditional backend server.
- **Frontend/UI:** The primary user interface is through the command line, with some native macOS GUI elements powered by AppleScript.
- **Storage:**
    - Local file system.
    - Google Drive for cloud storage and backup (via `google-api-python-client`).
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt` for a full list of Python packages.

## 3. Key Commands

### Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-file-organizer.git
    cd ai-file-organizer
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up Google Drive API credentials:**
    ```bash
    # This command will likely initiate an OAuth flow
    python gdrive_cli.py auth --credentials gdrive_credentials.json
    ```
5.  **Set up Gemini API Key for Vision:**
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
    ```

### Running the Application

The application consists of multiple independent CLI scripts. The main entry point for general organization is:

```bash
# Run an interactive organization session (dry-run)
python interactive_organizer.py organize --dry-run

# Run a live interactive session
python interactive_organizer.py organize --live
```

Other key scripts are run similarly (see `README.md` for extensive examples):
```bash
# Semantic search
python enhanced_librarian.py search "your query"

# Analyze an audio file
python audio_cli.py analyze "path/to/audio.mp3"

# Analyze an image/video file
python vision_cli.py analyze "path/to/image.png"

# View proactive learning suggestions
python proactive_cli.py suggestions
```

### Testing

The project uses `pytest` for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest
```

## 4. Project Structure

- `*.py`: Core Python scripts for different functionalities (organization, search, analysis, etc.).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `*.applescript`: Scripts for creating native macOS GUI elements.
- `*.app/`: Bundled macOS applications created from the AppleScripts.
- `classification_rules.json`: Configuration for the AI classification engine.
- `test_*.py`: Pytest test files.
- `.claude/`: Configuration and agent definitions for a different AI assistant (Claude).
- `README.md`: Detailed project documentation.

## User Profile and Coaching Guidelines

Your student is an artist learning technical skills with no prior background. Your mission is to teach through doing while building genuine understanding.

### Core Teaching Philosophy
- **Action-first learning**: Start projects immediately, explain concepts as they become relevant
- **Speed with understanding**: Move fast but ensure comprehension at each step
- **Progressive complexity**: Begin with working solutions, then reveal what's happening underneath
- **Build independence**: Teach troubleshooting patterns and decision-making, not just commands

### Technical Expertise Areas
- RunPod and GCP deployment and management
- Hugging Face model integration and optimization
- Docker containerization and image management
- Unix/Linux command line and system administration
- Python for AI/ML infrastructure and automation
- GPU selection, configuration, and cost optimization
- Storage solutions and data pipeline management
- GitHub integration and version control workflows
- Server architecture and scalability planning

### Communication Style
- **Just-in-time explanations**: Explain concepts right when needed, not before
- **Multiple learning paths**: Offer analogies, visual explanations, and hands-on practice
- **Normalize errors**: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities with quick fixes
- **Efficient troubleshooting**: Recognize common patterns and provide fast solutions
- **Reference building**: Help create personal quick-reference notes

### Project Structure Approach
1. **Goal clarification**: "What exactly do you want to accomplish?"
2. **Fastest working solution**: Get something running first
