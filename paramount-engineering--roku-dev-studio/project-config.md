description: Ask the user before updating engineering-principles.md when structural / engineering / guideline changes happen

# Keep `engineering-principles.md` current

`.discussion-docs/engineering-principles.md` is the workspace's living engineering style guide. It must stay current as the codebase's architecture and the user's stated preferences evolve.

## When to prompt the user

Ask the user whether the takeaway should be added to `engineering-principles.md` whenever any of the following happens in the conversation:

1. **Structural change**: a refactor, file move, package layout change, or shift in module boundaries.
2. **Engineering change**: a new pattern, new abstraction, change to how code is organized or how data flows (e.g. centralizing state, swapping a poll-driven path for subscribe-driven, adding a new validator surface).
3. **New guideline stated by the user**: any "always do X", "never use Y", "always prefer Z over W", or process expectation expressed during the conversation — even if no code change accompanies it.

## When not to prompt

- Pure bug fixes that don't change architecture or expose a new pattern.
- Typo / wording / formatting fixes.
- Verifying / running tests.
- Re-stating an existing principle (already in the doc).

## How to prompt

After the relevant change has landed (or as soon as the user states a guideline), ask one focused question. Keep it short, concrete, and propose the entry text so the user can say "yes / no / yes-but-rephrase":

> "Worth adding to `engineering-principles.md`? I'd put it under §<section> as: <one-sentence principle> + <code reference>."

Wait for an explicit yes before editing the file. Do not silently update.

## How to update (after a "yes")

- Match the existing tone: opinionated, repo-specific, grounded in code.
- Each principle has: a name, a one-paragraph explanation, the code reference(s) that prove it lives in the repo, and the anti-pattern it replaces.
- Add to the appropriate existing section (Engineering principles / Anti-patterns / Concrete patterns / Process). Don't open a new top-level section unless the user asked for one.
- If the change ships in a separate design doc (`.discussion-docs/<topic>.md`), cross-reference it rather than duplicating content.
- Keep entries terse. The doc is for orientation, not exhaustive specification.

## Concrete examples

✅ *Trigger.* User asks: "Move `validateAndNormalizeRaleCommandArgs` into the api package and make every consumer go through it." → after the diff lands, ask: *"Worth adding to engineering-principles.md as a new entry under §Engineering principles confirming we centralize validation rules at the producer layer (api package), not at consumer surfaces?"*

✅ *Trigger.* User says: "Don't ever poll for state; always subscribe." → ask: *"Want me to add this to engineering-principles.md under §Engineering principles? Proposed entry: 'Subscribe-driven UI > poll-driven UI > timer-driven UI' with a reference to `AppConnector.onStateChange`."*

✅ *Trigger.* User asks for a brand-new test runner / build pipeline / IPC channel. → after it lands, ask whether the new pattern should be documented.

❌ *Not a trigger.* "Fix the typo in this comment." → no.
❌ *Not a trigger.* "Bump REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS to 35s." → it's a value change, not a new principle.

## If the user keeps declining

If the user repeatedly says "no" to similar prompts in a session, stop asking for the rest of that session — they've signaled the threshold for what's worth recording is higher than this rule's default. Resume on the next session.
