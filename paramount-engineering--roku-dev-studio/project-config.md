# Scope and design approval

## Before you implement

**Stop and ask the user first** (briefly: intent, options, tradeoffs) before:

- **New functionality** — new commands, APIs, UI behaviors, integrations, or features that go beyond the current task.
- **Major design changes** — protocol or data-shape changes, new architecture, broad refactors, or anything that would surprise a reviewer in a large diff.

## When you may proceed without asking

- **Small fixes** in files already in scope: typos, obvious bugs, linter issues, matching existing patterns.
- **Edits the user explicitly requested** in the current message.
- **Clarifying questions** in chat are fine; this rule is about **not landing unrequested scope** in code.

## If unsure

Treat it as **ask first**. A one-sentence check (“I’m about to add X; OK?”) is enough.
