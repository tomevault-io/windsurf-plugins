description: Don't bake any specific Roku channel's names, params, or identifiers into this repo
---


# No channel-specific identifiers in this repo

This repository ships **Roku Dev Studio** — a generic developer tool that talks to *any* sideloaded Roku channel via ECP and the App Connector / RALE protocol. It must not contain identifiers that belong to one specific Roku app.

## What is forbidden

- **App Connector function names** — e.g. anything you saw on a particular sideloaded channel via `list_app_connector_functions`. Those names (`HandlePlayBack`, `LoadTrackingConfig`, `GetMediaCapabilities`, etc.) are exposed by **one** channel and will not exist on another.
- **App-specific parameter names** — `resourceConfig`, `trackingConfigInput`, etc. — for the same reason. They're declared by one channel's `ExecuteFunction` implementation.
- **Branded reverse-DNS / package identifiers** — `com.<brand>.<thing>`, `com.<company>.<thing>`. Use `com.roku-dev-studio.<thing>` or another neutral name.
- **Live data captured during testing** — registry values (e.g. `aviaAdobeECID`, `crossPublisherIdHash`), Adobe ECIDs, dev passwords, content URLs, channel-specific JSON payloads. Even if seen in chat or a screenshot, do **not** copy them into source / docs / fixtures.

This applies to:

- Source files (`*.ts`, `*.js`, `*.brs`, `*.xml`, `*.json`)
- Prose under `packages/roku-dev-studio-mcp/src/prose/**`
- READMEs, design docs under `.discussion-docs/`
- Op descriptions in `packages/roku-dev-studio-api/lib/operations.ts`
- Validation messages, comments, examples — anywhere user-visible or agent-visible text lives

## What to write instead

Use placeholders + an instruction to discover at runtime:

✅ Good (generic):

```ts
// Builder stores `functionParams` as a positional array; agents sometimes
// send a single object keyed by the channel's RALE param names instead
// (`{ <paramName>: value }`). Normalize either shape to a positional array.
```

```md
Generic shape (substitute `<FunctionName>` and parameter value(s) for
whatever `list_app_connector_functions` returned):

```
app_function({
  functionName: "<FunctionName>",
  functionParams: [ /* one entry per declared param, in RALE order */ ]
})
```
```

❌ Bad (channel-specific):

```ts
// e.g. agents send `{ resourceConfig: {...} }` for HandlePlayBack
```

```md
Example: `app_function({ functionName: "HandlePlayBack", functionParams: [ { resourceConfig: {...} } ] })`
```

## Why

- The MCP server, the prose, and the op descriptions are read by agents that work against **any** customer channel. If we ship them with one channel's names, agents will hallucinate those names against channels that don't have them — exactly what happened with `HandlePlayBack` in the field.
- Public repo / artifacts: leaking proprietary function names, registry keys, dev passwords, or content URLs is a real privacy/security issue.
- Hypothetical signatures (`(contentId, autoPlay)`, `params[0]`/`params[1]`) are fine when they illustrate the *shape* — just label them as illustrative.

## When you encounter a violation

1. Replace the specific name with a `<placeholder>` plus a sentence telling the agent to call `list_app_connector_functions` (or the equivalent discovery tool).
2. If the live data was a registry value / token / URL, scrub it entirely.
3. Re-run the relevant build (`roku-dev-studio-api`, `roku-dev-studio-mcp`) so the regenerated `dist/` bundles also drop the leaked identifier.
4. Confirm with: `rg -i 'forbidden-name' --glob '!.claude/**' --glob '!**/dist/**' --glob '!**/node_modules/**'`.
