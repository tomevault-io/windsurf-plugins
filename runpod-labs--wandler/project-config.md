<!-- Do not edit or remove this section -->
This document exists for non-obvious, error-prone shortcomings in the codebase, the model, or the tooling that an agent cannot figure out by reading the code alone. No architecture overviews, file trees, build commands, or standard behavior. When you encounter something that belongs here, first consider whether a code change could eliminate it and suggest that to the user. Only document it here if it can't be reasonably fixed.

- `TextStreamer` from `@huggingface/transformers` requires the tokenizer to have `all_special_ids` (array) and `decode(ids, opts)` — mocking the tokenizer without these will crash at construction time. See `tests/e2e/helpers.ts` for a working mock.
- `TextStreamer.put()` expects `bigint[][]`, not `number[][]`. The mock model's generate must call `streamer.put()` and `streamer.end()` — not `streamer.callback_function()` directly.
- `presence_penalty` / `frequency_penalty` from the OpenAI API don't map 1:1 to transformers.js. We approximate them via `repetition_penalty` (> 1.0). This is a lossy mapping — they aren't the same thing.
- Gemma 4 ONNX exports don't include a chat template in `tokenizer_config.json` (Google ships it as a separate `chat_template.jinja` file). The model manager in `src/models/manager.ts` auto-loads this file from the HuggingFace repo at startup. This is a Google-side issue — Gemma 2 and 3 exports include the template correctly.
- Gemma's `chat_template.jinja` does `value['type'] | upper` on every tool-parameter property, crashing with `Cannot apply filter "upper" to type: UndefinedValue` when a property omits `type` (JSON Schema allows this). `formatChat` in `src/models/tokenizer.ts` sanitizes tool schemas before passing them to the template, defaulting any property missing `type` to `"string"`. Upstream Gemma template bug.
- Tool calls stream incrementally: `src/generation/stream-tools.ts` watches the token stream for family-specific openers (`<tool_call>`, `[tool_calls`, `call:`, `"tool_calls"`, or an LFM Pythonic `[name(` regex). Tokens are emitted as content deltas with a trailing `SAFETY_BUFFER` held back, so a partial opener never leaks as content. Once an opener is seen, emission freezes and `parseToolCalls()` runs on each new token until it returns a full call; that's when the structured `tool_calls` delta fires. If generation ends without a match the locked tail is flushed as content.
- The `feature-extraction` pipeline returns `{ data: Float32Array }` — the embeddings route casts this to `Array.from()` for JSON serialization. Large embedding batches may be slow due to sequential processing.
- `stop` sequences are approximated by tokenizing each stop string and using the last token as an extra `eos_token_id`. Multi-token stop sequences won't match exactly — only the final token triggers stopping. A proper `StoppingCriteria` implementation would be needed for exact matching.
- The `/v1/completions` streaming path dynamically imports `TextStreamer` via `await import("@huggingface/transformers")` to avoid circular dependency issues with the generation module.
- 1-bit / 2-bit dtypes (`q1`, `q1f16`, `q2`, `q2f16`) from transformers.js v4.1+ use ONNX Runtime ternary kernels that only ship with the CPU and WebGPU execution providers. On `device=cuda|coreml|dml` the load will silently slide down to CPU via our fallback chain — `warnIfLowBitMismatch` in `src/models/manager.ts` logs a hint when this is about to happen. Also, the onnx-community ecosystem of pre-exported BitNet models is still thin; `microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T` has an open ONNX export discussion (HF discussions/8) but no official `onnx-community/bitnet-*` repo yet.
- Vision-first probe: `loadLLMWithDevice` in `src/models/manager.ts` fetches `config.json` once via `isLikelyVisionModel` before trying `AutoModelForImageTextToText`. This avoids a wasted vision download for text-only giants like GPT-OSS 20B. If the fetch fails (private model, offline, HF rate-limit), the probe returns `null` and we fall back to the old try-vision-then-text behaviour — so offline loads keep working.
