# AGENTS.md - AI Assistant Context for jjq

## Project Overview

jjq is a merge queue CLI tool for jj (Jujutsu VCS).

## Important things to remember

### jj

`jj squash` is interactive - it'll block your tool use waiting for input if
you are not careful

### Landing commits on main

The `main` bookmark is protected and immutable. Do NOT try to move it
directly with `jj bookmark set/move` or `jj tug`. Instead, use jjq itself:

```sh
jjq push @    # queue the commit
jjq run       # land it on main
```

## Key Files / Paths

- `src/` - root of the Rust implementation
- `tests/e2e.rs` - end-to-end integration tests (insta snapshots)
- `docs/README.md` - high-level overview
- `docs/specification.md` - RFC-style specification

## Architecture

### Data Storage

jjq stores all state in the jj repository itself:

1. **Bookmarks** - Used for queue items and failed items
   - `jjq/queue/NNNNNN` - Queued items (6-digit zero-padded sequence ID)
   - `jjq/failed/NNNNNN` - Failed merge attempts

2. **Filesystem locks** - Uses `flock(2)` files in `.jj/jjq-locks/`
   - `run` - Ensures only one queue runner at a time
   - `id` - Protects sequence ID allocation
   - `config` - Serializes config reads/writes

3. **Isolated branch** - `jjq/_/_` bookmark points to a branch parented to `root()` that holds:
   - `last_id` file - Current sequence ID
   - `config/` directory - User configuration
   - Commit messages serve as operation log (with trailers for structured data)

### Commands

| Command | Function |
|---------|----------|
| `init [--trunk <bookmark>] [--check <cmd>] [--strategy <strategy>]` | Initialize jjq, set trunk, check command, and strategy |
| `push <revset>` | Add revision to queue (idempotent: clears stale entries for same change ID) |
| `run [--all] [--stop-on-failure]` | Process next queue item, or all items in batch; failure output shows concrete jj commands with actual change IDs |
| `check [--rev <revset>] [-v]` | Run check command against a revision (default @); -v shows workspace/env details |
| `status [id] [--json] [--resolve]` | Show queue, recent failures (with conflicting file paths), and recently landed items; supports JSON output and single-item detail view |
| `requeue <id>` | Re-push a failed item back onto the queue (with pre-flight conflict check) |
| `delete <id>` | Remove item from queue/failed |
| `config [key] [value]` | Get/set configuration |
| `clean` | Remove all jjq workspaces |
| `doctor` | Validate config, locks, and workspace preconditions |
| `tail [--all] [--no-follow]` | View the last check output (with optional follow) |
| `quickstart` | Print a short guide for LLM agents |

### Exit Codes

| Code | Constant | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| 0 | *(success)* | Success |
| 1 | `CONFLICT` | Merge conflict, check failed, trunk moved during run, or run lock unavailable |
| 2 | `PARTIAL` | Batch run processed some items but left failures |
| 3 | `LOCK_HELD` | Sequence ID allocation lock held (push contention) |
| 10 | `USAGE` | Bad arguments, item not found, invalid revset |

### Key Concepts

- **Sequence ID** - Monotonically increasing integer for FIFO ordering
- **Runner workspace** - Temporary jj workspace in `/tmp` for running checks
- **Check command** - User-configured shell command that determines success/failure
- **Pre-flight conflict check** - Headless merge commit to verify clean merge before queuing
- **Idempotent push** - Re-pushing a change ID clears stale queue/failed entries; same commit ID is rejected as duplicate
- **Requeue** - Re-pushes a failed item back onto the queue, running a pre-flight conflict check first; a shortcut for fixing and re-pushing manually
- **Landing strategy** - How the candidate is landed on trunk: `rebase` (default) or `merge`

### Concurrency

- `flock(2)` file locks are used as mutexes
- Lock files stored in `.jj/jjq-locks/` (outside jj's tracked areas)
- `run` lock ensures only one queue runner at a time
- `id` lock protects sequence ID allocation
- `config` lock guards config read/write

### Batch Mode (`run --all`)

When running in batch mode, jjq processes items in sequence:
- Failed items are recorded and processing continues unless `--stop-on-failure` is set
- Summary reports merged and failed counts
- Exits 0 if all items merged or queue was empty; exits 2 (`PARTIAL`) if any items failed

## Testing

The project uses Rust integration tests with insta snapshot testing (`tests/e2e.rs`):

```sh
cargo test
```

Tests create temporary jj repositories with pre-built templates (Go projects, multi-PR scenarios, conflict setups) and exercise the full merge queue workflow including conflict handling, batch mode, rebase/merge strategies, exit codes, and idempotent push behavior.

There is also a legacy shell-based e2e script (`jjq-test`) from before the Rust port.

## Development Notes

- jjq is implemented in Rust
- use the Nix flake here for a development shell `nix develop` and to build the artifacts `nix build` -> `./result/bin/jjq`
- All jj interaction is via the `jj` CLI (no API)
- Uses `jj log -T'...'` templates for structured output parsing
- `run_quiet` helper suppresses output on success, shows on failure
- Operations are recorded as commits with trailer metadata on the `jjq/_/_` branch
