# React Flow

## Library

- Use **@xyflow/react** (React Flow v12). Import components and styles: `import { ReactFlow, Background, Controls, MiniMap } from '@xyflow/react'` and `import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css'`.

## Workflow Graph Model

- **Nodes**: One node per workflow job (key in `workflow.jobs`). Node `id` = job id. `data` holds job metadata (e.g. `label: job name or id`).
- **Edges**: Job dependencies. For each job, if `needs` is present (string or array), create an edge from each needed job to this job. Edge `id`: e.g. `{neededJobId}-{currentJobId}`.

## Patterns

- Keep initial nodes/edges in state or derived from `Workflow` so the graph updates when workflow changes.
- Use controlled mode: pass `nodes` and `edges` (and `onNodesChange`, `onEdgesChange` if editing). Prefer fitting view: `fitView` for initial layout.
- Custom node types: define in `nodeTypes` when you need job-specific UI (e.g. step count, status placeholder). Default node type is fine for simple labels.

## Layout

- Position nodes explicitly or use a layout utility (e.g. dagre) for DAG layout based on `needs`. For a first version, manual or simple auto-layout is fine.
- Store positions in node `position`; React Flow uses these for rendering and fitView.

## Styling

- Canvas: use Tailwind on the wrapper (e.g. `className="bg-slate-50"`). Background, controls, minimap are from the library; override via CSS or theme if needed.
- Keep the flow inside a bounded container (e.g. `flex-1 overflow-hidden`) so it doesn’t break the page layout.
