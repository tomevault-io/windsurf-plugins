# AGENTS.md

Repo-wide agent instructions for `sixb`.

## Scope

- This file applies to the whole repository unless a nearer `AGENTS.md` is added later.
- Keep one root `AGENTS.md` for now. Add nested files only when a package genuinely needs different instructions.

## Repo Map

- `packages/core`: runtime, ontology builders, providers, and validation
- `packages/server`: Elysia HTTP/WebSocket API and OpenAPI generation
- `packages/atlas`: built-in React UI (the Atlas app); pages live in `src/pages/`
- `packages/ui`: shared React component library used by Atlas
- `packages/client`: generated typed client artifacts
- `packages/cli`: CLI entrypoint for `sixb`
- `packages/create-sixb`: zero-dependency project scaffolder and template
- `packages/app`: custom app integration
- `connectors/`, `storage/`, `broker/`: integrations and infrastructure providers
- `examples/`: runnable sample projects

## Toolchain

- Bun only for package management, scripts, and runtime. Do not use `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or Vite CLI commands.
- TypeScript is `strict`, targets ES2022, uses ESNext modules, and `moduleResolution: "bundler"`.
- Formatting and linting are enforced with Biome.
- Prefer `rg` and `rg --files` for search.

## Core Commands

Repo-wide:

```bash
bun install
bun run build
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run test:e2e
bun run test:all
bun run check
bun run check:fix
bun run generate:client
bun sixb dev
bun create-sixb my-app
```

Targeted:

```bash
bun --filter @sixb/core build
bun --filter @sixb/core typecheck
bun test packages/core/tests/create-sixb.test.ts
bun test packages/server/tests/
```

CI runs these as independent parallel jobs (each does `bun install --frozen-lockfile` first):

- `typecheck`: `bun run typecheck`
- `build`: `bun run build`, then `bun run test:publish`
- `client`: `bun run generate:client`, then `git diff --exit-code`
- `test`: `bun run test:ci`
- `lint`: `bun run check`
- `e2e`: package-scoped matrix jobs for packages with `test:e2e`

`test:ci` is `bun test` wrapped in `scripts/ci-guard.ts`, which fails the run at the first 60-second
silence and prints the last test file, the process tree, and each thread's kernel wait state. The
job's `timeout-minutes` is only a backstop: a job that dies at its own wall clock reports
"cancelled" with the log ending mid-stream, which is indistinguishable from every other cause. The
guard exists because a `Bun.build()` deadlock once cost five 15-minute runs before anyone found the
one named failure buried in the log.

`typecheck` uses the TypeScript project-reference graph: `bun run build:types` (`tsc -b
tsconfig.build.json`) checks every package's `src` exactly once, `tsconfig.tests.json` checks
test files against the emitted `.d.ts`, and the example/docs apps keep their own
`typegen && tsc` typecheck (`typecheck:examples`). The old per-package `tsc --noEmit` re-checked
shared source (notably `@sixb/core`) once per dependent, which made the step the CI bottleneck.

The root config maps `@sixb/*` to `packages/*/src`, which is right for workspace development and
wrong for consumer typechecks: it pulls the whole framework into each example's program. Examples
keep that config as their default because Bun reads it while bundling dev apps. Their typecheck
scripts alone pass `--paths null`, which clears the inherited mapping and lets `tsc` resolve each
package's `exports.types`. This is why the steps are chained with `&&`: a consumer type-checked
without a prior `build:types` fails on unresolved `@sixb/*` imports.

That ordering is also the limit of where the override applies. `apps/docs` stays entirely on the
root config because Vercel deploys it with `prepare:docs && next build` and never emits declarations
— pointing it at `dist` broke the deployment once already. Anything built or run outside this
repo's `typecheck` chain reads source.

## Architecture

- Define ontology types with `defineObjectType`, `prop`, `link`, `action`, and `defineValueType`.
- Most runtimes start with `createSixb()`.
- `createSixb()` auto-discovers `ontology/`, `actions/`, `datasets/`, `syncs/`, `schedules/`, `pipelines/`, `projections/`, `connectors/`, `rules/`, `workflows/`, `agents/`, and `security/{groups,roles,policies}/`. The `app/` directory is served separately and is not part of `createSixb()` discovery.
- `sixb.objects(MyType)` is the typed API for object CRUD, telemetry, links, and actions.
- Important domain events include `object.created`, `object.updated`, `object.deleted`, `link.created`, `link.updated`, `link.deleted`, `telemetry.appended`, and `action.requested`.
- Convention-based discovery is the normal registration model.
- Generated client files live in `packages/client/src/generated/`.
- If routes, schemas, or public contracts change, run `bun run generate:client`.

## Export Surfaces

- Exports are curated — never re-export something from a barrel just because it exists. If nothing imports it, it does not belong on a public surface; a selector or helper that can only return nothing is dead API.
- A package root (`.`) is for app authors: `@sixb/core` exports the authoring API (`define*`, `createSixb`, config types, and the `InMemory*` providers that fill a `createSixb` slot); other packages export only what consumers call (workers export just their `*Worker` class).
