# Genesis Workbench — Claude Code Entry Point

When a user in this repo asks for help with deployment, installation, development, troubleshooting, or workflow usage, load the relevant skill below **before** answering. These files contain authoritative step-by-step guidance, error auto-handlers, and validation commands that supersede general knowledge.

## Quick start — deploy

From this repo root:
```bash
./deploy.sh core <aws|azure|gcp>     # must be first; creates modules/core/.deployed
./deploy.sh <module> <cloud>          # each additional module, one at a time
```

Deploy modules **one at a time** and wait for each module's first post-deploy job to reach `RUNNING` before launching the next — this serializes GPU cluster-create and surfaces quota issues one module at a time. Full rationale + polling commands in the deploy wizard skill above.
