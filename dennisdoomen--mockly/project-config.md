# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in **Mockly**, a fluent HTTP mocking library for .NET
that intercepts `HttpClient` calls in tests. For the user-facing overview see
[`README.md`](./README.md) and [mockly.org](https://mockly.org/); for the fluent API cheat
sheet see [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

## Layout

- `Mockly/` — core library, multi-targeted `net8.0;net472` (the `Mockly` NuGet package).
- `Mockly.Specs/` — xUnit test suite (`net8.0` + `net472`).
- `Mockly.ApiVerificationTests/` — public API approval tests (`PublicApiGenerator` + Verify).
- `Build/` — Nuke build automation. `website/` — Docusaurus docs.

The FluentAssertions v7/v8 extensions live in a separate repo:
[dennisdoomen/fluentassertions.mockly](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/fluentassertions.mockly)
(referenced here only via `InternalsVisibleTo`).

## Build & test

```bash
./build.ps1        # or ./build.sh — Nuke build used by CI (build, test, API checks, pack)
dotnet build Mockly.sln -c Debug
dotnet test -c Debug
dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~Mockly.Specs.HttpMockSpecs+BasicUsage
```

- `TreatWarningsAsErrors` is on; analyzers run **only** on `net8.0` — fix issues there first.
- Tests run in Debug so FluentAssertions can report variable names. Keep coverage non-decreasing.

## Conventions

- C# style: follow the
  [csharp-guidelines skill](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/CSharpGuidelines/tree/main/Skills/csharp-guidelines);
  `.editorconfig` is authoritative (4-space indent, 130-col lines, braces on new lines).
- Tests: xUnit, Arrange-Act-Assert, scenarios grouped in nested classes (see
  `Mockly.Specs/HttpMockSpecs.cs`), snake-case method names, FluentAssertions for assertions.
- Chain-starting fluent methods use present-tense verbs (`ForGet`, `WithPath`, `RespondsWithStatus`).
- Keep the public API working on both `net472` and `net8.0`; XML-doc public members. Use
  `#if NET472_OR_GREATER` for the rare TFM-specific divergence and keep it minimal.
- Avoid new dependencies; never commit secrets; guard against ReDoS in matchers. Add any new
  analyzer packages to `Directory.Build.props` conditioned on `net8.0` with `<PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>`.

### Tests
- Tests should not use terms like "should" or "when". Instead, they should use a fact-based naming convention in snake casing.
- Test method names must describe observable behavior in business terms and must never start with or include the name of the method under test or any other code element. For example: `Returns_credit_report_for_valid_nl_company` ✅; `GetCompanyCreditReport_returns_credit_report_for_valid_nl_company_id` ❌.

## Public API changes

Public API changes need an `api-approved` issue first. When the approval tests in
`Mockly.ApiVerificationTests/` fail for an intended change, run `AcceptApiChanges.ps1` /
`AcceptApiChanges.sh` (or Rider's Verify Support) and commit the updated `ApprovedApi/` files.
