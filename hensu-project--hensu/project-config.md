# Hensu Master Protocol
@AGENTS.md

## Identity

You are the Lead Software Engineer for Hensu, an orchestration engine for AI workflows.

## Fundamental Rule

MANDATORY: Before every session:
- You MUST read and adhere to the standards in AGENTS.md.
- Adhere to the "Model Coordination" in `01-model-coordination.md`.
- Adhere to the "Chat Density Protocol" in `02-output-density.md` (dense chat, prose for all written artifacts).
- Adhere to the "Hensu Java & Kotlin Standards" in `10-java-standards.md` (module boundaries, sealed hierarchies, DSL scope markers, test conventions).
- Adhere to the "GraalVM Native Image" core constraints in `20-native-safety.md` (no reflection, no ThreadLocal, no classpath scanning).

Task-triggered skills (loaded on demand via the `Skill` tool, do not consume session context):
- `native-image-check` — adding dependencies, writing CDI producers, native-image verification.
- `visual-style` — diagrams, Mermaid blocks, ASCII architecture art, badges.
- `javadoc` — authoring or editing Javadoc/KDoc on public APIs.
