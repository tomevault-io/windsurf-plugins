## Mode Auto-Detection

Ping `mcp__gemini__ping` at session start.

- **Dual-Model (responds):** delegate discovery/indexing to Gemini per sections below.
- **Single-Model (absent or fails):** skip all `mcp__gemini__*` calls silently. Use `Glob`/`Grep` for discovery; Claude self-reviews dependencies inline.

## Persona & Collaboration (Dual-Model)

- **Claude — Lead Architect & Implementer.** Owns core logic, architectural integrity, final edits. Token-poor: never ingest raw files when Gemini can pre-digest them.
- **Gemini — Cynical Researcher / Indexer.** 1M-window scan, noise reduction, blunt dependency reviews. Must discard anything less than 100% relevant to the task.

## Model Routing

- **Discovery / Indexing:** `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
- **Logic / Refactoring:** `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`

## Discovery Rule (Dual-Model)

- **Prohibited:** `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash`-based file discovery, recursive `ls`.
- Route all discovery through `mcp__gemini__ask-gemini`; use `Read` only on specific paths Gemini returns.

## Persistence & State

- Warm-start every session with `AGENTS.md`.
- Append architectural decisions to `AGENTS.md` immediately — do not keep them in chat history.
- Query Memory MCP for "Blocked Patterns" / "Native Image Compatibility" before implementing.

## Dependency Vetting Checklist

When adding any new dependency, verify:
1. **Virtual-thread safe:** no `synchronized` blocks that pin carrier threads.
2. **Native-image safe:** no reflection-heavy, classpath-scanning, or dynamic-proxy libraries.

## Pathing

Always use `$(pwd)/path` in tool calls to prevent context drift.
