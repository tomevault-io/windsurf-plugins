description: Coding standards for Java 25 and Kotlin DSL, focusing on ScopedValues and type-safety.

Generic SOLID/KISS/YAGNI/DRY apply silently. Only project-specific rules below.

## Module boundaries

- `hensu-core` has **zero third-party deps** beyond JDK 25. No vendor SDKs, no vendor `if/else`.
- All `Agent` impls are interchangeable (Liskov). Capability differences go through narrow interfaces like `ToolCapable`, `Streamable` — never a God interface, never vendor-sniffing in the orchestration loop.
- Shared constants/schema live in `hensu-core` so CLI and Server speak the same language.
- Logic duplicated between `hensu-core` and `hensu-server` → extract to a shared util/base provider.

## Concurrency

- See `20-native-safety.md` §3 for the `ThreadLocal` ban and `ScopedValue` pattern.
- Verify no data bleeds between parallel workflow nodes during fan-out/fan-in.

## Domain model

- Domain results → `sealed interface` (e.g. `ExecutionResult`, `TransitionStatus`), consumed via `switch` pattern matching.
- All domain models immutable; construct via `hensu-serialization` builder mixins.

## Kotlin DSL

- `@WorkflowDsl` (meta `@DslMarker`) on `WorkflowBuilder`, `GraphBuilder`, `NodeBuilder` — prevents scope leakage (an `agent { }` block must not see parent `node { }`).

## Tests

- Unit: pure JVM, `StubAgentProvider` only — no network, no API cost.
- Integration: `@QuarkusTest`.
- Assertions: AssertJ.
