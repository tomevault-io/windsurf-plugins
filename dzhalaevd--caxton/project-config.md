# Repository guide for agents

Caxton is a typed, declarative Python library for building documents. The production path is spreadsheet → XLSX.
Specifications may discuss other families and advanced XLSX features that are not implemented.

## Read before changing

- **Architecture:** read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing public models, package boundaries,
  compilation, rendering, data ingestion, testing contracts, or extension points. Keep it as the single architectural
  source of truth.
- **Feature scope:** use the delivered-profile and deliberate-deferrals sections of `ARCHITECTURE.md`. A proposed API in
  a design note or use case is not an implementation contract.
- **Examples:** inspect the nearest existing flow under `example/basic`,
  `example/reusable`, `example/advanced`, `example/dashboard`,
  `example/template`, or `example/backend`. Extend a coherent flow rather than adding one example file per small
  feature.

## Route changes to the owning boundary

- Public factories and immutable nodes belong in `caxton.api` and
  `caxton.core.models`. Test construction, immutability, public exports, and typing together.
- Semantic values and presentation vocabulary belong in `caxton.core.types` and
  `caxton.core.formatting`. Each renderer owns its backend materialization.
- Data coercion and row evaluation belong in the ingestion/evaluation layers. Applications own framework lifecycle and
  query planning.
- Requirement analysis, renderer resolution, compilation, and layout are separate internal stages. Do not move renderer
  selection into models or backend execution into the family compiler.
- Template inspection and XLSX-native escape hatches stay in the template/XLSX route. Keep package XML paths and native
  workbook objects out of generic Core contracts.
- Testing features belong in `caxton.testing` and return immutable public views. Parsers, IR traversal, and diff
  implementation remain internal.

## Architecture guardrails

- Public factories create immutable semantic nodes. Generative methods return a new node. Nested public collections are
  normalized to read-only values.
- Semantic models contain intent only. Coordinates, resolved layout, execution state, caches, workbook objects, XML, and
  engine-native values stay outside the model.
- Preserve the dependency direction in `ARCHITECTURE.md`: `api` and `testing` may use private implementation modules;
  `_pipeline` coordinates `_spreadsheet`, `_xlsx`, and `_io`; `_xlsx` may use `_spreadsheet` and `_io`; `_source`,
  `_spreadsheet`, and `_io` depend only on Core. Private modules never import `api` or `testing`.
- Public operations return public types. Engine objects and mutable compiler state remain implementation details.
- Each document family owns its model, validation, compiler, IR, and testing view. Put family-specific behavior there
  rather than in a universal document or IR.
- Keep column `id`, `source`, and display `title` distinct. Expressions and selectors resolve semantic ids, not physical
  coordinates or titles.
- Coercion and structural validation never consume row data. Preserve
  `REITERABLE`/`ONE_SHOT`/`UNKNOWN` behavior and reject hidden extra passes.
- Resolve requirements, workbook operation, capabilities, and renderer compatibility before opening or writing the
  target.
- Raise stable `CaxtonError` subclasses with semantic context and preserve implementation exceptions through chaining.
- Do not introduce smart context-sensitive factories, universal document/IR types, framework adapters in Core, or global
  registries without first adding a concrete use case and updating `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Treat deferred capabilities as absent. Do not make a sketched name public just because it appears in a design note.

## Implementation workflow

1. Inspect the current git status, affected public contract, and tests. Preserve unrelated working-tree and index
   changes.
2. Write or update a focused test at the narrowest meaningful boundary:
   semantic model, layout, renderer, or artifact.
3. Implement the smallest coherent change while preserving the architecture guardrails above.
4. Run focused tests first, then the checks proportional to the change.
5. Review the final diff for accidental API exposure, eager data consumption, engine leakage, generated artifacts, and
   stale documentation.

Completion means the new behavior is tested, relevant contracts and examples agree with it, required checks pass, and no
unrelated files were rewritten.

## Commands

Use the checked-in `.venv` for focused iteration:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_rendering.py -q
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_streaming.py -q
```

Run the repository-level gates through tox, matching CI:

```bash
uv run --no-sync tox run -e py314
uv run --no-sync tox run -e pre-commit
uv run --no-sync tox run -e build
```

The full Python matrix is `py310`, `py311`, `py312`, `py313`, and `py314`. CI also tests the built wheel and sdist on
Linux, macOS, and Windows. The only convenience Make targets are `make coverage` and `make benchmark`.

Use `uv sync` only when the environment must be created or refreshed. The backend example has an independent environment
under `example/backend`.
