## What this project is

Runs Obsidian's own renderer in a regular browser - no Electron - by shimming the
Electron/Capacitor/Node APIs it expects. There is **one runtime core**
(`src/client-mobile/`) with a **swappable backend**:

| Layer | Status | Storage |
|-------|--------|---------|
| serverless | primary | OPFS in the browser + folder vaults (File System Access API) |
| server | supported | real files via `/api/fs` |

See `docs/architecture.md` for the full picture.

## Conventions - required

- **Node 18+ or Bun - depends on the package.** Most packages' scripts invoke `node`
  (`src/client-mobile` tests, `src/runtime-server/server`, the Cloudflare deployment's
  build script). `src/sync-server` is the one package that runs on `bun`
  (`bun index.js` / `bun test`). The maintainer's own dev environment symlinks `node`
  to `bun`, which is a local habit, not a repo-wide requirement - don't assume `bun`
  works for every package.
- **`vendor/` is gitignored.** It holds Obsidian's own bundle, generated locally by
  `scripts/update-obsidian-*.js`, and is never committed. This repository does not
  contain or distribute that bundle - each user downloads Obsidian themselves via the
  setup scripts. The public live demo deployment *does* serve the bundle to visitors'
  browsers (see `build-assets.sh`), which is a separate thing from this repo.
- **The bundle is minified.** Anchor any patch or edit to a **pattern / symbol
  shape**, never to a line number - line numbers move on every Obsidian release.
  See `scripts/patch-obsidian-mobile.js`, which documents this in-body.
- **No personal data in this repo.** Personal vault names, machine paths, run logs,
  and internal planning notes do not belong here.

## The site

`markport.pages.dev` is built by **Astro**, in `site/`. It is a separate package with its own
`package.json` and `node_modules`, deliberately kept away from the app's dependencies - nothing
in `site/` is part of what runs in a browser.

The content is **not** in `site/`. Pages are Markdown in `docs/`, so a document has one copy and
the site renders it:

| Route | Source |
|---|---|
| `/` · `/he/` | `docs/landing.md` · `docs/he/landing.md` |
| `/install` · `/he/install` | `docs/install.md` · `docs/he/install.md` |
| `/architecture` · `/he/architecture` | `docs/architecture.md` · `docs/he/architecture.md` |

`site/src/content.config.ts` lists those six files explicitly rather than globbing, so a new
document in `docs/` does not become a public page by accident. `docs/obsidian-version-support.md`
and `docs/system-plugin-dev-guide.md` are repo documentation and are deliberately not published.

```bash
cd site && npm install && npm run dev     # live reload
cd site && npm run build                  # -> .tmp/site/
```

The output carries **no JavaScript**. Code samples are highlighted at build time by Shiki.

## Layout

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Architecture and rationale | `docs/architecture.md` |
| Writing a system plugin | `docs/system-plugin-dev-guide.md` |
| Hebrew copies of the above | `docs/he/` |
| The markport.pages.dev site | `site/` (Astro; its own `package.json`) |
| Runtime (the browser side) | `src/client-mobile/` |
| Node backend (optional) | `src/runtime-server/` |
| Pull-sync server | `src/sync-server/` |
| Cloudflare deployment | `src/deployments/cloudflare/` |

## Before you touch the bundle

`vendor/obsidian-mobile/app.js` is Obsidian's proprietary code. We apply
**zero** build-time patches to the local copy - the extracted bundle is
byte-identical to Obsidian's own APK. `scripts/patch-obsidian-mobile.js`
still exists as infrastructure (an empty `PATCHES` list) for a future
Obsidian version that might need one; keep that list as small as possible,
and prefer a runtime shim over a patch whenever the same result is reachable
through a platform API.

**Precedent**: three of the four patches that used to exist were replaced by
a runtime shim - `src/client-mobile/platform-bridge.js`, which intercepts
`Object.defineProperty` to capture Obsidian's own `Platform` object instead
of rewriting app.js's byte-for-byte source. The fourth and last
(`vault-profile-on-desktop-layout`) was removed outright, once measurement
showed that `platform-bridge.js`'s existing `isDesktopApp` locking already
covers what it used to patch.
