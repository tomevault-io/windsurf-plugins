## TL;DR

> **Human command**  
> *“Create component CardTilt in inputs”*

> **Agent action**  
> 1. Make sure the name is **PascalCase** (`CardTilt`).  
> 2. Make sure the category folder exists (`registry/inputs`). If it does not exist, the script should handle this case by creating folder but ask them before proceeding.
> 3. Run **one** of:
>    ```bash
>    # Makefile alias (preferred – colours + var checks)
>    make component name=CardTilt category=inputs
>    # or the bare PNPM script
>    pnpm create-component CardTilt inputs
>    ```
> 4. Afterwards, update `config/docs.ts` → sidebarNav to include the item in appropriate category.  
> 5. If the command fails, surface stderr verbatim.
> 6. After the new component is created, run the `make registry` command to sync up with the registry.
> 7. Ensure the component and demo components created are `export default function` components.

### Reference

- Script: `scripts/create-component.js`  
- Default `type`: `registry:component` (override via third arg).  
- Converts names:
> • *kebab* → `toPascalCase` for the exported symbol  
> • Generates matching MDX docs, registry files, etc.

### House rules

1. **NEVER** touch `/registry/__generated__` – that’s the build output.  
2. If the component already exists, *exit early* with the friendly message from the script.  
3. Follow the **Contentlayer front-matter** template baked into the script: keep `title`, `description`, no extra fields.
