## Quick Start Workflow

### 1. Get your task

```bash
# Get the next available task (unblocked, highest priority)
GET /api/plans/{plan_id}/next-task
```

### 2. Claim it

```bash
PATCH /api/tasks/{task_id}
{"status": "in_progress", "assigned_to": "agent-id"}
```

### 3. Work through steps

For each step in the task:
1. Read the description
2. Do the work
3. Mark step completed: `PATCH /api/steps/{step_id} {"status": "completed"}`

### 4. Record decisions

When you make important choices:

```bash
POST /api/tasks/{task_id}/decisions
{
  "description": "Use JWT instead of sessions",
  "rationale": "Better for stateless API",
  "alternatives": ["Sessions", "OAuth"],
  "chosen_option": "JWT with refresh tokens"
}
```

### 5. Commit your changes

Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<Task title>

Changes:
- <change 1>
- <change 2>

Co-Authored-By: <Agent Name> <email>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

### 6. Mark complete

```bash
PATCH /api/tasks/{task_id}
{"status": "completed"}
```

## Checklist Before Completion

- [ ] All steps completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Constraints respected (clippy, tests, etc.)
- [ ] Changes committed
- [ ] Task marked as `completed`

## Getting Help

### Search for code patterns
```bash
GET /api/code/search?q=error+handling&limit=10
```

### Check impact before changes
```bash
GET /api/code/impact?target=src/models/user.rs
# Impact analysis now includes affecting_decisions (architectural decisions linked via AFFECTS)
```

### Find past decisions
```bash
# BM25 keyword search
GET /api/decisions/search?q=authentication
# Semantic vector search (recommended)
POST /api/decisions/search-semantic {"query": "how do we handle auth?", "limit": 5}
```

### Knowledge Fabric — Risk & Health

```bash
# Hotspots: files with high churn (frequently modified)
GET /api/code/hotspots?project_slug=my-project&limit=10

# Knowledge gaps: under-documented files
GET /api/code/knowledge-gaps?project_slug=my-project&limit=10

# Risk assessment: composite score (pagerank × churn × knowledge_gap × betweenness)
GET /api/code/risk-assessment?project_slug=my-project&limit=10

# Full health report (includes hotspots, knowledge_gaps, risk, neural_metrics)
GET /api/code/health?project_slug=my-project
```

### Knowledge Fabric — Admin Commands

```bash
# Bootstrap: initialize all Knowledge Fabric relations from historical data
POST /api/admin/bootstrap-knowledge-fabric {"project_id": "uuid"}

# Recalculate all GDS fabric scores (PageRank, Louvain, Betweenness multi-layer)
POST /api/admin/update-fabric-scores {"project_id": "uuid"}
```

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Do NOT mark task as `completed`.**

Instead:
1. Mark as `failed` with explanation
2. Or mark as `blocked` if waiting on something

```bash
PATCH /api/tasks/{task_id}
{"status": "failed"}

POST /api/wake
{
  "task_id": "uuid",
  "success": false,
  "summary": "Tests failing after X modification"
}
```

---

## Authentication

If auth is enabled on the server, agents using the REST API need a JWT token:

```bash
# Check available auth methods
curl http://localhost:8080/auth/providers

# Login with password (if configured)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "..."}'

# Or use Google OAuth / OIDC flow, then use the token:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" http://localhost:8080/api/plans
```

**Note:** MCP server (stdio) does not require auth. WebSocket connections authenticate via first message.

See [Authentication Guide](docs/guides/authentication.md) for details.
