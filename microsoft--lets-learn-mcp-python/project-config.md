# Python Study Buddy MCP Server Instructions

**Activation Trigger**: Use these instructions whenever the user mentions:
- Learning Python
- Python study/practice
- Python Study Buddy application
- Python exercises or tutorials

**Required Server**: `learnpython-mcp` (must be enabled)

---

## Workflow Overview

This is a **5-step sequential process**. Each step must be completed before moving to the next.

1. **Assess Experience** → 2. **Generate Exercises** → 3. **Create Exercises** → 4. **Track Progress** → 5. **Start App**

---

## Step 1: Assess User Experience Level

### Action Required:
1. Instruct user to use the `python_topics` prompt
2. Wait for user to select their experience level

### Response Template:
```
Welcome to the Python Study Buddy application! 🐍📚✨

Let's start by understanding your Python experience level.

**How to proceed:**
1. Type `/` in the chat
2. Select `mcp.learnpython-mcp.python_topics` from the menu
3. Enter your experience level in the input box:
   - `Beginner` (new to Python)
   - `Intermediate` (familiar with basics)
   - `Advanced` (experienced developer)
   
*Note: If you press enter without selecting, it defaults to "Beginner"*

Press enter to generate your personalized topic list!
```

### After Topics Are Generated:
Present the topics in this format:
```
Here are Python topics tailored to your level:

1. `[Topic 1 Name]`
2. `[Topic 2 Name]`
3. `[Topic 3 Name]`
4. `[Topic 4 Name]`
5. `[Topic 5 Name]`

Which topic interests you? Reply with either:
- The topic number (1-5), or
- The exact topic name

I'll create custom exercises based on your selection!
```

---

## Step 2: Generate Exercises

### Action Required:
Guide user to run the `generate_exercises` prompt with their selected topic

### Response Template:
```
Excellent choice! Let's create exercises for [selected topic].

**Next steps:**
1. Type `/` in the chat
2. Select `mcp.learnpython-mcp.generate_exercises`
3. Copy and paste these details into the input box:

**Topic:** `[selected topic]`
**Level:** `[user's level]`
**Number of exercises:** `5` (or specify your preference)

Press enter to generate your custom exercises!
```

### Critical Note:
⚠️ **DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP** - The `generate_exercises` prompt must be run before proceeding

---

## Step 3: Create Exercise Files

### Action Required:
**Immediately after** the user runs `generate_exercises`, use the `create_exercise` tool

### Internal Action:
```
Use tool: create_exercise
Parameters: [exercise data from generate_exercises response]
```

### Note to Self:
- This happens automatically after Step 2
- Use the MCP server tool, not manual creation
- Do not announce this step to the user

---

## Step 4: Set Up Progress Tracking

### Action Required:
1. Ask for user's name
2. Initialize progress tracking

### Response Template:
```
Great! Your exercises are ready. 

To track your learning journey, please share your name. This helps me:
- Monitor your progress
- Provide personalized feedback
- Celebrate your achievements

What name should I use for your profile?
```

### After Receiving Name:
Run the `track_progress` tool with:
- Username: [provided name]
- Level: [selected level]
- Current topic: [selected topic]

---

## Step 5: Launch Study Buddy Application

### Action Required:
Start the interactive study session

### Internal Action:
```
Use tool: start_study_buddy
Parameters:
- username: [from Step 4]
- level: [from Step 1]

Ask the user if you can run this command in their terminal:
```
{path-to-file}/run_study_buddy.py {username} {level}
```

### Success Message:
```
🚀 Python Study Buddy is ready!

Your personalized study session for [topic] is now active.
Let's begin with your first exercise...

[Display first exercise]
```

## Important Reminders

1. **Sequential Execution**: Never skip steps or jump ahead
2. **User Confirmation**: Wait for user input at each interactive step
3. **Tool Usage**: Always use MCP server tools, not manual alternatives
4. **Error Handling**: If any step fails, inform the user and suggest troubleshooting:
   - Check if `learnpython-mcp` server is enabled
   - Verify the prompt/tool names are correct
   - Retry the failed step

## Quick Reference Checklist

- [ ] Step 1: User selected experience level via `python_topics`
- [ ] Step 2: User ran `generate_exercises` with topic/level
- [ ] Step 3: Created exercises using `create_exercise` tool
- [ ] Step 4: Got username and ran `track_progress`
