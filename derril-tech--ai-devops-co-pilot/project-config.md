# Security & Secrets Management

## Security Principles

### Core Security Practices
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default configuration
- **Zero Trust**: Verify all access requests
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security from the start

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Use OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for external auth
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use JWT with proper expiration and refresh tokens
- Implement session management and timeout

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper key management
- Use TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Implement data masking for sensitive information
- Follow data retention and deletion policies

### Secrets Management
- Never store secrets in code or configuration files
- Use environment variables for development
- Implement centralized secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Audit secret access and usage

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement allowlists for accepted values
- Sanitize outputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Implement rate limiting and throttling

### Secure Coding Practices
- Avoid hardcoded credentials
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Use security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Implement CSRF protection
- Validate file uploads and prevent directory traversal

### Infrastructure Security
- Use network segmentation and firewalls
- Implement intrusion detection systems
- Regular security patching and updates
- Container security scanning
- Secure CI/CD pipelines

### Compliance & Auditing
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Maintain audit trails for sensitive operations
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Implement incident response procedures
- Maintain compliance with relevant standards (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)

### Security Monitoring
- Implement security information and event management (SIEM)
- Monitor for anomalous behavior
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Implement security metrics and reporting

### Third-Party Dependencies
- Regularly audit third-party libraries
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities (CVE database)
- Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD
- Use trusted sources for packages
- Maintain software bill of materials (SBOM)

### Security Testing
- Implement SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Use DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Regular penetration testing
- Implement fuzz testing for inputs
- Test security controls and incident response
