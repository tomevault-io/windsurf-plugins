# Claude Orchestration Kit

A toolkit for building Claude Code multi-agent orchestration
setups. Provides design rules, audit skills, a test harness,
and conventions for creating blueprints — `.claude/`
configurations that turn a Claude Code session into a
coordinated multi-agent team. The two included blueprints
are products of this framework, not the whole project.

## Build and Test

This project runs in a Docker container. Install `uv` on
first use — it is required to run the test suite.

```sh
which uv || curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv run pytest blueprints/workflow/tests/ -m static -v
uv run pytest blueprints/autonomous/tests/ -m static -v
```

## Components

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/.claude/rules/` | Design rules for blueprint development (never copied) |
| `/.claude/skills/` | Audit skills: `/blueprint-audit`, `/cache-audit` (never copied) |
| `blueprints/workflow/` | Clarify-first blueprint — user chooses workflow |
| `blueprints/autonomous/` | Autonomous blueprint — plan queue + developer |
| `devcontainer_templates/` | Devcontainer setup for sandboxed agent execution |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | How to develop and extend blueprints |

### workflow

Clarify-first: the lead clarifies the task, writes a plan
(reviewed by the plan-reviewer subagent and approved by
the user), then presents workflow options. The user
chooses: Direct-Review for simple tasks, Develop-Review
(Supervised or Autonomous) for complex ones, or TDD
User-in-the-Loop. 4 team agents (Developer, Test Engineer,
Security Engineer, Reviewer) plus the lead, with two
on-demand subagents launched during planning and TDD
entry: `plan-reviewer` (reviews draft plans before user
presentation) and `test-list` (converts an example
mapping into a minimum required test list). Workflows
defined as separate files — adding one requires no
changes to CLAUDE.md or agents.

### autonomous

Autonomous after clarification: the lead clarifies, writes
a plan, manages a plan queue. For each task, the lead
assesses risk and directs the developer to consult advisors
when warranted. The developer implements, the reviewer
approves, and the lead commits. 4 team agents (Developer,
Reviewer, Test Engineer, Security Engineer) plus the lead
and the `plan-reviewer` subagent (launched before user
plan presentation). The lead stays responsive to the user
during execution.

### devcontainer_templates

Docker Compose-based sandbox for agent execution:
per-checkout volumes for Claude config and shell history,
CPU/memory limits, dual auth mode (`proxy`/`oauth`) via
`CLAUDE_AUTH`, secrets read by the shell instead of Compose,
and a PulseAudio overlay loaded by default. The root
`.devcontainer` is a symlink to the template.

## Conventions

<!-- Agents: add non-obvious project conventions discovered
during work — things a future agent would need to know to
avoid mistakes. One line each. Remove when no longer true. -->

- Two levels of `.claude/`: project-level (`/.claude/`) is tooling for this repo, never copied; blueprint-level (`blueprints/*/.claude/`) gets copied to target projects
- Use "lead" not "orchestrator" — Claude Code's native term for the session that manages the team
- Every directive in blueprint markdown files must include its rationale (see `reasoned-instructions.md` rule)
- Agent files define role and capability only — no named teammates, no workflow-specific coordination (see `agent-design.md` rule)
- Agent `name:` fields in frontmatter use lowercase hyphenated form: `developer`, `test-engineer`
- Use official terminology: "launch" subagents, "spawn" and "shut down" teammates, "message" within teams (see `terminology.md` rule)
- Rule files and CLAUDE.md files target under 200 lines — agent adherence degrades beyond that threshold
- Blueprint files are cached at prompt cache level 3 — no dynamic content (dates, counters, versions)
- Test suite uses pytest with `-m static` marker for structural verification

implementation decisions. One line each. -->

## Session Checklist

Before ending a session that modified blueprint files:

1. Verify all changes are safe, sound, and concise
2. Verify this file (`CLAUDE.md`) still reflects reality
3. Verify root `README.md` matches current blueprints
4. Run `uv run pytest blueprints/<name>/tests/ -m static -v`
