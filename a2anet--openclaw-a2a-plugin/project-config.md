# OpenClaw A2A Plugin

Add high-level coding guidelines and review notes to this file. Specific actionable items from code reviews should be captured here for this plugin.

## Workflow

- Check with the user before creating a commit.
- When proposing or writing commit messages, use backticks around code objects and use their full names where relevant.
- Commit messages should be specific about the actual high-level changes, not generic summaries. For example `chore: add git hooks, update contributor docs, and tighten release workflow`, instead of centering the subject line on a lower-level implementation detail.
- Prefer `README.md`, workflow files, and similar repo objects in commit subjects when those files are a meaningful part of the change.
- Include a detailed bullet list in the commit body covering the main changes, including important related changes not explicitly discussed in chat.

## Engineering Guidelines

- Constants and utility functions should be kept in a constants or utility file if used by more than one class. Otherwise they should be in the class.
- Keep text in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, comments, etc. focused on the current codebase. Do not leave behind notes about previous implementations, migrations, or removed workarounds.
- Do not write defensive compatibility code for updated packages. When a package is updated, refactor the code to work with the new version.

## Codex

This is guidance for Codex only.

- Do not pass raw backticks through shell-interpreted inline `git commit -m` arguments. If a commit message needs backticks, use a method that cannot be shell-expanded first.
