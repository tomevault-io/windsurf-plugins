You are a senior Dart programmer with experience in the Flutter framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## Project precedence (AI_PRG)

When guidance in this file conflicts with repository product or architecture docs, follow the project sources first:

1. `.cursorrules`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/project-context.md`
2. `FlutterRules.md`, `Architecture.md`, `PRD.md`
3. `docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/features/CATALOG.md` and `docs/features/<slug>/` for feature scope — do not remove or gut documented features or intentional stubs without updating those docs.

This `.mdc` is a style and patterns guide aligned with the **actual** AI_PRG stack (see *Specific to Flutter* below).

## Dart General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use underscores_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Target less than 200 instructions, fewer than 10 public methods, fewer than 10 properties.
  - Legacy large types should be split **incrementally** when touched (e.g. extract helpers into separate libraries), not rewritten in one huge PR unless explicitly requested.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to Flutter (AI_PRG stack)

### Layers and layout

- **Feature-first:** `lib/src/features/<feature>/` with `presentation/` (widgets, screens) and `application/` (Riverpod controllers, view state).
- **Shared core:** `lib/src/core/models/`, `repositories/`, `services/`, `data/` — domain models, persistence adapters, orchestration and AI gateway code.
- **App shell:** `lib/src/app/` — bootstrap, `ProviderScope`, theme, localization, responsive helpers.
- Use **repository pattern** for persistence (repositories delegate to storage / local data sources).
- **Controllers:** business and screen orchestration live in Riverpod `StateNotifier` (or similar) classes in `application/`; keep widgets mostly declarative.
- **Domain models** live under `core/models/` (role similar to "entities" in generic clean-architecture wording).

### Dependency injection (no getIt required)

- **Composition root:** `AiRpgApp` constructs `AppDatabase`, repositories, `AiServiceFactory`, `GameEngine`, `PortraitStorage`, and language `ValueNotifier` as needed.
- **Riverpod:** expose shared dependencies via `Provider` definitions in `app_providers.dart` and inject them with `ProviderScope(overrides: buildAppProviderOverrides(...))` at startup.
- **Tests:** override the same providers in tests — do not introduce a second global service locator (e.g. get_it) unless there is a documented team decision.

### State management

- Use **flutter_riverpod** for app and feature state.
- **View state:** prefer immutable `*ViewState` classes with an explicit `copyWith` (manual is fine). **freezed** is optional — use it to reduce boilerplate if the team adopts codegen, not as a mandatory architecture requirement.
- Use `ref.keepAlive` / provider keepAlive only when a provider must survive beyond typical auto-dispose scope (document why).

### Navigation

- For the current app size, **imperative navigation** (`Navigator.of(context).push`, `MaterialPageRoute`) is acceptable and expected.
- Introduce a **declarative router** (e.g. `go_router`, `auto_route`) when there is a concrete need: deep links, web URLs, auth or guard-heavy route trees, or many nested branches. Until then, avoid large router migrations that do not deliver product value.

### UI and theming

- Use **ThemeData** via the app theme module.
- Use **AppLocalizations** / project l10n for user-visible strings; respect ru/en parity per project rules.
- Use **extensions** for small reusable context helpers where appropriate.
- Prefer **const** constructors and flatter widget trees; split large widgets into focused children.

### Testing

- Use Flutter's **widget_test** and project test conventions.
- Add or extend **integration / API-module tests** when changing HTTP or AI contracts.
