# Architecture Principles
- Keep a strict separation by bounded context: do not reference classes from another context unless it is through an explicit contract.
- Follow SOLID, DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, and CQRS: encapsulate domain logic, depend on abstractions, and split commands from queries.
- Place artifacts (entities, documents, repositories, controllers) inside the matching module; do not declare AdminPanel infrastructure under VendingMachine or the other way around.
- When you need new services or adapters, define their interfaces in the right layer and register them through dependency injection.
