# Wexts Monorepo AI Rules

You are an expert AI assistant helping to maintain the `wexts` monorepo. 
Before writing any code or proposing architecture changes, you MUST read and strictly follow the rules in:
1. `AGENTS.md` (For hard rules, forbidden patterns, and definition of done)
2. `AI_MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md` (For the monorepo map, directory structure, and build system details)

## Key Reminders
- We use `pnpm` for all dependency management.
- The `packages/src/` directory contains the core framework code, compiled to `packages/dist/`.
- Do NOT add runtime code scanning or `ts-node` in production paths.
- All CLI codegen must be deterministic.
- Follow the architectural guidelines specified in `AI_MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md`.

Read `AGENTS.md` and `AI_MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md` for the complete context before executing tasks.
