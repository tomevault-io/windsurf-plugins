# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

GodoMaster is a Claude Code skill providing comprehensive Godot 4.x game development intelligence. Based on official Godot documentation, it covers GDScript, scene architecture, 2D/3D rendering, physics, animation, UI, audio, input, shaders, networking, performance, export, and file I/O.

## Architecture

```
.claude/skills/godomaster/     # Skill entry point
├── SKILL.md                  # Main skill (routing + quick reference)
└── references/               # Detailed reference documents
    ├── 01-godot-project-setup.md
    ├── 02-godot-editor-mastery.md
    ├── 03-gdscript-pro.md
    ├── 04-godot-nodes-scenes.md

```

## Sync Rules

**Source of Truth:** `.claude/skills/godomaster/`

When modifying reference files, edit directly in the `references/` directory. The SKILL.md routing table must be updated if references are added or renamed.

**CLI Assets:** Run sync before publishing:

```bash
cp .claude/skills/godomaster/SKILL.md cli/assets/SKILL.md
cp .claude/skills/godomaster/references/*.md cli/assets/references/
cp README.md README.zh-cn.md cli/assets/
```

## Content Guidelines

- All code examples use GDScript (Godot 4.x syntax)
- Follow official Godot naming conventions (snake_case for files, PascalCase for classes)
- Include verification checklists at the end of each reference
- Keep SKILL.md quick reference under 200 lines
- Detailed content goes in reference files

## Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/...` or `fix/...`
2. Commit changes
3. Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
4. Create PR: `gh pr create`
