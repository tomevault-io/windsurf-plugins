# AGENTS.md

## Product

`ai-14all` is an Electron desktop app for managing several local repository-scoped workspaces through a session-first workflow centered on Git worktrees and embedded terminals.

The product is not trying to become a full IDE. V1 is terminal-first, with embedded read-only code and diff inspection to keep the workflow self-contained.

## Workflow Priorities

The product should optimize for one active worktree session at a time within the selected workspace.

Keep these workflow priorities intact:

- the selected worktree session is the main unit of focus
- terminals are the primary interaction surface
- code and Git inspection should stay in the same session workflow
- active branch and worktree context should be hard to miss
- session state should stay simple unless real usage proves otherwise
- agent handoff during review may flow through generic agent-pull surfaces (e.g. local MCP tools the agent calls); the app does not push to vendor APIs

Do not expand the product scope into:

- multi-worktree comparison
- advanced Git operations beyond lightweight review
- editable embedded code workflows

## Architecture Rules

Keep these boundaries intact:

- Renderer is unprivileged and must not access Node APIs directly.
- All privileged operations go through preload and typed IPC.
- Electron main stays thin.
- Durable product logic belongs in services, not React components.
- Shared contracts and shared models are the canonical source of truth across renderer and backend.

The frontend should stay session-first:

- model UI state around worktree sessions
- avoid file-first or terminal-first state shapes that bypass the session model
- terminals, Git review, and local note state should belong to the active worktree session

## Frontend Structure And Naming

Feature code should be organized by feature domain first, then by file role.

Within a feature folder, prefer this shape as the feature grows:

- `components/` for React components
- `hooks/` for React hooks
- `logic/` for app-specific pure logic, reducers, selectors, state builders, and workflow helpers
- `types/` only when feature-local types become large enough to justify separation

Keep filenames visually scannable by role:

- React component files use `PascalCase.tsx` and live under `components/`.
- React hook files use `kebab-case.ts` and live under `hooks/`, even when the exported hook is camelCase.
- Non-component logic files use `kebab-case.ts` and live under `logic/` or an established non-component folder.
- Shared contracts, shared models, services, Electron main/preload files, and utility modules use `kebab-case.ts`.
- Test filenames should match the source filename plus `.test`, and tests should live in a folder that mirrors the source domain when practical.

Avoid mixing component files and non-component modules in the same feature folder once there is more than one role present. A small feature may start flat, but when adding the second role, split it into role folders as part of the same change.

Do not put renderer implementation types into `shared/`. The `shared/` layer must not import from `src/`; move renderer-only state and view models into the relevant feature folder.

### Privileged IPC Trust Boundary

- IPC handlers in `electron/main/ipc.ts` MUST accept identifiers (`workspaceId`, `worktreeId`) and resolve filesystem paths server-side via `WorkspaceRegistryService.get` + `WorktreeService.findWorktree`.
- Raw filesystem paths from the renderer are forbidden in `ipc.ts`. Exception: MCP agent-pull tool surfaces in `services/mcp/` and the `WorktreePathResolver`, where the path is part of the tool's external contract.
- Both resolvers throw on unknown ids — do not add `if (!x)` checks; thrown errors propagate as rejected promises to the renderer.

### Diagnostics Logging

- `ShellEventLogService` runs in one of three modes: `off` (production / packaged builds by default), `sampled` (dev / beta builds — logs 1 of every 50 `terminal-output` events plus the first event of each burst), `full` (every event, expensive under load).
- Override via `AI14ALL_DEBUG=1` (sampled) or `AI14ALL_DEBUG=full` (verbose). Tests requiring complete event logs should construct the service with `mode: "full"` explicitly.
- Sampled mode drops events; do not use diagnostic logs as authoritative state.

### Test File Layout

- New feature-owned tests live under `tests/unit/<domain>/` or `tests/unit/features/<domain>/`, where `<domain>` is the feature folder name (`review`, `workspace`, `terminals`, `viewer`, `git`, `files`, `editor`, `app`).
- Do not add new test files to `tests/unit/components/`. That folder is a legacy catch-all and will be drained opportunistically when its tests' source code is touched.
- Test file names mirror their source: `SessionSidebar.tsx` → `tests/unit/workspace/SessionSidebar.test.tsx`, `use-theme.ts` → `tests/unit/lib/use-theme.test.ts`.
- For pure-logic modules, place the test next to its source domain.

## Product Boundaries

V1 assumptions:

- Electron for the desktop runtime
- multiple repository-scoped workspaces with fast switching
- interactive terminal sessions as the primary workflow
