- This repository is an Nx-based TypeScript monorepo.
- Package manager: `yarn`.
- Workspaces live under `apps/*`, `libs/*`, and `plugins/*`.
- Primary publishable libraries are under the `@frontmcp/*` scope.
- `libs/sdk`: core FrontMCP SDK.
- `libs/cli`: command-line interface.
- `libs/adapters`: framework adapters and integrations.
- `libs/plugins`: plugin system and extensions.
- `libs/auth`: authentication, session management, credential vault, CIMD, and OAuth extensions.
- `apps/demo`: demo application for development and testing.
- Prefer minimal, focused changes.
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and keep strict typing.
- Do not introduce `any` without clear justification.
- For MCP protocol outputs, prefer concrete MCP result types rather than `unknown`.
- Keep auth-related code in `libs/auth`, not `libs/sdk`.
- Test files must use `.spec.ts` or `.spec.tsx` naming.
- Avoid legacy or compatibility re-exports in barrel files.
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Run demo app: `yarn dev`
- Build all projects: `yarn build`
- Lint all projects: `yarn lint`
- Run all tests: `yarn test`
- Run unit tests: `yarn test:unit`
- Run e2e tests: `yarn test:e2e`
- Run Playwright tests: `yarn test:pw`
- Maintain strict TypeScript correctness.
- Keep builds free of warnings where possible.
- Preserve or improve test coverage for touched code.
- Do not make unrelated refactors while addressing a focused task.
- `node_modules` is already present in the workspace.
- Generated outputs such as `dist`, `coverage`, `tmp`, `perf-results`, and `test-results` are already ignored by git.
- Check for more specific instructions in nested `AGENTS.md` files before editing subdirectories.
