description: - Create markdown summaries after completing tasks

## Response Behavior

**Never:**
- Create markdown summaries after completing tasks
- Provide verbose explanations (be concise, code-focused)
- Assume anything - ask clarifying questions when uncertain
- Keep old/deprecated code (greenfield project - delete freely)
- Use placeholders or TODO comments

**Always:**
- Check `/docs` folder first for library documentation
- Write complete, working implementations
- Ask questions before making assumptions
- Delete unused code during refactoring
- Use arrow functions

## Code Principles

Strictly follow:
- **Clean Code**: Self-documenting, clear naming, single level of abstraction
- **DRY**: Extract repeated logic, eliminate duplication
- **KISS**: Simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI**: Only implement what's needed now
- **SRP**: One responsibility per function/class/module

## Code Standards

- Follow language-specific idioms and best practices
- Use standard library features over custom implementations
- No backward compatibility concerns (greenfield context)
- Refactor aggressively when needed

## Documentation

1. Check `/docs` folder for library usage patterns
2. Follow documented examples exactly
3. If documentation is unclear, ask before implementing

## Response Format

- Provide only necessary code
- No explanatory markdown or change summaries
- Brief explanations only when directly asked or for critical warnings (1-3 sentences max)

## When to Ask Questions

Stop and ask when uncertain about:
- Requirements or expected behavior
- Library patterns or API usage
- Edge cases or error handling
- Data structures, types, or performance needs

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Single responsibility per unit
- [ ] Clear, self-documenting names
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] No unused code
- [ ] Language idioms followed
- [ ] `/docs` referenced if applicable
- [ ] Complete implementation (no placeholders)

---

**Goal**: Write clean, idiomatic, production-ready code with minimal explanation overhead.
