# Prompt Engineering Best Practices

## Understanding LLM Token Prediction

### How LLMs Actually Process Prompts

Understanding the mechanics of LLM processing is crucial for effective prompt design:

#### Sequential Token Prediction

- LLMs read left to right, predicting each token based on everything before it
- Early tokens shape all that follows—creating a "first impression" that persists
- Each token's prediction is influenced by ALL previous tokens, creating cascading
  effects

#### Attention Mechanisms

- Earlier tokens receive more attention passes during processing
- The model repeatedly references early context when interpreting later content
- This creates a foundation effect where initial framing heavily influences all
  subsequent reasoning

#### Context Window Effects

- Primacy: Information at the beginning is strongly encoded and influences everything
- Recency: Information near the end is fresh in "working memory" for decisions
- Middle Fade: Information in the middle can get "lost" if not properly structured

#### Priming & Anchoring

- Early statements act as anchors that bias interpretation of everything else
- The model's "persona" crystallizes early and remains consistent throughout
- Initial framing determines the lens through which all data is viewed

### Implications for Prompt Design

SYSTEM PROMPT (Static Foundation) - the agent's DNA:

- Identity First: Who the agent IS fundamentally shapes HOW it thinks
- Core Principles: Unwavering rules or beliefs that guide decisions
- Operational Framework: Methodology for the task
- Capabilities & Constraints: What the agent can and cannot do

USER PROMPT (Dynamic Context) - real-time inputs:

- Current Context: Immediate situation or environment
- Specific Data: The information to process
- Task Request: Clear ask with expected output format

## Pattern Reinforcement Through Examples

LLMs learn patterns from what you show them, regardless of labels.

### How LLMs Process Examples

When you provide code examples, LLMs encode those patterns whether you label them
positively or negatively:

1. Pattern Matching Over Labels: LLMs reproduce structural patterns. Code structure
   creates strong activation in attention. Text labels like "wrong" are weak signals
   that don't override pattern encoding.

2. Training Data Amplification: Patterns frequent in training data get reinforced when
   you show more examples, even if marked unwanted. You're adding to the total times the
   model has seen that pattern.

3. Negation Complexity: Understanding negation requires multiple reasoning steps
   (understand concept, understand negation, invert preference) versus direct
   instruction (understand and apply). Each step adds error probability.

4. Attention Weighting: All tokens in context receive attention. Structural patterns
   activate high attention regardless of surrounding text.

### Writing Effective Instructions

Flood context with desired patterns. Show 5+ examples of the standard approach. If there
are legitimate exceptions, show 1 example clearly marked. Maintain at least 5:1 ratio
favoring the desired pattern.

Describe alternatives in prose rather than showing code. For example: "Keep imports at
file level rather than inside functions" or "Write straightforward code without
defensive attribute checks."

Use positive framing. Frame instructions as "Write code like this" rather than "Avoid
that." Focus on what the model should generate.

Structure for maximum impact:

- Lead with purpose and identity
- Provide 5+ examples of standard patterns
- Add 1-2 examples of rare exceptions if truly needed
- Describe alternatives in prose
- Put most common patterns first

### The Mechanism

This mirrors the "pink elephant effect": to understand what not to think about, the mind
must first construct that thought. LLMs encode patterns they're shown, regardless of
markers like "wrong" or "avoid."

Research shows models trained on positive examples outperform those exposed to negative
examples. Flood the context with desired patterns, minimize or eliminate unwanted
pattern examples, and describe alternatives in prose without code demonstrations.

## Goals Over Process

LLMs are capable of sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving. Trust them to figure
out how to achieve goals rather than prescribing exact steps.

### The Over-Prescription Problem

When prompts become overly prescriptive, they:

- Waste tokens on process details the LLM can figure out
- Create brittle instructions that fail when context changes
- Treat the LLM as a script executor rather than an intelligent agent
- Add excessive formatting (numbered steps, nested bullets, bold headers) that doesn't
  help the LLM understand the goal

### Writing for Intelligence

Focus on WHAT needs to happen, not HOW to do it:

```
❌ Over-prescriptive:
Step 1: Check if file exists
  - If exists:
    a. Use diff to compare
    b. If identical, skip
    c. If different:
       i. Analyze differences
       ii. Ask user for decision
  - If doesn't exist:
    a. Copy directly

✓ Goal-focused:
Before copying files, check if they already exist. If they do, use diff to compare them.
If identical, skip it. If different, show what changed and ask the user what they want
to do.
```
