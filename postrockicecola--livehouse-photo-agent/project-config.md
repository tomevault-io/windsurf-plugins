description: Short replies + when to load Livehouse project rule
---


# Session defaults (token-aware)

- Default to **concise** answers; bullets or short sections unless the user asks for depth.
- Do **not** paste large code already in context; use ```startLine:endLine:path``` citations or tiny snippets.
- Prefer **@ single files** over folders or whole-repo context when locating code.

# This workspace

- When working on this repo’s **Python / TypeScript / Go / YAML** (or the user clearly means this codebase), apply `.cursor/rules/livehouse.mdc` (stack, paths, minimal edits, VLM/schema).
