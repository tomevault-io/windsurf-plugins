## Coding Agent Instructions

- **Explicitly state the rule(s)** you're applying in each output. Use concise phrases to indicate applied rules
- **When uncertain**, ask a series of concise, yes/no clarifying questions (maximum once per interaction)
- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.


## Project Context
Eloka SaaS Web App: Multi-tenant, white-labeled platform for Admins to manage agent networks handling financial transactions.

Admin features:
- Agent onboarding, KYC, analytics
- Fintech product config (enable/disable, toggles, integrations)
- Flexible pricing/commissions per agent/product/tier
- Custom branding (domain, name, logo, color, landing page)
- Wallet ops, reconciliation, monitoring

Agent features:
- Self-registration, KYC, verification
- Financial transactions
- Wallet: top-up, withdraw, balance, history
- Issue/ticketing system

(Core: Admin manages agents & products; agents transact & manage wallets. Customizable, analytics, compliance, and support built-in.)


## Code Standards

### Required Before Each Commit
- Run `npm run lint` to ensure code follows project standards.
  - Run `npm run lint:error` for to only check for and fix errors.
- Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and reflects the latest changes made to the codebase
- Make sure that the repository structure documentation is correct and accurate in the Copilot Instructions file
- Ensure all tests pass by running `npm run test:quick` in the terminal
  - In case of errors in unit tests, run `npm run test:error` to only re-run failed tests in order to fix them.

### TypeScript and React Patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces/types for all props and data structures. Preferred interface over types.
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Use proper state management techniques
- Components should be modular and follow single-responsibility principle
- Use absolute imports for components and utilities (e.g., `import Button from 'components/Button'`)
- Avoid Enums: Use constant objects with `as const` assertion.
- Explicit return types on all functions/components.

### Coding Style
- Write **concise, self-explanatory TypeScript** code with accurate examples.
- Prefer **functional and declarative patterns**; avoid OOP and classes.
- Use **modular and reusable functions** to minimize duplication.
- **Descriptive, semantic naming** for variables/functions (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- For conditional rendering, prefer **ternary operators** over && and ||.
- Always use **optional chaining** (`?.`) for object properties to avoid null/undefined errors.
- Use **nullish coalescing** (`??`) for default values instead of logical OR (`||`).
- Keep files small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use tabs for indentation consistently across all files.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.

### Performance & Optimization
- Optimize components and pages for performance
- Implement **lazy loading** (dynamic imports) for non-critical components. Eg: `const Component = dynamic(() => import('components/Component'), { ssr: false })`
- Apply appropriate **caching strategies** to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- Ensure proper **cleanup** for event listeners, intervals, and effects (`useEffect` cleanup).

### Styling
- Prefer custom components in the `components` folder over Chakra UI's built-in components (e.g., `components/Button`, `components/Input`, `components/Select`).
- Exclusively use **Chakra UI** for styling and base components where custom components aren't available.
- Use [theme variables](../styles/themes.tsx) for colors, fonts, and spacing.

### File Naming Conventions
- Directories: lowercase with dashes (e.g., `layout-components`)
- Component files: PascalCase (`TextArea.tsx`)
- Utility files: camelCase (`formValidator.ts`)
- Exports: prefer named exports over defaults.
