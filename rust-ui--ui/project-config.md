- **Cargo clippy**: When finishing a task, run clippy scoped to the crate(s) you touched (`cargo clippy -p <crate> --no-deps`), in background, not `--workspace --all-targets` (recompiles every crate across all 3 target profiles: wasm/ios/server, very slow). Only widen to `--workspace --all-targets` if the change touched a public API (signature, struct field, trait) that other crates consume; CI already runs the full workspace check on the PR, so it's a safety net either way. `sccache` is wired globally as `RUSTC_WRAPPER` (user's `~/.cargo/config.toml`, not committed to this repo since it's public) to share compile cache across the wasm/ios/server target profiles. Skip clippy entirely for trivial/CSS-only changes (Tailwind class string edits, comments, formatting) — no need to compile for those.

- **Git hooks**: repo ships a `pre-commit` hook (typos check on staged files, needs `typos-cli`) in `.githooks/`, not auto-enabled by git. Each clone must run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once.

- **Changelog + versioning**: keep `CHANGELOG_DEV.md` up to date (Keep a Changelog format, entries land under `## [Unreleased]`). Semver tags are `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (annotated tags, current: `v0.1.0`), separate from the `deploy_prod_v2_*` timestamp tags. When `[Unreleased]` has grown enough to be worth cutting, tell me and propose the next version, then wait for me to confirm before renaming the section, tagging, and pushing.


### Memory

- Don't use Claude Code auto-memory for this project. Project knowledge/learnings live in `__SKILLS_LEARNINGS/LEARNINGS.md` (Confirmed + Inbox sections) — read it for context, write new entries there per the Self improving rule below.

### Self improving 

- When I correct a behavior/pattern/preference (not a one-off fact) and you judge it will recur, append one bullet under `## Inbox` in `__SKILLS_LEARNINGS/LEARNINGS.md` (`YYYY-MM-DD [domain] avoid X, do Y, because Z`) and mirror it to auto-memory as `feedback`. You decide, no keyword. Then print: `📝 learning saved: "<one-line>" (say "drop it" to undo)`. Skip: project trivia, anything already enforced by lint/tsconfig/biome/CI, low-confidence guesses. `learn this` forces it.
