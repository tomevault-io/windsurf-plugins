# GitHub Copilot / VS Code adapter for Fusebase Flow

Read `AGENTS.md`, then `FLOW_RULES.md` through `## Amendment log`. Copilot supplies no Flow skill bodies: read `flow-skills/communication/SKILL.md`, `flow-skills/role-discipline/SKILL.md`, and `flow-skills/role-discipline/references/<role>.md`. Then read the active workflow and ticket/handoff. Use the attestation and state footer from `FLOW_RULES.md`.

Canonical lifecycle skills, workflows, policies, hooks, templates, provider/runtime precedence, active project context, and update safety are indexed from `AGENTS.md`. Scoped security and validation instructions live in `.github/instructions/`. Copilot has no native Flow lifecycle hooks in this template; use the Git fallback hooks and the same role/approval contract. CLI provider skills remain authoritative for Fusebase Apps runtime, MCP, and SDK behavior.
