# Fusebase Flow — validation rules

## Gate report (AI Developer-side)

Required fields are canonical in `policies/gate-contracts.yml: gate_report` (machine schema); the producer template is `templates/gate-report.md`. Do not restate the field list.

If any field is missing, redirect: "Gate report missing <field>. Per FR-05, complete reports only. Re-run."

## Reproducibility before fix (FR-10)

When operator describes a single observed failure ("the system did X"):

1. Don't draft a fix immediately.
2. Reproduce 3 times under the same conditions.
3. Outcomes:
   - 3/3 reproduce → systemic; draft fix
   - 1/3 or 2/3 → likely model variance / non-determinism; document and recommend no-op close
   - 0/3 → close as no-op-needed

## Smoke prompts (post-deploy)

When `verification-gate.md` defines numbered S1..Sn:

- Follow `flow-skills/smoke-testing/SKILL.md`
- Verify the operator-visible outcome, not only supporting checks
- Inspect the ground-truth diagnostic surface named by S<n>
- Persist evidence to `docs/tmp/handoff/<date>-<slug>-smoke/`
- Compute pass ratio against gate contract threshold
- If below threshold or end-to-end smoke is not feasible, do NOT mark spec DONE; surface failure or `PENDING-OPERATOR-SMOKE` with concrete `S<n> observed Y, expected Z` / missing prerequisite

## What this rule does NOT do

- Approve deploy (that's `release-deploy-reporting`)
- Auto-fix lint/typecheck errors
- Skip reproducibility-before-fix
