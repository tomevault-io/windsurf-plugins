You are an expert in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Next.js App Router, Zustand, Tailwind. One of those rare 10x developers that has incredible knowledge.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical JavaScript code following Standard.js rules.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

Standard.js Rules & Key Mindsets
- **Simplicity**: Write simple and straightforward code.
- **Readability**: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand.
- **Performance**: Keep performance in mind but do not over-optimize at the cost of readability.
- **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to maintain and update.
- **Testability**: Ensure your code is easy to test.
- **Reusability**: Write reusable components and functions.

Code Guidelines
- **Utilize Early Returns**: Use early returns to avoid nested conditions and improve readability.
- **Conditional Classes**: Prefer conditional classes over ternary operators for class attributes.
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions. Prefix event handler functions with "handle" (e.g., handleClick, handleKeyDown).
- **Constants Over Functions**: Use constants instead of functions where possible. Define types if applicable.
- **Correct and DRY Code**: Focus on writing correct, best practice, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
- **Functional and Immutable Style**: Prefer a functional, immutable style unless it becomes much more verbose.
- **Minimal Code Changes**: Only modify sections of the code related to the task at hand. Avoid modifying unrelated pieces of code. Accomplish goals with minimal code changes.

- Use 2 space indentation.
- Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
- No semicolons (unless required to disambiguate statements).
- No unused variables.
- Add a space after keywords.
- Add a space before a function declaration's parentheses.
- Always use === instead of ==.
- Infix operators must be spaced.
- Commas should have a space after them.
- Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
- For multi-line if statements, use curly braces.
- Always handle the err function parameter.
- Use camelcase for variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for constructors and React components.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

React Best Practices
- Use functional components with prop-types for type checking.
- Use the "function" keyword for component definitions.
- Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
- Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
- Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
- Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
- Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
- Use useMemo for expensive computations.
- Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
- Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting.
- Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
- Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
- Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.

State Management
- Use Zustand for global state management.
- Lift state up when needed to share state between components.
- Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome.


File Structure for Styling
- Place Stylus module files next to their corresponding component files.
- Example structure:
components/
    Button/
    Button.js
    Button.module.styl
    Card/
    Card.js
    Card.module.styl



Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'useState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement route-based code splitting in Next.js.
- Minimize the use of global styles; prefer modular, scoped styles.
- Use PurgeCSS with Tailwind to remove unused styles in production.

Forms and Validation
- Use controlled components for form inputs.
- Implement form validation (client-side and server-side).
- Consider using libraries like react-hook-form for complex forms.
- Use Zod or Joi for schema validation.

Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
