# Claude Code instructions for `consort`

This repo is the Lakebase-backed application development kit. See [`README.md`](README.md) for the consumer-facing surface and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for maintainer docs.

## Standard project layout for kit-scaffolded projects

Every project created with `lakebase-create-project` gets two top-level scaffolds:

- **`scripts/`** – kit-provided substrate (consumed via git URL pin in the project's package.json).
- **`.sftdd/`** – TDD workflow state read and written by `consort`. Layout: `features/<F>/`, `experiments/<F>/<exp>/`, `spikes/<slug>/`, `synthesis/<F>/`, `cycles/<F>/<S>/<AC>/`, `selection-log.md`, `smells.json`, `workflow-state.json`. See [`templates/sftdd-bootstrap/.sftdd/README.md`](templates/sftdd-bootstrap/.sftdd/README.md) for the canonical reference.

The `.sftdd/` directory is created at scaffold time by `layDownTddScaffold()` in `scripts/lakebase/create-project.ts`. Pass `enableTdd: false` to opt out.

## When working in this repo

- Substrate scripts live in `scripts/<domain>/` (lakebase, github, git, tdd, util).
- Workflow-domain skills live in `skills/<domain>/SKILL.md`. The kit-authored workflow domain is `consort` (the SFTDD framework). The SCM skill `lakebase-scm-workflows` is owned by the substrate (`@databricks-solutions/lakebase-scm-utils`) and deployed from there. Shared-canon skills: `software-design-principles`, `architectural-design-principles`, `ui-ux-design-principles`. Vendored devhub skills also live under `skills/`.
- Templates ship under `templates/`. Treat them as project assets – they end up in scaffolded projects, not in the substrate itself.
- BDD tests live in `tests/bdd/`. Hermetic by default; live tiers gate on `LAKEBASE_TEST_E2E=1` + `DATABRICKS_HOST`.

When editing scripts, always run `npm run typecheck` before committing. When adding skills or references under `skills/`, regenerate `manifest.json` via `python3 scripts/skills.py`.

## When proposing changes

Follow `consort` for spec-driven, test-driven development on Lakebase-paired projects. Two lanes: the design lane is **Spec Driven Development (SDD)** (`/design`: spec → architectural review → test list → design-spec gate) and the build lane is **Test Driven Development (TDD)** (`/build`: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycles). SDD freezes the spec at the `spec` + `test_list` gates; TDD only builds once they pass. The orchestrator is a deterministic driver (`lakebase-sftdd-drive`), not an LLM agent: it routes phase transitions over `workflow-state.json`, spawns the role agents, and surfaces bad smells. Every gate is HITL.

For non-TDD work in this substrate repo itself, follow the conventions in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md): tier 1 hermetic tests required, tier 2 live tests for `scripts/lakebase/*` changes, single-seam credential rules enforced by CI grep guards.
