# YouOS — Personal Email Copilot

YouOS is a full local Python app (not an instruction-only snippet). It drafts email replies in your style, grounded in your real past replies.

**Naming:** *YouOS* is the shared app/package. During setup it personalizes its name to *<First>OS* (e.g. **BaherOS**) for **your local instance** at `YOUOS_DATA_DIR=~/YouOS-Instances/<you>/` — that's a local config/data directory, not a fork of the project.

## Safety & impact

Read these before installing:

- **Sensitive data ingested locally.** YouOS reads your Gmail (sent + threads), Google Docs, and optional WhatsApp exports into a local SQLite DB. This stays on your machine, but it *is* sensitive content — protect the data directory (`YOUOS_DATA_DIR/var/youos.db`) accordingly.
- **Installation runs local package code.** `./scripts/install.sh` builds a `.venv` and installs this repository — review the source (especially `scripts/install.sh`, `pyproject.toml`, `app/`) before running.
- **Background persistence is opt-in.** YouOS only runs as a launchd LaunchAgent if you explicitly run `youos service install`. Foreground `youos serve` does not persist.
- **Scheduled/nightly runs are opt-in.** Ingestion, fine-tuning, and autoresearch only run automatically if you've enabled the nightly pipeline; `youos improve` is the manual equivalent.
- **External model fallback is optional.** Drafting is on-device by default. Cloud fallback only fires if `review.draft_model` or `model.fallback` is set to a cloud model — set `model.fallback: none` and `review.draft_model: local` for strict local-only operation.

## Install and runtime model

- Install is **manual**: run `./scripts/install.sh` (Python 3.11+) — it creates a `.venv`, installs YouOS, sets up the on-device model (**MLX**) on Apple Silicon, and runs the doctor
- Note: this executes local package install code from this repository; review source before installing
- Requires `python3` (3.11+) and a Google ingestion backend — `gog` (default), `gws`, or native (see Credentials)
- Drafts run on your **fine-tuned local model by default** (Qwen + your LoRA, served warm); the cloud is only a cold-start before your model is trained, or a fallback
- Optional runtime path override: `YOUOS_DATA_DIR`

## Credentials and configuration

- Required: a Google ingestion backend for Gmail/Docs — `gog` (default), `gws`, or native (`youos[google]` + OAuth); set `ingestion.google_backend`
- Optional: Claude CLI/API credentials only for the cold-start/fallback (`review.draft_model` / `model.fallback`)
- For strict local-only: set `review.draft_model: local` and `model.fallback: none`

## Trigger phrases

- "draft a reply to this email"
- "write this email for me"
- "how would I respond to this"
- "what would I say to"
- "help me reply"
- "draft in my style"
- "youos"
- "my email copilot"
- "email copilot"
- "my copilot"
- "generate a draft"
- "reply draft" / "email draft" / "draft reply"
- "compose reply"
- "write a response"
- "email response"
- "how do I usually reply to"
- "reply to this"
- "help me write"
- "write an email"
- "compose a response"
- "email assistant"
- "my writing style"
- "train on my emails"
- "anything important in my inbox"
- "triage my email"
- "what did the agent do"
- "push to gmail drafts"
- "dismiss as noise"
- "save as a training pair"

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4) with 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended) — the local model runs on MLX (`./scripts/install.sh` sets it up)
- Python 3.11+
- A Google ingestion backend for Gmail/Docs: [gog CLI](https://github.com/openclaw/gog) (default), Google's `gws` CLI, or the native Google API (`youos[google]` + OAuth)
- ~5GB free disk space
- Run the UI locally by default (do not expose publicly unless intentionally secured)

## Quick start

```bash
# Install (creates .venv, installs YouOS + MLX on Apple Silicon, runs the doctor)
cd youos
./scripts/install.sh
source .venv/bin/activate

# Check system requirements (Python, Google backend, MLX, disk space, etc.)
youos doctor

# Run setup wizard (identity, ingestion, style analysis) — or open /welcome in the browser
youos setup

# Draft a reply (uses your local fine-tuned model by default)
youos draft "paste inbound email here"
youos draft --sender john@company.com "email text"

# Run the web UI (then open /feedback, /stats, /settings, /about)
youos serve
youos service install     # or run it as a background service (starts at login)

# Compare the backends on YOUR mail, ranked by how closely each sounds like you
youos compare-models --limit 30 --semantic

# Warm local-model server (loaded once for fast drafting)
youos model server status

# Check status / view stats
youos status
youos stats

# Run the nightly pipeline manually (add --verbose for step-by-step output)
youos improve --verbose

# Golden benchmark (10 curated cases)
youos eval --golden

# Full corpus health report (pairs, quality scores, top senders)
youos corpus

# Ingest a WhatsApp chat export (optional — augments your corpus)
youos ingest --whatsapp ~/Downloads/WhatsApp-Chat.txt

# Add a sender note (immediately rebuilds their profile)
youos note john@company.com "integration partner, prefers bullet points"

# Submit a feedback pair directly from the terminal
youos feedback --inbound "email text" --reply "your reply" --rating 4
