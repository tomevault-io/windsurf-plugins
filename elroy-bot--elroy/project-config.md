- **Run specific test**: `just test <test_path>`
- **Build**: `just build` (NOT `python -m build` or similar)
- **Lint**: `just lint`
- **Format**: `just format`

## Review guidelines

Use `CODE_REVIEW.md` as the source of truth for code review expectations in this repository.

During review:
- Apply the role, dependency, and validation rules defined in `CODE_REVIEW.md`
- Do not duplicate or invent competing review standards in review comments
- Treat `just lint`, `just typecheck`, and `just test` as required validation before code is ready for review. Do NOT ignore failures even if they are pre-existing


## Project Roadmap

Reference `ROADMAP.md` for current priorities, and update it when completing roadmap items or adding new ones.
