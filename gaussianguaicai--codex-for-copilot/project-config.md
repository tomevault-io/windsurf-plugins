# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

The extension source lives in [`src/`](src/). Key modules are:
- `config.ts`: reads and normalizes extension settings
- `convertMessages.ts`: adapts VS Code chat messages into Responses input and compares conversation history
- `extension.ts`: VS Code activation and command registration
- `models.ts`: model discovery and provider metadata
- `provider.ts`: language model provider surface and runtime model availability
- `responseBranchStore.ts`: compatible `previous_response_id` branch reuse
- `responsesClient.ts`: shared Responses request builder plus HTTP/WebSocket streaming transport facade
- `secrets.ts`: credential selection across the Codex auth manager, `~/.codex/auth.json`, and SecretStorage
- `auth/`: imported Codex credential storage, refresh, locking, JWT parsing, and request authentication

The extension manifest declares the `codex-for-copilot` AuthenticationProvider under `contributes.authentication`; its ID and label must match the runtime registration in `src/extension.ts`.

Compiled output is written to `out/` and should be treated as build artifacts. Tests live in `test/`. Workspace debug helpers are in `.vscode/`.

Transport-related constraints that must not break:
- `codexModelProvider.transport` defaults to `auto`, which means WebSocket-first with HTTP fallback.
- HTTP and WebSocket transports must emit the same provider-facing callbacks for text, reasoning, tool calls, completion, and failure.
- ChatGPT/Codex custom headers for WebSocket requests are passed via the WebSocket constructor options, not via OpenAI client `defaultHeaders`.
- The runtime now depends on the `ws` package because `openai/resources/responses/ws` requires it outside the SDK bundle.
- `auto` fallback is limited to transport availability failures. Structured WebSocket API errors must be surfaced without an HTTP retry.
- WebSocket sessions may be reused, but concurrent requests must never share an in-use socket.
- Responses branch reuse requires append-only history and an identical request envelope. Model, instructions, tool definitions, or tool schema changes must bust reuse.

Account-usage constraints that must not break:

- Compact account-usage display is driven by fields returned from the usage endpoint, not by guessed plan names or fixed window assumptions.
- A complete workspace Credit budget takes compact-display precedence; unselected Credit budgets and rate-limit windows remain available in the details tooltip.
- `rate_limit_reset_credits` is a reset-credit count, not a workspace Credit balance or budget.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install`: install dependencies
- `npm run check`: run TypeScript type-checking only
- `npm run compile`: type-check and bundle `src/extension.ts` into `out/extension.js`
- `npm run test:smoke`: verify request shape and streaming against a local mock server
- `npm run test:real-backend`: verify the extension request path against the ChatGPT Codex backend using local auth. Set `CODEX_TEST_MODEL` and `CODEX_TEST_SERVICE_TIER` to probe a single model or service tier.
- For transport probes, set `CODEX_TEST_TRANSPORT` to `http`, `websocket`, or `auto`; set `CODEX_TEST_CONTINUATION=1` to exercise `previous_response_id` continuation.

For interactive extension debugging, press `F5` in VS Code and launch the Extension Development Host using `.vscode/launch.json`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use TypeScript with 2-space indentation, semicolons, and single quotes, matching the existing codebase. Prefer small focused modules over large utility files. Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes, and descriptive filenames such as `responsesClient.ts`.

There is no formatter or linter configured here, so keep edits stylistically consistent with neighboring files and run `npm run check` before submitting.

## Testing Guidelines

Add focused tests under `test/` when changing request construction, credential resolution, or VS Code integration points. Name tests by behavior, not implementation detail. Keep mock-based checks in the smoke tests and reserve `test:real-backend` for flows that truly need live backend validation.
For service tier changes, prefer a single real-backend probe with `CODEX_TEST_MODEL` and `CODEX_TEST_SERVICE_TIER` instead of broad runs.
