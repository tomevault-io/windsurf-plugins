# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Writing and Documentation Standards

**IMPORTANT**: When editing ANY text content (documentation, specifications, blog posts, or code comments), you MUST follow the editorial guidelines in `STYLE.md`.

Before finalizing any text, review against the Editorial Checklist in STYLE.md.

## Project Overview

ACS (Agent Control Standard) is the industry standard for building secure, observable AI agents. It delivers three core capabilities:
- **Inspectability**: Complete visibility into agent components and capabilities
- **Traceability**: Full trace trail with reasoning chains
- **Instrumentability**: Hard controls and policy enforcement

## Development Commands

### Documentation Development
```bash
# Serve documentation locally on port 8000
uv run mkdocs serve

# Build documentation static files
uv run mkdocs build
```

### Python Development
```bash
# Install dependencies using UV (preferred)
uv pip install -e .
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Framework Components
The ACS framework consists of three interconnected layers:

1. **Instrument Layer** (Hooks)
   - Real-time control points that allow Guardian Agents to permit, deny, or modify agent actions
   - Hooks fire before actions execute, enabling preventive security
   - Core hooks: `agentTrigger`, `message`, `toolCallRequest`, `knowledgeRetrieval`, `memoryStore`
   - Protocol extensions for A2A and MCP communications

2. **Trace Layer** (Events)
   - Comprehensive event emission for all agent decisions and actions
   - Maps to industry standards: OpenTelemetry for observability, OCSF for security events
   - Enables forensic analysis and compliance auditing
   - Events include full context: reasoning chains, data flows, decision trees

3. **Inspect Layer** (AgBOM)
   - Dynamic Agent Bill of Materials exposing components, models, tools, and dependencies
   - Supports CycloneDX, SPDX, and SWID formats
   - Real-time inventory as agents evolve and add capabilities
   - Critical for supply chain security and compliance

### Key Protocol Concepts
- **Observed Agent**: The AI agent being monitored (implements ACS endpoints)
- **Guardian Agent**: Enforces security policies and observability (consumes ACS data)
- **Session**: Scoped interaction unit from activation to completion
- **Step**: Atomic action/decision within agent reasoning process
- **Hook Response**: Guardian's permit/deny/modify decision with optional mutations

### Protocol Architecture
- **Transport**: HTTP(S) with JSON-RPC 2.0 payload format
- **Core Methods**: 
  - Hooks: `steps/*` methods for runtime control
  - Protocols: `protocols/A2A`, `protocols/MCP` for inter-agent communication
  - Inspection: `agbom/*` methods for component discovery
- **Data Objects**: Standardized schemas for Agent, Tool, Model, Resource definitions
- **Standards Integration**: OpenTelemetry spans, OCSF events, SBOM formats

### Important Files
- `specification/ACS/acs_schema.json`: Complete JSON Schema for ACS protocol
- `docs/spec/instrument/specification.md`: Detailed protocol specification
- `docs/spec/instrument/hooks.md`: Available hooks and their triggers
- `docs/spec/trace/events.md`: Event catalog and schemas
- `docs/topics/core_concepts.md`: Fundamental concepts and terminology
- `docs/topics/ACS_in_action_example.md`: Step-by-step implementation example
- `mkdocs.yml`: Documentation site configuration

### Navigation Structure
The documentation follows this hierarchy:
- **Topics**: High-level concepts and examples
- **Specification**: Technical details divided by layer (Instrument/Trace/Inspect)
- **Implementation Guides**: How to extend existing protocols (MCP, A2A, OpenTelemetry, OCSF)

### Development Setup
This is a documentation-focused project built with:
- **UV** for Python dependency management (replaces pip)
- **MkDocs Material** for local documentation preview

### Hosting (decoupled from this repo)
This repository is the **source of truth for the ACS spec** (schema, hooks, events, AgBOM definitions, written specification). The marketing and docs site at **agentcontrolstandard.ai** is built and deployed independently from a separate repository — changes here do not propagate automatically. The `.org` and `.com` domains redirect to `.ai`.

### Roadmap Context
- **v0.1** (Current): Documentation, schemas, and requirements
- **v1**: Reference implementations of instrumentation and Guardian Agent
- **v2**: Full AgBOM implementation with standard mappers
- **v3**: Extended protocol support for A2A/MCP deny/modify operations
