# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

ActPlane is an **OS-enforced harness for AI agents**. It compiles a policy DSL
to an in-kernel eBPF enforcer that performs **labeled information-flow control**
across process / file / network edges and reports **only** rule violations —
each with a human-readable reason (the corrective-feedback payload). It enforces
below the tool layer (at the syscall boundary), so constraints hold across any
tool, subprocess, or direct syscall the agent uses. (The mechanism is a labeled,
runtime form of information-flow control — unlike classic taint analysis, which
is single-bit, usually offline, and aimed at finding vulnerabilities. Code-level
identifiers still use `taint` — `taint.h`, `taint_config`, `te_*` — as the
implementation name.)

The repo descends from AgentSight (an eBPF observability framework); the SSL/HTTP
analyzer chain, runners, web server, and frontend were removed. What remains is the
labeled information-flow enforcer plus a minimal Rust compiler/driver.

## Agent behavioral constraints (ActPlane-enforced)

When acting as an agent in this repo, **do not run `git branch` or `git worktree`** —
the user does not want new branches or worktrees created right now. **Other git
operations are allowed** (`git commit`, `git add`, `git status`, `git log`, `git push`,
…). If you think a different branch is needed, ask the user instead of creating one.

`git branch` and `git worktree` are also enforced below the tool layer by ActPlane
itself (`actplane.yaml`, rule `no-git-branch`, `@arg "branch"`/`@arg "worktree"`): they
are killed whether invoked via a tool call, `bash -c`, or a subprocess — a worked
example of a real corpus-derived guardrail in the taint DSL.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
make                                    # build bpf/ then collector/
make test                               # bpf C unit tests + collector Rust tests
sudo bash test/e2e_examples.sh          # live enforcement of all 12 examples (E1–E12)

# individual components
make -C bpf                             # eBPF programs + loaders
make -C bpf test                        # C unit tests (test_taint)
cd collector && cargo build --release   # Rust compiler/driver (-> target/release/actplane)
cd collector && cargo test              # DSL compiler tests
cd collector && cargo test <name>       # a single test

make -C bpf debug                       # AddressSanitizer build of the loaders
```

## Running

```bash
# compile + enforce a policy
sudo ./collector/target/release/actplane policy.dsl

# compile only -> kernel config blob
./collector/target/release/actplane policy.dsl --out policy.bin

# run the kernel enforcer directly against a compiled blob
sudo ./bpf/process --config policy.bin
```

Requires `sudo` (or `CAP_BPF` + `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) and a recent kernel (5.8+,
developed on 6.15).

## Architecture

```
policy.dsl ─▶ collector (Rust) ─▶ struct taint_config ─▶ eBPF engine ─▶ TAINT_VIOLATION (+reason)
              parse + lower          (rodata blob)         propagate,
                                                           match, detect
```

### Kernel (`bpf/`)

- `taint.h` — the rule **ABI** (shared, byte-for-byte, with the Rust compiler) and
  the matching predicates. Structs: `taint_source`, `taint_rule`, `taint_xform`,
  `taint_gate`, `taint_config`. Enums: `taint_match` (EXACT/PREFIX/SUFFIX/ANY),
  `taint_src_kind`, `taint_op` (EXEC/OPEN/WRITE/CONNECT), `taint_cond`
  (NONE/LINEAGE/AFTER/TARGET). Matchers: `taint_streq/prefix/suffix/match`,
  `taint_mask_ok`, `taint_arg_match`.
- `taint_engine.bpf.h` — engine state + `te_*` helpers. Maps: `ts_proc`
  (pid → labels + lineage gates), `ts_root`, `ts_sess`, `ts_file` (fnv1a(path) →
  labels), `ts_endp` (IPv4 → labels). Rodata rule tables filled by the loader.
- `process.bpf.c` — the hooks (fork/exec/exit/open/unlink/rename/connect). The only
  output channel is `emit_violation()`.
- `process.c` — loader: `--config` reads the blob into rodata, attaches, prints
  `TAINT_VIOLATION` as NDJSON.

### Collector (`collector/src/`)

- `main.rs` — driver: read policy → `dsl::compile_str` → temp blob → spawn loader →
  parse `Violation` lines → `report()` with the reason. `--feedback-file` appends
  the §6 corrective-feedback payload for each kernel-detected violation (channel
  a1 reason file the agent reads on EPERM).
- `feedback.rs` — `format_payload`: turns a kernel-detected violation (rule meta +
  target) into the model-facing §6 corrective-feedback string. No userspace
  re-detection — the kernel is the sole detector. Agent integration: `script/agent-feedback.md`.
- `dsl/` — `ast.rs`, `parse.rs` (lexer + recursive-descent), `lower.rs` (`#[repr(C)]`
  mirrors of the C structs + `compile()`: bit allocation, `dnf()` label-expr
  expansion, glob lowering), `mod.rs` (`compile_str` + tests E1–E12).
- `binary_extractor.rs` — embeds `bpf/process` via `include_bytes!`, extracts at
  runtime so `actplane` is self-contained.

### Labeled information-flow model

Each node carries a `u64` label mask. Sources add labels (exec comm / file path /
