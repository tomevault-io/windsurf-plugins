# monmap conventions

Rules that every package in this monorepo must follow.

**Before writing a query or UI view against the handbook data**, skim
[`docs/handbook-internals.md`](docs/handbook-internals.md) — it
captures the non-obvious shape of Monash's data (CourseLoop field
conventions, what the tree JSONB looks like, fields that silently
lie about their content, cross-year references) that won't be
apparent from the schema or the column names alone.

## 1. `.env` lives at the repository root

There is exactly one `.env` file, at the repo root. Packages do **not** ship
their own `.env` or read from `packages/*/`. Anything that needs env vars
(drizzle config, the ingest CLI, future web servers) must resolve the
root `.env` explicitly — e.g.:

```ts
import { config } from "dotenv";
import { resolve } from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";

config({
  path: resolve(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), "../../../.env"),
});
```

If a new package needs a new env var, add it to the root `.env` (and its
documented `.env.example`), never fragment configuration across packages.

## 2. Drizzle: generate + migrate, never push

The workflow is:

```bash
pnpm db:generate      # write a new SQL migration file to packages/db/drizzle/
pnpm db:migrate       # apply pending migrations to the database in DATABASE_URL
```

`drizzle-kit push` is **not** available as a script and must not be added.
Push bypasses the migration history — great for throwaway prototypes,
disastrous for a shared dev/prod DB where you want an auditable log of
every schema change. Always go through a reviewed migration file.

## 3. Never start the Next.js dev server yourself

The user runs `pnpm dev` themselves. Don't spawn it, don't background it,
don't "just smoke-test it" — `next dev` holds a lockfile at
`packages/webapp/.next/dev/lock`, and a second instance fights the
user's instance over the port and the lock, leaves orphaned processes,
and corrupts the build cache. If you need to verify a route, ask the
user to hit it (or to share the response), or write a unit test. Same
applies to `next start` and any other long-running server.

## 4. Yellow surfaces pair with `text-primary-foreground`, never `text-primary`

`--primary` is Monash yellow (`#ffe330`). Yellow text on a yellow tint
(`bg-primary/15 text-primary` and friends) is unreadable. The brand
defines `--primary-foreground` as `#1d1300` ("yellow ink") for exactly
this pairing — use it on any yellow-tinted chip, badge, or pill, and
bump the tint (≈`/40`) so the surface still reads as yellow rather
than gray.
