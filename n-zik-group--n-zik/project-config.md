# AI Agent Guidelines — NZik

**MANDATORY: Read this file AND rules/\*.md before any task. Compliance for ENTIRE session.**

## Session Startup

1. Read this file entirely
2. Read all rules/\*.md files
3. Ask user via question tool: "Bug, feature, or something else?"

---

## Critical Rules (Agents Consistently Miss These)

### Code Placement

- **NEW code** → `app.n_zik.android.*` ONLY
- **NEVER** create files under `app.it.fast4x.rimusic.*` or `app.kreate.android.*` (legacy, read-only)
- **NEVER** edit `values-*/strings.xml` — only `values/strings.xml`

→ See rules/CODE.md for full file placement table

### Build & Test

- `./gradlew :ComposeN-Zik:assembleDebug` — primary dev build
- `./gradlew :ComposeN-Zik:testDebugUnitTest --tests "app.n_zik.android.SomeTest"` — single test
- `./gradlew :ComposeN-Zik:test` — all tests
- ALWAYS verify build passes after changes
- HALT after 3 failed build attempts
- New features/bug fixes should include at least one test

→ See rules/BUILD.md for build types, commit convention, version catalog, testing patterns

### NEVER (Hard Stops)

- Commit without human testing and explicit approval
- Skip BMAD workflow steps
- **Write code before completing full BMAD workflow (even if user suggests a fix)**
- Edit database schema without explicit instruction

→ See rules/WORKFLOW.md for full NEVER/HALT lists, rules/SECURITY.md for security rules

### BMAD Workflow — Mandatory

**Loading a BMAD skill ≠ Completing the workflow.** You MUST follow the skill's workflow from first step to last step, in order, without skipping.

**Before writing ANY code:** verify you have completed EVERY step of the loaded BMAD skill's workflow. If any step is incomplete → HALT, do NOT write code.

User suggestions are input to the workflow, NOT a shortcut to skip it.

**Enforcement — before starting the workflow:**

1. Read the skill's SKILL.md file — **EVERY line, NOT just step headers**
2. Count the total number of steps in the `<workflow>` section
3. List all steps: "Steps: 1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z, ..."
4. List all `<template-output>` tags per step (what to produce)
5. List all `<energy-checkpoint>` tags (when to ask for breaks)
6. List all checkpoint instructions (what options to present)
7. Announce: "BMAD workflow has N steps. Starting step 1."

**Enforcement — during the workflow:**

- Before each action, announce: `[BMAD Step X/N: <step name>]`
- Before moving to next step, ask user: "Step X complete. Proceed to step Y?"
- Before implementing, verify: "All N steps complete. Ready to implement?"
- If you cannot name the current step → HALT, you are lost

→ See rules/WORKFLOW.md for full BMAD workflow enforcement

### IDE Selection — One at a Time

When asking which IDE/tool the user is using, **ask ONE option at a time** using the question tool. Skill path depends on the IDE.

**Order of IDE options:** OpenCode first, then Google Antigravity, then other preferred tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex).

→ See rules/BMAD-TOOLS.md for IDE skill directories

## BMAD Method

This project uses BMAD for structured AI-assisted development.

- **Bugs** → `bmad-cis-problem-solving`, then `bmad-code-review`
- **Additions** → `bmad-quick-dev`
- AGENTS.md wins on: code quality, security, commits, logging, database, build
- BMAD wins on: workflow ordering, templates, checkpoints
- BOTH apply in parallel — if conflict, AGENTS.md wins

→ See rules/BMAD.md for installation, config resolution. See rules/WORKFLOW.md for step-by-step workflow.

---

## Communication

- Code comments & commits: English
- User communication: match user's language
- ALL user questions via question tool (never plain text)
- Show evidence (diffs, test output) — never just claim "done"
