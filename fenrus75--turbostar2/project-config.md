# TurboStar editor

Top design documentation: `docs/design.md`


# Project specific rules

- keep `docs/design.md` and related documents updated at all times. Update the specific documentation files listed in the "Documentation Files" section whenever architectural or structural changes occur.
- when adding a new `.cpp` source file, you MUST update `meson.build` and `src/meson.build`. A common mistake is to add it to the main `turbostar` target but forget to add it to the `agentcli_sources` list or relevant unit test targets.
- git commit after each logical change or item implemented. This is a standing rule.
- **CRITICAL**: When adding a new `event_type` enum value (in `src/event_queue.h`), you **MUST** update the central routing switch statement in `editor::dispatch` inside `src/editor_events.cpp` to route the new event to its handler. Since `editor::dispatch` has a `default: break;` case, a missing mapping compiles with NO warnings but silently discards the event at runtime.
- perform a code review before each commit to ensure no stray edits happened
- run the test suite before commit
- when fixing a bug (not: new feature), create a testcase BEFORE fixing the bug; the testcase
    should first fail, and pass once the bug is fixed.
- when splitting a large source file into multiple files, always add a block comment at the top of the original file describing the new files and their general contents to aid discoverability.
- read `.clang-format` on startup
- prefer std::format over string concatinations, and clean up any existing cases as you see them
- the project uses C++23
- each class in a separate .cpp file with a dedicated .h file that is in the same directory as the .cpp file
- add extensive comments to the code when fixing issues, but comment desired/required code behavior, not changes done.
- all `#include ""` should be relative to the `src/` directory (e.g., `#include "fs_utils.h"` or `#include "agentlib/tool_registry.h"` instead of using relative `../../` paths), since `src/` is in the compiler include paths.
- use #pragma ONCE for include guards
- when declaring a mutex in a header file, you MUST add a comment block immediately preceding the declaration explaining: (1) what specific member data or resources the mutex protects, and (2) the general locking rules, lifecycle, or ordering guidelines associated with it.
- when creating a subclass, add or update the header of the parent class with a table that matches this example template:
```c
/*

# subclasses of <parent class>

| subclass     | filename                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | 
| <subclass 1> | <project relative path to the header for subclass 1> |

*/
```
	Check is such comment with table already exists, and add a line when it does.
	When no such comment exists, create a new comment ABOVE the class definition.


## Documentation Files
The `docs/` directory contains crucial context. Keep these files updated as we make changes to the system:

| Filename | Short Description |
|---|---|
| `button-recipe.md` | Guide for implementing Turbo Pascal style UI buttons. |
| `colorscheme.md` | Defines the Turbo Pascal 7 color palette and ncurses pairs. |
| `design.md` | Top-level architectural and design documentation. |
| `design-plugin.md` | Plugin architecture, lifecycles, and tool registration. |
| `file-dialog.md` | Specification for the Turbo Pascal style file dialog. |
| `general-c++.md` | C++20 coding guidelines and rules. |
| `joe-keys.md` | Reference for the "joe" dialect Wordstar keybindings. |
| `keybindings.md` | Complete list of implemented keyboard shortcuts. |
| `release-checklist.md` | Step-by-step checklist for releases and RCs. |
| `sandbox.md` | Details the systemd-based sandboxing and security strategy. |
| `style.md` | C++ coding style guide and formatting conventions. |
| `test-guidelines.md` | Guidelines and best practices for the E2E testing framework. |
| `testcoverage.md` | Guide on generating and reading test coverage reports. |
| `thread-lifecycle.md` | Blueprint for thread management and subprocess teardown. |
| `todo.md` | Short-term task backlog and long-term completed items tracker. |
| `tools.md` | Comprehensive schema and registry of all LLM agent tools. |

## `docs/todo.md` specific rules
- This file is frequently edited by the human.
   - Re-read the file before working on TODO items or evaluating what to
     work on next.
   - Re-read the file after completion of a TODO item.
   - NEVER git checkout / git reset this file
- Move completed items to the Done section.
   - Re-read the todo.md file before doing the edit!
- Add any items deferred during other activities to the short-term section.

# Dependencies
- CLI11 (header-only) for command-line parsing.

# Tooling
- `agentcli` (along with `agentcli_record` and `agentcli_replay` executables) is available to record and replay conversations with the LLM. It is used by the test suite to verify tool execution and agent logic in headless environments without requiring a live network connection to the LLM.
