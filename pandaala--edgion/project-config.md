description: Repository entry rule for Edgion. Keep Cursor aligned with AGENTS.md and the skills-based knowledge map.
---


Use `AGENTS.md` in the repository root as the canonical project instruction file.

When a task needs project-specific context:

1. Start from `skills/SKILL.md`
2. Read only the relevant domain `SKILL.md`
3. Load specific reference files only when needed

Use `docs/` for human-facing background and longer explanations, not as the default full-context source.

Keep Cursor-specific instructions thin here. Project knowledge should stay centralized in `AGENTS.md` and `skills/`.
