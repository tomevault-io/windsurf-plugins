```

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- Hugo (v0.140.0 or newer)
- Node.js (used for syncing content)

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start local development server
hugo server -t hugo-bearblog

# Or, using Makefile
make dev

# Production build
hugo --gc --minify --config hugo.toml

# Clean up build files
hugo --gc
```

### Content Management

Content is maintained in a separate Obsidian vault and synced to this repository:

```bash
# Install sync dependencies
cd scripts && npm install

# One-time sync
cd scripts && npm run sync:once

# Watch for changes
cd scripts && npm run sync:watch
```

Posts are organized by year/month in `content/blog/YYYY-MM/` with:
- Hugo front matter (title, date, tags)
- Markdown content + image links
- Tags

### Publishing Workflow

```bash
# Full publish workflow: sync, autocommit, push, and monitor deployment
make publish
```

This command will:
1. Sync Obsidian notes
2. Auto-generate a commit message using Gemini
3. Commit and push changes
4. Monitor Netlify deployment progress

## Deployment

### Netlify Settings
- **Build Command**: `hugo --gc --minify --config hugo.toml`
- **Publish Directory**: `public/`
- **Hugo Version**: `0.140.0`

### Environment Variables
- `PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN` - For 404 notifications
- `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` - For 404 notifications

## Key Components

### 1. Content Sync System
Located in `scripts/sync-obsidian-notes.js`, this Node.js script:
- Syncs content from an Obsidian vault
- Converts Obsidian markdown to Hugo-compatible format
- Automatically copies images to `static/images/`

### 2. 404 Tracking Serverless Function
Located in `netlify/functions/track-404.mjs`, this function:
- Receives 404 page hits via POST requests
- Sends real-time notifications to Pushover
- Captures client IP, location, device type, and user agent

### 3. Custom Layouts
Override theme templates via `layouts/`:
- `layouts/_default/baseof.html`
- `layouts/partials/`
- `layouts/shortcodes/`

## Development Conventions

1. **Content Organization**: Posts are grouped by year/month: `content/blog/YYYY-MM/`
2. **Front Matter**: Each post includes Hugo front matter with title, date, and tags
3. **Image Handling**: Images are automatically copied to `static/images/` during sync
4. **Customization**: Override theme templates via the `layouts/` directory
5. **Analytics**: Privacy-first analytics with Umami and PostHog

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test with `hugo server`
5. Submit a pull request
