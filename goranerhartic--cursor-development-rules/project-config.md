description: Quick-start playbook for rule discovery - first-run steps, task-to-rule shortcuts, and fallback when project context is missing.

# Quick Start

Use this file when you need to quickly decide which rules to load.

## First 4 Steps

1. Read `agent-behavior.mdc` for core constraints and conflict protocol.
2. Read `project-context.mdc` to identify active stack routers.
3. Open the relevant router from `rule-index.mdc`.
4. Load only 2–3 rules needed for the current sub-task.

## If `project-context.mdc` Is Placeholder-Only

Request `development/project-onboarding.mdc`, generate `project-context.mdc`, then continue with router-driven loading.

## Common Task Shortcuts

- Build API endpoint: `languages/*/controllers.mdc`, `languages/*/validation.mdc`, `languages/*/error-handling.mdc`
- Add tests: `languages/*/testing.mdc`, `patterns/testing.mdc`, `development/tdd-workflow.mdc`
- Security hardening: `languages/*/security.mdc`, `languages/*/input-sanitization.mdc`, `languages/*/auth.mdc`
- Refactor/cleanup: `patterns/clean-code.mdc`, stack `languages/*/code-quality.mdc`
- Infra changes (Lambda): `languages/aws-lambda/cdk-infrastructure-*.mdc`, `languages/aws-lambda/monitoring.mdc`, `languages/aws-lambda/security.mdc`

**See also:** `rule-index.mdc`, `README.md`, `development/project-onboarding.mdc`
