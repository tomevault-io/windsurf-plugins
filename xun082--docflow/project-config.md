description: Validation workflow and allowed scripts (pnpm only)

Use pnpm for all scripts. The project is always running; do not use `pnpm dev`.

Before considering work complete, ensure all pass:

1. `pnpm type-check`
2. `pnpm lint`
3. `pnpm format`

If script names differ in package.json, update them accordingly so these commands exist and succeed.
