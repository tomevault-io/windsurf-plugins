description: Global components and utilities conventions
---


When working in `components/**` and `utils/**`:

- Components under `components/**` are reusable across the app; keep them pure and well-typed.
- `utils/**` contains side-effect-free helpers, constants, and data transforms.
- Naming: PascalCase for components/types/enums; camelCase for variables/functions/hooks; kebab-case for file names.
- Avoid framework-specific assumptions in `utils/`.
- Provide examples and minimal docs in code comments where helpful (self-explanatory first).
