# Leemo engineering guide

Leemo is a general desktop AI agent with two product surfaces: the `momo`
companion and the local workbench. Learning and job-search experiences build on
the same execution, workspace, memory, and permission layers; they must not fork
into a weaker second agent.

## Product invariants

- Use user-facing language. Do not expose Claude Code implementation names,
  model aliases, environment variables, or internal protocol terms in normal UI.
- A notebook is a real local folder. Its conversations, files, and governed
  memory move with it. Global momo remains outside any single notebook.
- momo may have an opinion, but must not reinterpret or refuse an ordinary user
  task. Genuine safety, permission, capability, and technical limits stay clear.
- Settings and runtime behavior must share one semantic source. New tools join a
  capability class instead of accumulating one-off permission exceptions.
- Credentials stay in the main process and must never cross IPC or enter logs.
- A feature is complete only after its visible user path, failure state, and
  restart recovery are verified in proportion to risk.

## Product-quality discipline

- Do not optimize only for the latest explicit edit. Before changing a surface,
  identify the user outcome, its parent layout, adjacent states, and durable
  product constraints. Explicit and locally testable goals must not hide data
  risk, long-term side effects, broken recovery, or a worse overall experience.
- A local UI fix is not complete until the parent surface is visually reviewed
  at representative widths. After removing, hiding, or moving an element,
  rebalance the released space and recheck alignment, hierarchy, density,
  responsive behavior, and the core click path. Passing the component test alone
  is insufficient evidence.
- User-visible UI, screenshots, PDFs, presentations, reports, and exports contain
  only real product or business content. Do not put agent reasoning, design
  rationale, debugging notes, implementation plans, or phrases such as “我将”、
  “我们可以”、“本页面用于展示”、“这里会” into deliverables unless the user
  explicitly asks for a design/process record. Keep that material in chat,
  code comments, plans, or review documents instead.
- All mutable visual color roles belong in `src/renderer/design/tokens.css`.
  Components consume semantic `--leemo-*` roles; theme changes select a
  validated `data-theme` palette and never fork page-specific color CSS. A
  color change is not accepted until the whole parent surface is rechecked and
  the newest screenshot is retained under `.tmp-visual-audit`.

## Development

Requirements: Windows, Node.js 20 or newer, and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run electron:dev
```

Before a pull request:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run verify:bundled-skills
npm run build
npm run build:main
```

Use focused tests while iterating. Keep edits scoped, prefer existing typed IPC
and store patterns, and do not create tiny modules unless they remove real
complexity. Never commit `.env`, personal paths, generated screenshots, unpacked
applications, model credentials, or private skill bundles.

## Packaging

`npm run electron:pack` builds the public base edition. An optional advanced
Office bundle can be supplied locally under `bundled-skills/office/release`, but
that directory is ignored and is not part of the open-source repository. See
[`bundled-skills/office/README.md`](./bundled-skills/office/README.md).
