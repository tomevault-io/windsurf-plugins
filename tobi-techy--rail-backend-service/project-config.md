# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a Go backend service. Entry points live in `cmd/`, with `cmd/main.go` as the main server. Core code is under `internal/`: `internal/api` for handlers, middleware, and routes; `internal/domain` for entities and services; `internal/infrastructure` for database, config, and external adapters; and `internal/workers` for background jobs. Shared packages belong in `pkg/`. Migrations live in `migrations/`, config in `configs/`, scripts in `scripts/`, and deployment assets in `deployments/` and `infra/`. Tests live in package-local `*_test.go` files and in `test/` (`test/unit`, `test/integration`, `test/performance`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `make build` — build `bin/rail_service`.
- `make run` — start the API locally from `cmd/main.go`.
- `make dev` — boot local dependencies with Docker, run migrations, then start the app.
- `make test` — run the full Go test suite with race detection and coverage.
- `make test-coverage` — generate `coverage.out` and `coverage.html`.
- `make lint` — run `golangci-lint`.
- `make security-scan` — run `gosec` and `trivy`.
- `make migrate-up` — apply database migrations.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Target Go `1.24`. Format all Go code with `gofmt`; do not manually tune spacing. Keep package names lowercase, exported identifiers in `CamelCase`, unexported identifiers in `camelCase`, and test files named `*_test.go`. Follow the existing layers: domain logic stays out of handlers, and infrastructure concerns stay out of `internal/domain`. Run `golangci-lint run ./...` before opening a PR.

## Testing Guidelines

Use Go’s `testing` package with `testify` where helpful. Prefer table-driven tests and cover success and failure paths. Run targeted tests during development, for example `go test ./internal/...` or `go test ./test/integration/... -v`. Integration tests expect PostgreSQL and Redis; CI uses Postgres 15 and Redis 7. Keep coverage on changed code meaningful, and update `test/README.md` when you add notable scenarios.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history follows imperative subjects with prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `infra:`, `security:`, `perf:`, and `chore:`. Keep commits focused and avoid vague messages like `commit`. PRs should include: a concise summary, linked issue or task, test evidence (`make test` or targeted package tests), and notes for migrations, config changes, or new environment variables. For API changes, include example request/response payloads.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit live secrets or edited `.env` files. Start from `.env.example` and config under `configs/`. Prefer secret managers and environment variables for credentials. If you touch auth, payments, or webhooks, run `make security-scan` before review.

## What we have learned

- Outcome tracking & calibration: `OutcomeTracker` (outcome_tracker.go) records every prediction as a pending outcome, evaluates whether it materialised after the horizon expires, and stores the result in `miriam_prediction_outcomes`. `GetPredictionHitRate` returns accuracy ratio over a lookback period. In `RefreshMoneyState`, the confidence score is multiplied by the hit rate (if > 0) so past prediction accuracy directly scales confidence — a system that's been 60% right can't claim "high confidence". Migration file: `219_miriam_prediction_outcomes`.
- Confidence score is now data-density-aware: tiers based on `activeMonths` for income (0–35) and spending (0–25) signals instead of flat rule-based points. Anomaly detection compares against 6-month trailing average instead of single prior month.
- RampHub UseBread sell (offramp) deposit address is NOT at `providerDetails.depositAddress` or `ourCryptoAddress`. It's nested at `providerDetails.data.deposit.address` (snake_case). Similarly, the send amount is at `providerDetails.data.deposit.amount`. The `ProviderDeposit` struct now has `Address`, `Asset`, `Note` fields for sell-side; `OrderResponse` has `CryptoDepositAddress()` and `CryptoDepositAmount()` helpers to normalize across providers. The sell order normalization in `service.go` calls these before persisting and transferring.
- iMessage bridge uses real `spectrum-ts` SDK (v8.2.1), not the fake `@spectrumlabs/photon` package. Pattern: `Spectrum({projectId, projectSecret, providers:[imessage.config()]})` + `for await (const [space, message] of app.messages)` + `space.send(builder)`. No `.spaces.get()`, no `.on("app.messages")` — real SDK is async-iterator based.
- Account linking is sender-verified: POST `/api/v1/platform/link` issues a one-time token; binding happens when the user texts the token back from iMessage (captures the real platform sender). No insecure `POST /link/confirm` endpoint.
