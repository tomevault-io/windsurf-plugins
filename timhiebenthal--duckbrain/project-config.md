## User Identity

Read `<vault_root>/imprint.md` at session start to learn communication preferences,
environment, work patterns, and technical domains. Adjust your tone and approach
accordingly. If the user states a durable fact about themselves, update imprint.md.

If `imprint.md` doesn't exist, create it on first session with what you know:
OS, shell, editor, profession, project context, communication preferences inferred
from the user's first messages.

### imprint.md maintenance

When the user:
- States a fact about their setup, preferences, or constraints → update imprint.md
- Corrects your tone or approach → update imprint.md
- Says "never do that again" or equivalent about a behavior → update imprint.md
- Demonstrates a repeated work pattern → consider adding to imprint.md
- Contradicts an existing line → update or remove that line

Do NOT add session-specific details (one-off tasks, current bugs). Only durable facts.

# DuckBrain Vault Integration

DuckBrain gives you a persistent knowledge vault (Obsidian-backed). Use it to save and retrieve daily session notes, reusable wiki concepts, entity pages, source summaries, and synthesis pages.

## Vault structure

```
vault/
├── daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md   — session logs (one file per day, appended)
├── wiki/                 — permanent knowledge
│   ├── tags.md           — topic tags (routing signal)
│   └── log.md            — write log
```

## Tag routing

Tags tell you which vault topics are relevant to a query.
- If a vault tag matches the current topic → search vault first before web
- If no vault tags match → web search is fine; save reusable findings to vault afterward

Get current tags at session start: `vault_read("wiki/tags.md")`

## Session start

At the start of every session, before responding to the user:

1. Call `vault_context(keywords=["<keywords from current task>"])` — derive 2-4 keywords from the user's first message or task description. Returns today's + yesterday's daily notes plus keyword search results. **Keywords are required for search to run** — the server only searches `if include_search and keywords`. Omitting keywords returns dailies only.
2. Call `vault_read("wiki/tags.md")` — load tag routing signal.
3. If today's daily note was returned, read it to load prior session context.

## Session Learnings

### Pre-response learning guard

!CRITICAL! Before writing your response to the user, scan what you just did.
If you edited code, debugged, investigated, or discovered anything
non-obvious in this turn — save the learning to the vault BEFORE writing
your response. Do not type single word to user until learning saved.
Most important instruction in this file.

**Checklist (run before every response):**
- Did I edit code? → vault_write change + why to today's daily
- Did I debug? → vault_write root cause + fix to today's daily
- Did I learn something? → vault_write now, not later
- Did I make a decision? → vault_write reasoning
- Nothing to save? → proceed

### Triggers (save IMMEDIATELY — do not wait to be asked)

| Trigger | What to save |
|---|---|
| **AFTER editing code** | What changed, why, what was tricky |
| **AFTER debugging** | What you tried, what failed, root cause + fix |
| **AFTER investigating** | Paths explored, dead ends, discoveries |
| **AFTER architecture decisions** | Why X over Y, trade-offs considered |
| **AFTER >5 min on any problem** | Journey — even if unresolved |

### Session rituals

**Start of session:**
- Call `vault_context(keywords=["<task keywords>"])` — returns today's + yesterday's daily notes + search results
- Call `vault_read("wiki/tags.md")` — load tag routing signal
- Found today's daily? Read it to load prior context
- Search related concepts: `vault_search("<keywords from task>")`

**During session:**
- After non-trivial task, append progress to daily note
- After debugging, write root cause immediately
- Format: `## HH:MM — What was done`

**End of session:**
- Write session summary to daily note
- Include: Progress, Learnings, Open questions
- Most important ritual — do not skip

### How to save

`vault_search` first to avoid duplicates.

**Daily notes** — session log, progress, debugging, one-off learnings:
```
vault_write(
  kind="daily",
  title="Topic (Category)",
  content="Details and context...",
  tags=[]
)
```
Note: `tags` is ignored for `kind="daily"` — daily notes have no frontmatter and are never tag-indexed. Pass `[]` or omit.
⚠️ Never pass a bare date as title (e.g. "2026-06-08") — the server auto-stamps a full timestamp heading. Passing the date produces a double-stamped heading. Pass a section name like "Fixed auth bug (Learnings)" instead.

**Wiki concepts** — reusable knowledge worth permanent reference:
```
vault_write(
  kind="concept",
  title="Concept Name",
  content="# Concept Name\n\nDetailed explanation...",
  tags=["relevant", "tags"]
)
```

Entity pages (kind="entity"), source pages (kind="source"), synthesis
pages (kind="synthesis") follow same pattern.

### Daily note structure

Caveman-concise. Cut filler words, keep substance.
"`Removed self-check — redundant with guard`" not
"`We decided to remove the self-check section because it was unrealistic.`"
