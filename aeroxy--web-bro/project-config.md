# Web Bro Agent Configuration

## Overview of this project

Web Bro is a browser-only workspace agent built with transformer.js that runs Gemma 4 E2B-it ONNX fully in the browser on WebGPU. It allows users to pick a local folder as a workspace using the File System Access API and provides a shallow tool loop for directory listing, text search, file reading, and writing. The agent writes directly into the selected workspace, snapshots previous contents in IndexedDB for undo functionality, and persists chat threads, workspace sessions, settings, and write backups locally.

Key features include:
- Runs Gemma 4 E2B-it ONNX entirely in-browser via WebGPU
- File System Access API for local folder workspace selection
- Shallow tool loop with list_dir, search_text, read_file, write_file operations
- Direct writing to workspace with snapshot-based undo functionality
- Local persistence of chat threads, sessions, settings, and backups
