## Project Overview

**grep-dap** is a package for inferring the contents of an OPeNDAP server.

## Primary context

I’m interested in the potential use of GenAI to help address the loose metadata constraints associated with OPeNDAP. Some background: The OPeNDAP DAP (data access protocol) was designed with a rigid syntactic metadata structure and a virtually free semantic metadata structure. The syntactic metadata defines the structure of the data. One way to think about this is that it is the metadata that is needed figure out how to plot the data. The semantic metadata tells you about the meaning and provenance of the data, what you would, for example, need to label plots of the data. OPeNDAP is a client-server protocol. 

The idea is that a user makes a request, from their application, for a subset of a dataset on a remote verser. The form of the request is rigidly defined by the DAP. On the server side there is a translator, which maps the data from the structure in which it is stored to the structure of the DAP. The server also extracts the specified subset of the data from the archive. The extracted and reformatted data are compressed and sent to the client side. On the client side they are decompressed and converter to the data model of the client. The user can request what metadata there is as well. The reason for the loose constraints on the metadata is that when we built the system we were concerned that if a rigid structure for the metadata was specified many potential providers would simply not serve their data.

The result is that there are many OPeNDAP servers but, not surprisingly, the metadata associated with these data sets varies from nonexistent to very complete; i.e., a weakness and a strength of OPeNDAP is the lack of constraints on the metadata. Even for a dataset with no semantic metadata there is often information associated with the data that might help in sorting out of the semantic information. For example, there is information in the names of files and folders, the syntactic metadata of the data says something about its content—an 8 dimensional array is not likely to be a collection of photographs of paintings—and there is information in the structure, the relationship between data elements in, for example, a 2d array.

I have been involved in work in which we have used contrastive learning to characterize SST fields. Given another archive of 2d fields, I could apply the model we developed to the new data to see what the probability is that it is SST data. You get the idea.  One of the beauties of OPeNDAP is that I can easily sample data from archives if I know the server address. Given that some archives are very well defined I can compare, in a statistical sense, samples from these with samples from the new archive…

# Potential solution

The following describes a potential solution to the problem.  We will refine the approach as we develop.

## Background

OPeNDAP (DAP) is a client-server protocol for remote access to scientific datasets. It has:

A well-defined syntactic metadata structure, which describes how the data are organized (variables, dimensions, arrays, etc.). This is sufficient for accessing and plotting the data.

A loosely constrained semantic metadata structure, which describes meaning, provenance, and context. This varies widely across datasets—from very complete to nearly nonexistent.

This design reflects a tradeoff: lower barriers to serving data, but weaker guarantees about semantic clarity.

A key feature of OPeNDAP is that a client can request small subsets of both data and metadata from remote archives.


## Problem Context

Suppose I encounter a new OPeNDAP-accessible dataset with little or unreliable semantic metadata.

Even in such cases, there are often indirect clues about the data, including:


Variable names, file names, and directory structure
Syntactic metadata (dimensions, shapes, coordinate variables)
Units and attributes (when present)
Relationships among variables
Small samples of the data itself (via remote subsetting)
Statistical or structural properties of the data
Similarities to other, better-understood datasets


For example, the structure and behavior of a field may suggest what kind of geophysical quantity it represents, even if it is not explicitly labeled.


## Prompt

Given this setting, what are plausible ways that GenAI could be used to help interpret, characterize, or make sense of such a dataset?

You can think broadly about what “characterize” might mean in this context.

I am interested in ideas, approaches, or conceptual frameworks—these do not need to be fully specified systems.



## Considerations


Any approach should be consistent with the basic capabilities of OPeNDAP (remote access, subsetting, variable inspection)
The available information may be incomplete, inconsistent, or partially misleading
The goal is not necessarily to produce a single definitive answer, but to improve understanding of the dataset
