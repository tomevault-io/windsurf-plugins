# Claude notes

Non-obvious rules for this codebase. Add entries only where the WHY isn't
visible in the code.

## Renderer: scale and stitching

- One worker pool per `(styleID, scale)` tuple. Scale is baked into the
  maplibre-native `ratio` at pool construction — not a per-request parameter.
  Pools are created lazily by `getOrCreatePool(styleID, scale)`.
- **Two-level concurrency:** `cfg.PoolSize` (RENDERER_POOL_SIZE) is a
  **global** semaphore capping concurrent renders across *all* pools, not a
  per-pool size. `cfg.StylePoolSize` (STYLE_POOL_SIZE, default=PoolSize) is
  the per-pool worker count. Without the global cap, N styles × M scales ×
  PoolSize workers could oversubscribe CPU; the semaphore keeps the ceiling
  at PoolSize regardless of how many pools exist.
- For local styles: default is native viewport render for all zooms
  (`LOCAL_STYLES_USE_VIEWPORT=true` by default). Set to `false` to route
  integer-zoom requests through tile stitching; fractional zoom is
  always viewport-rendered regardless. The dispatcher
  (`generateBaseStaticMap`) picks the branch on
  `isFractional(zoom) || h.localUseViewport`.
- External styles can't use viewport render — they always tile-stitch,
  with fractional zoom approximated to the nearest integer.
  `logExternalViewportApprox` logs this so it's observable.
- Worker receives **logical** `width × height` and outputs
  `width*scale × height*scale` actual pixels. `encodeRGBA` must be called
  with the pixel dimensions or the output has the wrong extent.
- **Viewport zoom convention differs from MapLibre.** Callers send zoom
  in the 256-tile web-map convention (what poracle, Google, OSM, etc.
  use). MapLibre Native interprets zoom in the style source's tileSize
  convention — 512 for vector sources (the default). We subtract
  `log2(tileSize/256)` from the user's zoom before dispatching, so a
  512-tileSize style sees `zoom-1` internally. See `styleZoomOffset`.
  The adjustment is only applied on the viewport path; `TileToViewport`
  already produces a 512-pixel frame that matches MapLibre's native
  units for the common 512-tileSize case, so tile rendering is already
  correct.
- Regression hotspot. `77e68a8` reverted a scale>1 viewport bypass;
  `3f345cd` added per-scale pools. Exercise scale=1 **and** scale=2
  whenever you touch viewport/tile math.

## Cache intent: nocache, TTL, owned

- `nocache=true` bypasses the composite LRU **read** (forces a fresh
  render) but still writes the result back and still dedupes concurrent
  siblings via singleflight. It does not touch the tile or marker
  caches — those have their own freshness rules.
- `nocache=true` + `pregenerate=true` with no explicit `ttl` defaults
  `ttl=30` so the returned URL lives long enough for the consumer to
  fetch the file. `nocache` itself doesn't affect the disk lifetime.
- The expiry queue is **extend-only**: a shorter TTL never shortens an
  existing entry. This is the only reason concurrent TTL / owned
  requests don't delete each other's files.
- `OwnedThreshold` requires a `CacheCleaner` for the target folder. With
  no cleaner, `Unown` is never called and the owned set grows for the
  process lifetime.

## Base vs final path (image-first, in-memory)

- The hot path's primary currency is `image.Image`, not bytes.
  `ensureBase` returns `image.Image`; `generateStaticMap` and the
  public `GenerateStaticMap` return `image.Image`; the multi
  composer consumes `[]image.Image` from component calls. Encoding
  happens once per HTTP response at the boundary via
  `http.ServeContent(…, bytes.NewReader(encoded))`. No disk
  round-trip on the critical path for local-style requests.
- `CompositeImageCache` (`services.GlobalCompositeImageCache`) is
  the cross-request burst-sharing mechanism. Keyed by path. Holds
  base renders and final staticmap outputs as `image.Image`. Size
  via `COMPOSITE_IMAGE_CACHE_SIZE` (default 200).
- Shared bases (N users, same viewport, different drawables) and
  shared components (multi requests reusing panel viewports) both
  hit this cache without triggering any PNG round-trip. The
  encode-on-serve cost is the only encode in the non-pregenerate
  hot path.
- `baseSfg` dedupes concurrent base renders; the outer `sfg`
  dedupes final-path generation. Followers share the leader's
  image pointer via the sfg return value.
- `staticMap.BasePath()` is the LRU key for base images;
  `staticMap.Path()` for final staticmaps. Both stable across
  process lifetime.
- **Disk writes happen only for `?pregenerate=true`.** Neither
  local-viewport nor external-style tile stitching persists the
  stitched base anymore — both produce an `image.Image` that goes
  into the LRU. Individual tile files (`Cache/Tile/*.png`) are
  still disk-backed for cross-restart tile-download reuse; it's
  the stitched basePath that's gone.
- **Enqueue invariant:** `services.GlobalExpiryQueue.Add` (via
  `enqueueWithBase`) is only called from
  `handlePregenerateResponseBytes`, right next to the
  `AtomicWriteFile`. Every disk file has exactly one matching
  expiry registration. Handler code above does not call
  `enqueueWithBase` — adding one for a file that was never written
  was a latent footgun in the pre-bytes-first pipeline.
