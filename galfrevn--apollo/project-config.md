# Code Quality

## Full type safety, no escape hatches

Every value must have a precise type. Forbidden: `any`, `as any`, `as unknown as X`, `// @ts-ignore`, `// @ts-expect-error`, non-null assertions (`!`) on untrusted data, implicit `any` parameters. Validate every external input with `zod`.

```ts
// ❌ BAD
function handle(payload: any) {
  return payload.user.id as string;
}

// ✅ GOOD
const incomingPayloadSchema = z.object({ user: z.object({ id: z.string() }) });
function handleIncomingPayload(rawPayload: unknown): string {
  return incomingPayloadSchema.parse(rawPayload).user.id;
}
```

Prefer `unknown` over `any` for boundaries. Use `readonly` on properties and arrays that should not mutate. Use discriminated unions instead of optional booleans.

## No comments unless strictly necessary

The code itself documents what it does through descriptive names. Only write a comment when it explains a non-obvious *why* — a workaround, a trade-off, a constraint, an external spec — that the reader cannot infer from the code.

```ts
// ❌ BAD — narrating the obvious
// Increment the counter
attemptCount += 1;

// ✅ GOOD — explains intent the code cannot
// Postgres rejects identifiers longer than 63 bytes; truncate before sending.
const truncatedSchemaName = rawSchemaName.slice(0, 63);
```

Never use comments to communicate with the user, log progress, or annotate diffs.

## Modular, single-responsibility files

Keep one cohesive concern per file. Group by layer (`commands/`, `services/`, `runners/`, `configuration/`, `core/`, `presentation/`). Files should not exceed ~300 lines; split when they do. Never reach across layers — commands call services, services call runners, runners talk to the OS. Catalogs (configuration) hold pure data only.

Pure functions over classes when possible. Inject context as the last argument (`CommandExecutionContext`) instead of reading globals. Keep public exports explicit; do not re-export everything.
