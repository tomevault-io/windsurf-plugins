# Gemini Project Instructions for pickit

This document provides high-level instructions for AI assistants working on the `pickit` project.

## Development Mandate

All development on this project **must** adhere strictly to the design documents and plans located in the `prompt/` directory. These documents are the single source of truth for project requirements, architecture, and implementation strategy.

- **Requirements Specification:** `prompt/requirements.md`
- **Implementation Rules:** `prompt/implementation-rule.md`
- **Development Plan:** `prompt/plan.md`
- **Bug Fixes Plan:** `prompt/tasks.md`

Before making any code changes, review these documents to ensure your work aligns with the established plan. The implementation should follow the incremental Pull Request (PR) ~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill <skill-name>
Tool Mapping for Codex: When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:

structure defined in `prompt/plan.md`.

## Workflow

1. **Review Requirements:** Start by reviewing the `prompt/requirements.md` document to understand the project's objectives and constraints.
2. **Plan Implementation:** Use the `prompt/plan.md` document to outline your approach and plan your development steps.
3. **Follow Implementation Rules:** Ensure your code adheres to the guidelines outlined in `prompt/implementation-rule.md`.
4. **Incremental PRs:** Implement features incrementally using Pull Requests (PRs) to maintain a clean and manageable codebase.
5. **Tool Substitution:** If necessary, substitute tools referenced in skills with equivalent tools you have access to.
