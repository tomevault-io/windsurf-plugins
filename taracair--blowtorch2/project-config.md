# README voice (do not rewrite)

`README.md` is the maintainer’s own public intro. **Do not rewrite, soften, or “professionalize” it.**

## Locked voice (must stay)

- Opening: first public repo / first bigger GitHub work (“Hello folks and beware! …”)
- Honest LLM line: uses LLM for code/docs; still tests and decides what ships
- Casual first-person tone presenting the fork

## Allowed edits only

- Fact updates the user asked for (new commands, paths, build steps, package ids, links)
- Fix broken links or clearly wrong technical facts
- Never change the intro paragraphs or LLM disclosure unless the user explicitly rewrites them

If docs need a more formal tone, put that in `docs/FDROID_README.md` / store metadata — **not** by replacing root `README.md`.
