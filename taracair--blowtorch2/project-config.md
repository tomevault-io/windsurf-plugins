# No private worlds in the product

The GitHub tree is public. The APK is public. Do not put the maintainer's worlds,
guilds, characters, hosts, or other private life into anything that ships or is
tracked.

Public contact is **`taracair@gmail.com`** (and the GitHub name Taracair). It
may appear in UI, Help, README, comments, and tests. It is not a secret.

## Do not

- Name a live MUD, guild, or player in UI, Help, Starter Tutorial, default
  settings, Lua, or comments/tests that git tracks
- Use a real profile filename or host as a worked example
- Write “the profile he plays” or similar

```java
// BAD — names the world they actually play
// measured on world-a.xml (the profile he plays)
assertEquals("world-a", world);

// GOOD
// measured on a live world (11 of 105 chunks)
assertEquals("world-a", world);
```

## Do

- Tests and comments: `world-a`, `example.org`, `a live world`, `an older profile`
- Protocol **ids** stay as the wire sends them (`dns-org-hellmoo-status`).
  Player-visible **labels** stay generic (`Vitals bar (hp, thirst, hunger, stress)`).
- Put `taracair@gmail.com` where a contact address belongs. Git *author* is
  still GitHub noreply (`git-noreply-author.mdc`) because GitHub rejects the
  inbox on push (GH007) — that is not a privacy ban.
