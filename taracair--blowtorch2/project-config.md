description: How a release is cut and named. Read when the maintainer asks for one.

# Releasing

Daily work is `staging` and is covered by `orchestration.mdc` and
`docs/GUARDRAILS.md`. This file is only the part no script does: what a release
is called and where it goes.

Committing `staging` is routine and needs no permission. Pushing it is not:
do **not** `git push` unless the maintainer asked for that push. `main` is
not routine either: **work stays on `staging` until the maintainer says a
release is being cut** (their words, 8 August: "staging jest do momentu
release, wtedy proszę o main → release, a potem wracamy na staging"). A
confirmed test APK means the work is good, not that it ships — do not offer
the merge after every confirmation. Once a release is asked for, the
`staging` → `main` merge is yours to do.

Tags, GitHub releases and production APKs need asking every time.

## Steps

1. Show the release notes first and wait for an OK.
2. Bump `versionCode` / `versionName`.
3. `BT_LOCAL_SIGN=1 ./gradlew :BT_Free:assembleProductionRelease`
4. Tag `vX.Y.Z`, then `gh release create` on **Taracair/BlowTorch2**. Always pass
   `-R Taracair/BlowTorch2`; the default `gh` remote may be upstream.
5. After the release, sync `staging` with `main` (`ff-only` both ways as needed).

## Asset name and body

Match the **v2.1.10** scheme, not the raw Gradle output name. Copy
`BT_Free/build/outputs/apk/production/release/BT_Free-production-release.apk` to
`BlowTorch2-vX.Y.Z-production-release.apk` before uploading.

Body: `## New Features`, `## Fixed`, optional `## Others`. It must end with

```markdown
## Notes
- versionCode **NNN** / versionName **X.Y.Z**
```

Nothing else in Notes. No F-Droid URL, Discord, or Ko-fi — those are already on the README badges.

Player-facing notes accumulate in `docs/changelog_draft.md` (gitignored). Copy
that into the release body when shipping.

## How to write the notes

Baseline is the **last shipped tag** (`origin/main`). Run
`git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`. That is the changelog. Do not diff
against an older tag once a newer one exists.

Player-facing vs that tag only:

- Do not re-list what the previous GitHub or Fastlane changelog already said.
- No staging names (`was .lupa`). No “we tried X then fixed it”.
- Did not exist for the player at the last tag → **New Features**. Broken then,
  works now → **Fixed**.
- One bullet per theme. Five suggestion switches are **Better suggestion
  engine**, not five bullets. Example: you type `helmte` and get `helmet`.
- Skip internal completer bookkeeping unless asked.
- Fastlane `changelogs/NNN.txt` is three or four short store lines, same delta,
  not a copy of the GitHub essay.

Clear `changelog_draft.md` after the tag ships so the next draft cannot
accumulate the last release.

## Local APK copies

The parent folder keeps exactly two fixed-name builds, refreshed after each
build and never accumulated:

- `../BlowTorch2-btTest-debug.apk`
- `../BlowTorch2-production-release.apk`

`scripts/deploy.sh` refreshes the first one itself.
