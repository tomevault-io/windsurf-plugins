# BlowTorch working agreement

Work on branch `staging`. The maintainer decides what ships. Full version in
`CLAUDE.md`; this file exists because Cursor needs the short list unconditionally
present, not fetched.

## Six rules

The rest of what used to be here is enforced by scripts now. `docs/GUARDRAILS.md`
lists what is blocked and where. If a guard blocks you, it is telling you a fact
about this project, not being difficult.

1. **Measure before you touch.** Reading this code has produced a confident,
   wrong hypothesis at least six times. The device is the authority.
2. **Say what you did not verify.** Every time. Never say "works" when you mean
   "compiles" or "installed".
3. **Do not guess mechanisms.** A measurement is a fact; the explanation for it
   is a guess until checked, and a plausible wrong explanation in a durable
   place is worse than none.
4. **Fix the cause, not the symptom.** Remove the throw rather than quieten the
   log. A wider `catch` moves the symptom away from the cause.
5. **"Behaviour-preserving" needs an argument, not an assertion.** Show why the
   output is identical, or extract, test against old behaviour, then delegate.
6. **The second attempt is the signal.** Fixing the same failure in the same
   place twice means the first fix was a guess. Stop at the third: read what the
   API actually requires, then write one informed fix. If that still fails, go
   back to the maintainer before a seventh approach. Ask two things out loud:
   do they want what they said, and is what they said what you understood.

## Code comments

Default: no comment. If one is useful, 1–2 lines. Keep measurements, API quirks,
compatibility constraints, and "not measured". Do not guess a mechanism (rule 3),
narrate the implementation, or write what the previous version did. When editing,
condense only comments on the code you are already changing. No repo-wide sweep
unless asked. Method: `docs/ORCHESTRATION.md` ("Comments are facts, not essays").

## Commands

```sh
scripts/check.sh          # everything checkable without a device; what CI runs
scripts/deploy.sh         # test, build btTest debug, resolve serial, install -r
scripts/adb-device.sh     # print a usable serial, nothing else
```

Run `scripts/deploy.sh` before reporting a code step done, once per step, after
its last commit. Report "installed", not "works". Do not resolve the adb serial
by hand and never ask the maintainer for the wifi port; `scripts/adb-device.sh`
finds it.

## Before you touch these five areas, read docs/CODEBASE-TRAPS.md

UI to `:stellar` binder, `static` state, settings serialisation, thread
ownership, the Lua to Java boundary. Those are where reading the code
confidently teaches you something false. Elsewhere, do not load it.

## Commits

At the end of each turn that produced a complete change, commit on `staging`.
Do **not** `git push` unless the maintainer asked for that push. Laptop copies
are the maintainer's NAS backup, not GitHub. Message is one or two sentences
on why, not a file list.

Before a requested push: read `git log origin/staging..HEAD` (or `main..HEAD`
if unpushed), and only push if those commits are ones they would want on
GitHub — squash probe/revert noise and obvious split-steps first. Do not spam
the remote with a commit per try.

Say how many **unpushed** commits are on `staging` in the status to the
maintainer (not every sentence; once per turn that committed, and whenever
they ask what is waiting). `git rev-list --count origin/staging..HEAD`.

One commit is one rollback point. Two unrelated fixes in one turn are two
commits. Probes get their own commit. Do not commit a half-written file or
an empty tree. This repo's rule wins over any editor default that says wait.

`staging` is allowed to grow. `main` is the release branch and is only
touched when the maintainer asks for a release. A confirmed test APK means
the work is good, not that it ships — do not offer the merge after every
confirmation. When a release is asked for, the `staging` → `main` merge is
the agent's job.

What still needs asking every time: tags, GitHub releases, production APKs. See
`.cursor/rules/release-workflow.mdc`.

A commit message is a claim. "Nothing reads this", "equivalent to the old path",
"X already does this" are assertions about code somewhere else. Go and look
before writing them down, and say how you know.

## Explain in examples

"You type `kk goblin` and the game receives `kill $1`" beats "unanchored aliases
do not substitute captures".

Write to the maintainer in **Polish** unless they switch language. Code,
comments, commit messages and `docs/` stay in English.

## F-Droid

The production APK is on F-Droid (or in the inclusion MR). Do not add a
`uses-permission`, a new foreground-service type, or change `applicationId`
/ the launcher component without asking the maintainer first. A settings
checkbox that uses an already-declared permission (`WAKE_LOCK`) is fine.
Fastlane store text can change on the next tag; that is not a new permission.
