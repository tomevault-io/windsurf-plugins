# Review

Local checks first, always: `scripts/check.sh` (or `--tests` for the area
touched). Fix failures before anything else. Most findings a reviewer would
report are already in there and cost no tokens.

## Default: one reviewer, after the change, before the commit

Launch **one** Task. Do not set `subagent_type` to `bugbot`. Cursor pins that
type to Composer 2.5 and **ignores** `model`, so passing Grok does not change
what the UI shows. A `preToolUse` hook rewrites leftover `bugbot` launches;
do not rely on the hook as the plan.

Use:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: `cursor-grok-4.6-xhigh` (required; never omit, never inherit, never
  `composer-2.5`, never any `-fast` slug)
- `description`: `Bugbot`
- `prompt`: `Full Repository Path`, `Diff: uncommitted changes`, the trap
  section for the area, and a short "what this is" (paths + a few sentences,
  not a wave essay). Tell it to run `scripts/review-diff.sh` in that repo.

Do **not** dump whole-tree `git diff`. Cursor Shell results omit the middle
of large stdout. `scripts/review-diff.sh` prints a short index and writes
hunks to `.scratch/review-diff/page-NN.txt`. Read every listed page. A
one-page bundle that fits is also printed inline. Do not Read a 4000-line
class hunting for the hunk.

Triage, fix real findings, re-run until clean or until you hit something to
report. Then commit.

Review **before** the commit. After `scripts/deploy.sh` the working tree is
leftovers, not what shipped. To re-review a committed step: 
`scripts/review-diff.sh HEAD`, never `Diff: uncommitted changes`.

One logical change per review and per commit. A colour-bleed fix and a
launcher pin are two reviews. A wave of unrelated fixes is what truncates
the diff and picks the wrong trap section.

Docs and `.cursor/rules` edits: no subagent, self-check only.

## Advisors before implementing: rarely

Two parallel advisors before writing code, only when **both** hold.
Same launch as the reviewer: `generalPurpose` + `cursor-grok-4.6-xhigh`,
never `bugbot`, never fast.

- the change touches the binder, `static` state, settings serialisation, thread
  ownership, or the Lua to Java boundary, **and**
- the code being changed has no test covering the behaviour you are about to
  alter (check `BTLib/src/test/` first, it is easy to miss)

If there is a test, the test is the advisor, and it is cheaper and more reliable
than an opinion. Extract, write a test that passes against the old behaviour,
then change it. That is the evidence rule 5 asks for.

"Touches 3+ files" is **not** a trigger on this codebase. Five classes are over
4000 lines, so almost any real change spans subsystems. Using file count as the
trigger made the expensive path the default path.

## Give the reviewer a checklist, not the manual

When a reviewer needs project context, point it at `docs/CODEBASE-TRAPS.md`, and
only at the section for the area in the diff. Do not tell it to read
`docs/ORCHESTRATION.md`; that is the method, not a checklist, and four subagents
each pulling the whole thing in is how a small change costs a large session.

## Reporting

End a code task with: which subagent ran, findings fixed vs deferred, the result
of `scripts/deploy.sh`, and what you did **not** verify. "Tests pass", "review
clean", "APK installed". Not "works". Whether it works is decided on the phone.
