# Project Instructions

<!-- deciduous:start -->
## Decision Graph Workflow

**THIS IS MANDATORY. Log decisions IN REAL-TIME, not retroactively.**

### Available Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/decision` | Manage decision graph - add nodes, link edges, sync |
| `/recover` | Recover context from decision graph on session start |
| `/work` | Start a work transaction - creates goal node before implementation |
| `/document` | Generate comprehensive documentation for a file or directory |
| `/build-test` | Build the project and run the test suite |
| `/serve-ui` | Start the decision graph web viewer |
| `/sync-graph` | Export decision graph to GitHub Pages |
| `/decision-graph` | Build a decision graph from commit history |
| `/sync` | Multi-user sync - pull events, rebuild, push |

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/pulse` | Map current design as decisions (Now mode) |
| `/narratives` | Understand how the system evolved (History mode) |
| `/archaeology` | Transform narratives into queryable graph |

### The Node Flow Rule - CRITICAL

The canonical flow through the decision graph is:

```
goal -> options -> decision -> actions -> outcomes
```

- **Goals** lead to **options** (possible approaches to explore)
- **Options** lead to a **decision** (choosing which option to pursue)
- **Decisions** lead to **actions** (implementing the chosen approach)
- **Actions** lead to **outcomes** (results of the implementation)
- **Observations** attach anywhere relevant
- Goals do NOT lead directly to decisions -- there must be options first
- Options do NOT come after decisions -- options come BEFORE decisions
- Decision nodes should only be created when an option is actually chosen, not prematurely

### The Core Rule

```
BEFORE you do something -> Log what you're ABOUT to do
AFTER it succeeds/fails -> Log the outcome
CONNECT immediately -> Link every node to its parent
AUDIT regularly -> Check for missing connections
```

### Behavioral Triggers - MUST LOG WHEN:

| Trigger | Log Type | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| User asks for a new feature | `goal` **with -p** | "Add dark mode" |
| Exploring possible approaches | `option` | "Use Redux for state" |
| Choosing between approaches | `decision` | "Choose state management" |
| About to write/edit code | `action` | "Implementing Redux store" |
| Something worked or failed | `outcome` | "Redux integration successful" |
| Notice something interesting | `observation` | "Existing code uses hooks" |

### Document Attachments

Attach files (images, PDFs, diagrams, specs, screenshots) to decision graph nodes for rich context.

```bash
# Attach a file to a node
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path>
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path> -d "Architecture diagram"
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path> --ai-describe

# List documents
deciduous doc list              # All documents
deciduous doc list <node_id>    # Documents for a specific node

# Manage documents
deciduous doc show <doc_id>     # Show document details
deciduous doc describe <doc_id> "Updated description"
deciduous doc describe <doc_id> --ai   # AI-generate description
deciduous doc open <doc_id>     # Open in default application
deciduous doc detach <doc_id>   # Soft-delete (recoverable)
deciduous doc gc                # Remove orphaned files from disk
```

**When to suggest document attachment:**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User shares an image or screenshot | Ask: "Want me to attach this to the current goal/action node?" |
| User references an external document | Ask: "Should I attach a copy to the decision graph?" |
| Architecture diagram is discussed | Suggest attaching it to the relevant goal node |
| Files not in the project are dropped in | Attach to the most relevant active node |

**Do NOT aggressively prompt for documents.** Only suggest when files are directly relevant to a decision node. Files are stored in `.deciduous/documents/` with content-hash naming for deduplication.

### CRITICAL: Capture VERBATIM User Prompts

**Prompts must be the EXACT user message, not a summary.** When a user request triggers new work, capture their full message word-for-word.

**BAD - summaries are useless for context recovery:**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS - this is a summary, not a prompt
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -p "User asked: add login to the app"
```

**GOOD - verbatim prompts enable full context recovery:**
```bash
# Use --prompt-stdin for multi-line prompts
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
I need to add user authentication to the app. Users should be able to sign up
with email/password, and we need OAuth support for Google and GitHub. The auth
should use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation.
EOF

# Or use the prompt command to update existing nodes
deciduous prompt 42 << 'EOF'
The full verbatim user message goes here...
EOF
```

**When to capture prompts:**
- Root `goal` nodes: YES - the FULL original request
- Major direction changes: YES - when user redirects the work
- Routine downstream nodes: NO - they inherit context via edges

**Updating prompts on existing nodes:**
```bash
deciduous prompt <node_id> "full verbatim prompt here"
cat prompt.txt | deciduous prompt <node_id>  # Multi-line from stdin
```
