# Documentation Guidelines

**Core Principle**: Update docs with code changes. Keep docs current with `main` branch.

## Quick Update Guide

### Design Changes → `docs/design/`
- New features → `design-doc.mdc`
- Database changes → `schema-design.mdc` + migration
- Architecture changes → `design-doc.mdc` + `implementation-plan.mdc`

### Testing Changes → `docs/testing/`
- New test tools → `testing-guide.md`
- New features → `features/<feature>-testing.md`

### Setup Changes → Root `docs/`
- Environment variables → `setup-instructions.md`
- File structure → `file-structure.mdc`
- Major features → `README.md`

## Database Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create migration
supabase migration new <description>

# 2. Write SQL in migration file

# 3. User runs SQL on Supabase Dashboard

# 4. Update schema doc
# Edit docs/design/schema-design.mdc

# 5. Commit together
git add supabase/migrations/ docs/design/schema-design.mdc
```

## Update Checklist
- [ ] Code changes have doc updates
- [ ] File paths are current
- [ ] New features have testing guides
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

**Remember**: Update docs as you code, not after.
