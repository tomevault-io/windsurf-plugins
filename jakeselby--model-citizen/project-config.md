# Model Citizen

A user-aligned, model-provider-agnostic harness with shared custom primitives and switchable
personal stances. `bin/harness` projects one policy authority into Claude Code and Codex. The global
rules an agent runs under in this repo come from the harness itself, so this file carries only
what is true of this repository.

## Commands

```sh
bin/harness lint                          # personal strings and secret patterns; must be clean
python3 -m unittest discover tests        # merge, link, config, lint logic
bin/harness sync --dry-run                # what a sync would do from this checkout
bin/harness doctor                        # versions, logins, links, drift
```

**Expected clean-tree output:** `lint: 0 finding(s) in …` and `OK` from unittest with no
skipped tests. Tests run under the system Python 3.9 and under a current Python; keep the
code free of syntax newer than 3.9.

## Gate

```sh
python3 bin/harness lint
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The `stop-gate` hook runs this block when the tree has changed since its last green run,
blocks the turn while it is red, and releases after eight consecutive blocks. It runs only
once this checkout is trusted: accept Claude Code's folder dialog or run `bin/harness trust .`.

## BMad planning

BMad Method 6.12.0 with BMM, Claude Code and Codex projections, and compatibility shims is the
repository's public planning system. Its authored corpus stays in `_bmad-output`; do not redirect
it to another repository. The complete pinned install command and version-control boundary are in
`docs/bmad.md`. Run planning workflows from the shared checkout and implementation from a managed
worktree.

Every SDLC step routes to its BMad skill, and every PR keeps the corpus current: the issue keeps a
summary, its story file carries the design. The routing map, the currency rule and the story-file
contract are in `docs/bmad-governance.md`, which every BMad workflow loads.

## How the checkout is used

- **This checkout is live.** `harness sync` symlinks `claude/rules`, each `claude/skills/*`,
  `claude/hooks` and the output style into `~/.claude`. An edit here is in effect in the next
  session with no further step; a half-finished rule is live too. Work in a worktree branched
  off `main`, so the live checkout only ever carries merged content.
- **Every change lands through a pull request.** The `main` ruleset requires green `lint` and
  `test` checks on an up-to-date branch and a squash merge; there is no direct push.
- **One delivery issue per PR, one PR per delivery issue.** Create or select a dedicated issue
  before changing files, including docs — file it with `scripts/bmad_issue_sync.py new`, or
  `reserve` an existing one, because `issue-ownership` also fails a PR whose issue has no BMad ID
  in `_bmad-output/issue-map.json`. Add `Closes #N` to the PR. Split separately delivered
  work into child issues; contextual references do not establish ownership. Reuse is allowed
  only when a previous PR was closed without merging. The `issue-ownership` check enforces
  current GitHub closing links; verify ownership again immediately before merging.
- **Code changes** (`bin/harness`, `claude/hooks/*.py`, `tests/`) carry a test with every
  change. Content changes (rules, stances, skill text, docs) are gated by the lint and review.
- Nothing personal, nothing project-specific, nothing copyleft. The lint enforces the first;
  review enforces the rest.

## CodeRabbit review and merging

CodeRabbit reviews pull requests into `main`, as `.coderabbit.yaml` configures it. On every pull
request, work through its review with `/build` step 6 and without asking first: push fixes to the
branch, reply in its threads and resolve them, and request each further pass with
`@coderabbitai review`, since a push never starts one. Request the first pass the same way when
automatic review skips the pull request, as it does drafts, `chore(release)` titles and Dependabot.
A pass has finished when the `CodeRabbit` commit status reads `success: Review completed`, seven to
eleven minutes after it starts, so allow fifteen. The `Review skipped` status it posts on every push
is not a pass, and neither is the empty review each of its thread replies creates. Comments in the
review body, outside the diff or marked as nitpicks, are findings too: fix them, or answer them in a
pull request comment.

**These conditions are the go-ahead `/land` asks for.** Merge a pull request from a branch of this
repository, never from a fork, without asking once all three hold:

1. **Nothing waits on the maintainer:** no question to them is open, no default you took on their
   behalf awaits their confirmation, and the diff does what the issue asks and no more.
2. **It is tested:** the Gate block passed before your last push, and every required check is green
   on the head commit.
3. **The review is worked through:** a pass completed after your last change to a file CodeRabbit
   reviews, each of its findings is fixed or answered with the reason, every thread is resolved,
   and no human's thread is open. Bringing in `main` needs no new pass.

Short of all three, report what remains with the pull request link and wait. A release, a tag and
