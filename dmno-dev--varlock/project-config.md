# Rule: Root Decorator Test Structure

## Description
Root decorator tests (such as for @disable, @defaultRequired, etc.) must follow a table-driven, DRY structure. Each test case should be represented as an object with fields for label, headers, values, and expected results. A single setup function should run all cases using describe().

## Rationale
- Ensures consistency and maintainability across all root decorator tests.
- Makes it easy to add new cases and reduces code duplication.
- Matches the style used in PR #47 and root-decorators.test.ts.

## Requirements
- Each root decorator test file must export a function that takes an array of test case objects and runs them using describe/it.
- Each test case object must include at least: label, headers, values, and expected results (e.g., expectedKeys, expectedDisabled, etc.).
- The test runner function must be used in describe() to run all cases.
- Avoid copy-pasting individual it() blocks for each case; use the table-driven approach.

## Example
```ts
function rootDecoratorTests(
  tests: Array<{
    label: string;
    headers: string;
    values: string;
    expectedKeys: string[];
    expectedDisabled: boolean;
  }>,
) {
  return () => {
    tests.forEach(({ label, headers, values, expectedKeys, expectedDisabled }) => {
      it(label, async () => {
        // ...setup and assertions...
      });
    });
  };
}

describe('@disable root decorator', rootDecoratorTests([
  // ...test cases...
]));
```

## Enforcement
- PRs adding or modifying root decorator tests must follow this structure.
- Reviewers should request changes if tests are not table-driven or DRY.
