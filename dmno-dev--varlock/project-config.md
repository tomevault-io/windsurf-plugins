# Rule: General Test Structure for env-graph

## Description
All tests in the env-graph package must follow best practices for maintainability, clarity, and extensibility. This includes using DRY setup, table-driven tests where appropriate, and clear assertion of expected behavior.

## Rationale
- Ensures tests are easy to read, extend, and maintain.
- Reduces code duplication and encourages consistent patterns across the codebase.
- Makes it easier to add new test cases and spot regressions.

## Requirements
- Use a single setup function or helper for repeated test logic (e.g., graph setup, data source creation).
- Prefer table-driven tests (array of test case objects) for scenarios with multiple similar cases.
- Each test case object should include a label/description and all relevant input/expected output fields.
- Use `describe()` and `it()` blocks to organize tests by feature or function.
- Assertions must clearly check the expected behavior (e.g., resolved values, errors, config keys, etc.).
- Avoid copy-pasting similar `it()` blocks; use iteration over test cases where possible.
- Use meaningful variable names and keep test logic concise.

## Example
```ts
function featureTests(
  tests: Array<{
    label: string;
    input: string;
    expected: any;
  }>,
) {
  return () => {
    tests.forEach(({ label, input, expected }) => {
      it(label, async () => {
        // ...setup and assertions...
      });
    });
  };
}

describe('some feature', featureTests([
  // ...test cases...
]));
```

## Enforcement
- All new and modified tests in env-graph must follow these guidelines.
- Reviewers should request changes if tests are not DRY, table-driven (where appropriate), or lack clear assertions.
