      When adding a new documentation page:

      - Follow all requirements in the [docs-location] rule for file placement, naming, and sidebar navigation.
      - Additionally, follow these style and content conventions:
        - Use the same heading structure, intro, and code block formatting as other guides.
        - Use Starlight's Markdown asides (triple colon syntax) for notes, tips, cautions, and warnings ([see docs](mdc:https:/starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#asides)).
        - Use Astro Starlight tab components for alternative instructions (e.g., package manager differences).
        - Reference and link to other docs where relevant.
        - Test the docs site locally to ensure the new page appears in the sidebar and is accessible.

examples:
  - input: |
      Used `>` for notes and tips in the new guide.
    output: |
      Use Starlight's Markdown asides (triple colon syntax, e.g., `:::tip ... :::`) for notes and tips.

  - input: |
      Added a new guide but did not follow the directory or sidebar requirements.

      See the [docs-location] rule for correct file placement and sidebar navigation requirements.
