# Writing tests

- When writing tests, focus on decoupling each `it` or `test` block to ensure that they can run independently and concurrently. Tests must never depend on the action or outcome of previous or subsequent tests.
- When writing tests, especially in the __tests__/server directory, ensure that you avoid `pruneDatabase` calls.
