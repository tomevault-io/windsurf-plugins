# General Rules

## UI

- Inconsistent or missing use of Tailwind responsive and state variants can cause poor mobile or interactive experience. Audit for missing responsive prefixes (e.g., md:, lg:) and state classes (hover:, focus:).
- Lack of spacing utilities (e.g., space-y-4, gap-x-2) can lead to cramped or uneven layouts. Check for hardcoded margins/paddings or missing layout classes.
- Absence of semantic HTML elements (e.g., using divs instead of buttons/links for actions) can reduce accessibility and clarity.

## UX

- Manual form handling or data fetching in components (useEffect, fetch in component) is an anti-pattern. All data loading and form actions should use loader/action and <Form> from react-router.
- Navigation links should use <Link> or <NavLink> from react-router, never raw <a> tags or manual string URLs.
- Missing <Outlet /> in layout routes prevents child routes from rendering, breaking navigation hierarchy.
- No global or local loading/pending UI (e.g., using useNavigation for spinners) can make the app feel unresponsive.

## Maintainability

- Route type imports must always use ./+types/[routeName]. Any deviation (../+types/ or ../../+types/) will break type safety and autogeneration.
- Never manually construct URLs for navigation or redirects. Always use href() for type-safe, maintainable links.
- Avoid custom route type definitions. Use only the generated Route types.
- Ensure all new/renamed routes are followed by bun typecheck to generate types.
- Avoid legacy or deprecated packages (react-router-dom, @remix-run/*, React Router v6 patterns).

## Security

- Forms should use <Form method="post"> and not rely on custom JS handlers, to prevent CSRF and ensure progressive enhancement.
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in loader return values or clientLoader fetches.
- Validate and sanitize all formData in action/clientAction handlers before processing or storing.

## More

All of these can be checked and fixed in short time by:

- Auditing imports and usage of react-router and Tailwind classes.
- Replacing manual data fetching/form handling with loader/action and <Form>.
- Running bun typecheck after route changes.
- Ensuring all navigation uses <Link> and href().
- Adding missing responsive, state, and spacing classes in UI components.
- Verifying semantic HTML and accessibility basics.
- Reviewing loader/action for data exposure and input validation.
