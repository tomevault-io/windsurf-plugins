# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Cyto is a rust-based bioinformatics tool for processing 10x Genomics Flex single-cell RNA sequencing data. It handles gene expression profiling, multiplexed experiments (16-plex Flex-V1, 384-plex Flex-V2), and CRISPR perturbation screens (Perturb-seq). Supports both FASTQ and BINSEQ input formats.

BINSEQ is a binary format that is a modern replacement for FASTQ.
It is natively parallel, more compressed, and has both paired-end and single-end support in a single file.
The main extension used by cyto is `.cbq`.
Interaction with these files is handled via the CLI `bqtools`.

IBU (Indexed-Barcode-UMI) is a binary format that is similar to a BUS file or a very minimal BAM.
When probe demultiplexing is enabled, cyto writes one IBU file per probe; without probes, a single IBU file is written.
This is a deterministically sized format with a HEADER, and then many 24-byte records, each containing a BARCODE and UMI (2-bit encoded as u64 values) and a u64 representing the library element mapped by the record.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install with SIMD optimization (recommended for performance)
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"; cargo install --path crates/cyto

# Or use justfile
just install
```

### Dependencies

Not strictly necessary but recommended: `bqtools`

- If not installed, run `cargo install bqtools`

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --verbose

# Run tests for specific crate
cargo test -p cyto-map

# Run specific test by name
cargo test test_name

# Run a map test (uses data/ directory)
just run-gex-binseq    # Gene expression workflow
just run-crispr-binseq # CRISPR workflow

# Run workflow integration tests (uses data/ directory)
just run-wf-gex      # Gene expression workflow
just run-wf-crispr   # CRISPR workflow
just run-all         # All test workflows
```

### Test Data

The repository contains relevant test data in the `data/` directory.

Example data in `data/` directory:

- `data/sequencing/` - CRISPR and GEX BINSEQ/FASTQ files
  - Expected format: [.bq/.vbq/.cbq or \*\_R[12].fastq.gz]
  - Minimal test files for CI
- `data/libraries/` - CRISPR guides and GEX probes
  - Format: [TSV]
- `data/metadata/` - Probe barcodes and cell barcode whitelist
  - Whitelist format (one sequence per line): [.txt.gz]
  - Probe format: [3-col TSV]

## Linting and Formatting

```bash
cargo clippy
cargo fmt
```

Workspace uses pedantic clippy lints with specific exceptions defined in root Cargo.toml.

## Architecture

### Crate Organization (11 crates in `crates/`)

**Entry Points:**

- `cyto` - Main binary, module selection, logger init
- `cyto-cli` - CLI definitions using Clap

**Processing Pipeline:**

- `cyto-map` - Maps reads to features (barcode correction, optional probe demux, geometry handling)
- `cyto-workflow` - Orchestrates multi-step pipelines (gex, crispr workflows)
- `cyto-io` - File I/O utilities

**IBU (Index-Barcode-UMI) Format Processing:**

- `cyto-ibu-count` - Counting and deduplication
- `cyto-ibu-sort` - In-memory and external sorting
- `cyto-ibu-umi-correct` - UMI error correction
- `cyto-ibu-cat` - Concatenate IBU files
- `cyto-ibu-view` - View IBU contents as text
- `cyto-ibu-reads` - Read/UMI statistics

### Command Hierarchy

```
cyto
├── workflow
│   ├── gex        # map → sort → umi-correct → count → filter
│   └── crispr     # map → sort → umi-correct → count → assign
├── map
│   ├── gex        # Map to gene expression library
│   └── crispr     # Map to CRISPR guides
├── detect
│   ├── gex        # Auto-detect GEX read geometry
│   └── crispr     # Auto-detect CRISPR read geometry
└── ibu
    ├── view, sort, count, cat, umi, reads
```

### Geometry DSL

Read geometry is specified via a domain-specific language:

- Presets: `gex-v1`, `gex-v2`, `crispr-v1`, `crispr-v2`
- Components: `[barcode]`, `[umi:N]`, `[probe]`, `[gex]`, `[anchor]`, `[protospacer]`
- Skip regions: `[:N]` for anonymous spacers
- Custom via `--geometry` flag

### Key Source Files

- `crates/cyto/src/main.rs` - Entry point, command routing
- `crates/cyto-workflow/src/lib.rs` - Workflow orchestration (gex.rs, crispr.rs)
- `crates/cyto-map/src/mapper/mod.rs` - Mapper implementations (GexMapper, CrisprMapper, WhitelistMapper)
- `crates/cyto-map/src/geometry.rs` - Geometry DSL parsing

## Maintaining CLAUDE.md Files

Each crate in `crates/` has its own `CLAUDE.md` describing that module's purpose, key types, source files, and design patterns. These files must stay accurate as the code evolves.

When making changes to a crate, check whether the diff affects anything described in that crate's `CLAUDE.md`:

- Renamed or removed functions, types, or traits that are listed as key types or referenced in source file descriptions
- New source files added or existing ones restructured
- Changed design patterns (e.g., new parallelism strategy, different error handling approach)
- Added or removed dependencies on other workspace crates
- New or removed tests

If the diff touches any of these, update the relevant `CLAUDE.md` as part of the same change. Keep descriptions concise and factual — these files are reference material, not prose documentation.
