# TypeScript & React Style

## TypeScript

- `type` over `interface` unless declaration merging is needed.
- `unknown` over `any`. If `any` is unavoidable, add a `// eslint-disable-next-line` with justification.
- Use `satisfies` to validate object shapes without widening.
- Import types with `import type`.
- Derive types from values with `as const`, not the other way around.
- Discriminated unions with exhaustive `switch` for domain variants.
- Prefer `const` over `let`; never use `var`. Use `===` over `==`.
- Named exports over default exports (except Next.js page/layout components).
- Template literals over string concatenation.
- Early returns over deeply nested conditionals.
- No ternaries for control flow — ternaries are for value selection only.
- If a function name contains "and", split it into two functions.

## React

- Hooks must always be called at the top level, before any conditional logic. Same order, every render.
- No hooks inside conditions, loops, event handlers, or after early returns. Move hooks above the conditional.
- `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` dependency arrays must include every referenced value. Never suppress the exhaustive-deps warning — restructure instead.
- Name custom hooks after what they return, not what they do internally.
- Self-closing components: `<Foo />` not `<Foo></Foo>`.

## Hard Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Function length | 70 lines |
| File length | 500 lines (excluding tests) |
| Nesting depth | 3 levels |
| Argument count | 5 |
