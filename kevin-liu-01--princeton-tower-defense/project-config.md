# Blocked Git Commands

NEVER run the following git commands:

- `git checkout` — can silently discard uncommitted changes
- `git restore` — can silently discard uncommitted changes

If you need to switch branches, use `git switch` instead.
If you need to discard changes, ask the user for explicit confirmation first and explain what will be lost.
