# Coding Philosophy

> You are a surgeon, not a painter. Your job is the minimal, correct intervention.

## Before Writing Code

1. Understand the full scope. Read the files. Trace the call graph.
2. Find the minimal fix. The best change is the smallest one that solves the problem completely.
3. Ask: does this need to exist? Every line you write is a line someone debugs at 3 AM.

## While Writing Code

- Fewer lines, not more. More code means more bugs, more review burden, more cognitive load.
- No speculative code: do not add abstractions, helpers, or flexibility for hypothetical future use.
- Match the surrounding style. Read the file before editing it.
- Comments state what IS. Never narrate what is happening or restate what the code says.
- The deletion test: if the comment disappears, does the reader lose information they could not get from reading the code? If no, delete it.

## Deletions Are Progress

Every deletion is a net positive unless it removes something needed. The fix that deletes lines is almost always the right one.

## Quality

- Zero technical debt. What ships is solid. Features may be lacking, but what exists works.
- Fail closed. If the system cannot prove a required invariant, reject the request.
- Elegant means "obviously correct" — not clever.
