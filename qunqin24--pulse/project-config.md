# Gemini

Profiled provider: [`Sources/Pulse/Providers/Profiled/GeminiUsageService.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Providers/Profiled/GeminiUsageService.swift). User setup: [../setup/gemini.md](../setup/gemini.md).

- **Credential:** `localLogin` — the access token Gemini CLI saved in `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`. `~/.gemini/settings.json` is read only for `security.auth.selectedType` (or the older `selectedAuthType`): `gemini-api-key`, `api-key` or `vertex-ai` means there is no Google login → "Sign in with this service's own app…". A missing or unparseable credentials file is the same. A missing `access_token`, or an `expiry_date` (milliseconds) at or before now, is "The saved login has expired" and nothing is sent.
- **Never renewed.** CodexBar refreshes an expired token by extracting `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` from the installed CLI's JavaScript and writing the new token back to `oauth_creds.json`. Pulse does neither: another tool's token is read, not refreshed. The consequence is that the reading lapses about an hour after Gemini CLI was last used.
- **Route:** two POSTs with the bearer token, JSON bodies, 15 s timeout.
  1. `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:loadCodeAssist`, body `{"metadata":{"ideType":"GEMINI_CLI","pluginType":"GEMINI"}}`. Best-effort: 401 is an expired login; a non-2xx body naming `UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT` / `IneligibleTierError` is "no plan"; any other failure carries on without a project. Read: `cloudaicompanionProject` (string, or object with `id`/`projectId`), `paidTier.name` then `currentTier.name` as the plan, and whether `ineligibleTiers[].reasonCode/reasonMessage` flags this client with no `currentTier` and no `paidTier`.
  2. `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuota`, body `{"project":"<id>"}` or `{}`. 401 → expired login; 403 → "no plan" if step 1 flagged the client or the body names the shutdown, otherwise an expired login; the rest through `ProfileHTTP.classify`.
- **Reply:** `{ buckets: [{ modelId, tokenType, remainingFraction, resetTime }] }`.
- **Windows:** one per `modelId`, scoped by that id, at the lowest `remainingFraction` of its buckets (with that bucket's `resetTime`). `usedFraction = 1 − remainingFraction`. Kind `.daily` because Google publishes Gemini CLI quotas as daily ones, but the reply states no length, so `reportsLength: false` and the day is a sort key only. Sorted by model id.
- **Figures:** a bucket with no model, or a fraction missing, outside 0…1 or not finite, is left off. None left is "No limits reported"; no `buckets` array is "Couldn't read the reply".
- **Left out:** CodexBar's Pro / Flash / Flash Lite grouping (its own families, not Google's); its fallback project discovery through `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects`, which guesses a project by name prefix; the account email from the `id_token`; the legacy `/stats` text parser; token refresh (above).
- **Evidence:** second-hand. The shape comes from CodexBar's Gemini provider, `docs/gemini.md` and its tests (MIT); no live account has been read. Fixtures: `Tests/PulseTests/Fixtures/gemini-*.json`.
