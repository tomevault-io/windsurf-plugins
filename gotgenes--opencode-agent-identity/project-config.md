# AGENTS Guide: opencode-agent-identity

## Project Overview

An npm package providing two [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) plugins that improve agent identity awareness in multi-agent sessions:
one injects agent identity into the system prompt, the other exposes a tool for querying per-message agent attribution via the SDK.
Small library — a handful of source files.

**Runtime:** Bun (development, building, testing) / Node.js (published target)
**Test framework:** Bun's built-in test runner (`bun test`)
**Module format:** ESM (`"type": "module"`)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run check` | TypeScript type checking |
| `bun run lint` | Biome linting + formatting + import sorting |
| `bun run lint:fix` | Auto-fix all Biome issues |
| `bun run lint:md` | Markdown linting |
| `bun run lint:all` | All lint checks (Biome + markdownlint) |
| `bun run format` | Format all files |
| `bun run test` | Run tests |
| `bun run build` | Build the package |

## Code Conventions

- **Formatting and linting:** Biome handles formatting, linting, and import sorting. Config in `biome.json`.
- **Import style:** Use `import type { X }` (not `import { type X }`). Biome enforces this.
- **Test files:** `noExplicitAny` and `noNonNullAssertion` are disabled in `*.test.ts` files. Tests use `as any` casts for two reasons: the SDK v1 types lack the `agent` field that exists at runtime (see `src/types.ts`), and plugin tests pass partial mocks for `PluginInput` and `ToolContext`.
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Managed by [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) (`prek.toml`). Run `prek install` after cloning.
- **Dependency versions:** Use caret (`^`) ranges in `package.json`. The `bun.lock` lockfile ensures reproducible installs; exact pins are redundant.

## Architecture

The package exports two independent OpenCode plugins from `src/index.ts`:

| Plugin | File | Mechanism | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentSelfIdentityPlugin` | `src/agent-self-identity.ts` | Two hooks with session-scoped shared state | Injects `You are currently operating as the "X" agent.` into the system prompt so models know which agent they are |
| `AgentAttributionToolPlugin` | `src/agent-attribution-tool.ts` | Tool registration via `tool()` | Exposes an `agent_attribution` tool that returns a numbered list of all messages in the session; user messages show only the role, assistant messages include the agent name and provider/model (with variant when present) |

**AgentSelfIdentityPlugin** uses a two-phase hook pattern:

1. `messages.transform` (fires first) — reads the agent name from the last user message's `info.agent` field and stores it in a `Map<sessionID, agentName>`.
2. `system.transform` (fires second) — looks up the agent name by session ID, appends the identity line, and deletes the Map entry (one-shot per turn).

State is keyed by session ID so concurrent sessions don't interfere.

**AgentAttributionToolPlugin** calls `client.session.messages()` via the OpenCode SDK to fetch all messages. The `agent` field on user messages reflects which agent the message was routed to (not which agent processed it), so only assistant attribution is shown. When a `variant` field is present on an assistant message (e.g., `"high"`), it is appended to the model identifier in parentheses: `anthropic/claude-opus-4 (high)`.

Shared types live in `src/types.ts` — see [SDK Type Gap](#sdk-type-gap) below.

## Build Pipeline

The build has two steps (both run by `bun run build`):

1. `bun build src/index.ts --outdir dist --target node --format esm` — bundles the source into a single `dist/index.js`.
2. `tsc --project tsconfig.build.json` — emits `.d.ts` declaration files to `dist/`.

`tsconfig.json` is for development (`noEmit`, `bun-types` included).
`tsconfig.build.json` extends it, overrides to `emitDeclarationOnly`, and excludes test files.

The package publishes the `dist/` directory and `MIGRATION.md` (per the `files` field in `package.json`).
Single entry point: `dist/index.js` (code) + `dist/index.d.ts` (types).

## Testing Patterns

Tests use Bun's built-in test runner.
Run a single test file with `bun test src/agent-self-identity.test.ts`.

Both test files use partial mocks — they construct minimal objects that satisfy only the fields the plugin actually reads, cast with `as any` to bypass the full type contracts:

- **Self-identity tests** pass hand-crafted message arrays to the hook functions directly, simulating the `messages.transform` → `system.transform` lifecycle.
- **Attribution tests** mock the SDK `client` by providing a `client.session.messages()` function that returns canned responses.
  The `context` object is a partial mock with just `sessionID`.

When writing new tests, follow these patterns rather than attempting to construct fully-typed `PluginInput` or `ToolContext` objects.

## SDK Type Gap

The OpenCode plugin SDK (`@opencode-ai/plugin` v1) re-exports types from `@opencode-ai/sdk` v1, which lacks some fields present in v2.
The `agent` field exists at runtime on both message types but is missing from v1 type definitions.
The `variant` field (the specific model variant/snapshot, e.g., `"high"`) also exists at runtime but is absent from v1 types.
