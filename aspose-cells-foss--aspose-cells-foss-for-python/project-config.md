# Aspose.Cells for Python Development Guide for AI Agents

You are a senior Python engineer working on a pure-Python Excel library. Prioritize Excel compatibility, round-trip fidelity, and small, reviewable diffs.

## Do

- Treat [`aspose/cells_foss/`](./aspose/cells_foss) as the source of truth for library behavior and public API
- Treat [`examples/`](./examples) as executable usage coverage; keep examples aligned with the current API
- Use A1-style string references for cell access: `ws.cells["A1"]`
- Preserve loaded workbook content when it was not modified, especially XML parts cached on objects such as `_source_xml`
- Add new workbook features through the existing loader/saver split: `xml_<feature>_loader.py` and `xml_<feature>_saver.py`
- Keep worksheet XML in ECMA-376-compatible element order when adding new nodes
- Use `SaveFormat` or file extensions consistently when saving workbooks
- Add or update example coverage when changing user-facing behavior in `aspose/cells_foss/`
- Prefer stdlib modules already used by the repo (`xml.etree.ElementTree`, `zipfile`) over new dependencies
- Run targeted tests for the area you changed before finishing

## Don't

- Never use tuple-based cell keys like `ws.cells[0, 0]`
- Never regenerate XML for loaded objects that were not changed if preserved source XML is available
- Never change public exports in [`aspose/cells_foss/__init__.py`](./aspose/cells_foss/__init__.py) without verifying the API impact
- Never add third-party dependencies without approval
- Never commit generated `.xlsx` files or contents from `outputfiles/`
- Never hard-code behavior in examples that contradicts the implementation in `aspose/cells_foss/`
- Never add comments that only restate the code

## PR Size Guidelines

Keep changes focused and easy to review.

- **Lines changed**: Prefer under 500 lines of code
- **Files changed**: Prefer under 10 code files
- **Single responsibility**: One feature, bugfix, or refactor per change

When the task is larger, split it by:

1. Core model/API changes in `aspose/cells_foss/`
2. XML load/save wiring
3. Example coverage in `examples/`

## Commands

Key commands:

```bash
python -m pytest examples -v
python -m pytest examples/test_<feature>.py -v
```

## Boundaries

### Always do

- Read the relevant modules in `aspose/cells_foss/` before changing behavior
- Update matching examples in `examples/` when you change a public workflow
- Run relevant tests for the changed area
- Preserve backward-compatible API behavior unless the task explicitly requires a change

### Ask first

- Adding dependencies
- Changing public class names, method signatures, or exported symbols
- Deleting or renaming source files
- Large cross-cutting refactors across multiple workbook features

### Never do

- Commit secrets, credentials, or local machine paths
- Commit generated files from `outputfiles/`
- Replace preserved source XML with regenerated XML unless the object was actually modified
- Use tuple-style cell addressing

## Project Structure

```text
aspose/cells_foss/         # Library source code (canonical location)
  __init__.py              # Public exports
  workbook.py              # Workbook entry point and save/load dispatch
  worksheet.py             # Worksheet model
  cell.py / cells.py       # Cell model and A1-keyed collection
  style.py                 # Font, fill, border, alignment, number format
  chart.py                 # Chart models and enums
  picture.py / shape.py    # Drawing objects
  table.py                 # Excel table support
  sparkline.py             # Sparkline support
  data_validation.py       # Validation models and enums
  auto_filter.py           # Filter models
  document_properties.py   # Core and extended document properties
  workbook_properties.py   # Workbook-level settings and protection
  csv_handler.py           # CSV import/export
  markdown_handler.py      # Markdown export
  json_handler.py          # JSON export
  xml_loader.py            # Workbook XML loading
  xml_saver.py             # Workbook XML saving
  xml_*_loader.py          # Feature-specific XML loaders
  xml_*_saver.py           # Feature-specific XML savers
examples/                  # Executable example tests for library features
  outputfiles/             # Output from examples/ tests
```

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.7+
- **Workbook format**: `.xlsx` / ECMA-376 Open XML
- **XML**: `xml.etree.ElementTree`
- **Archives**: `zipfile`
- **Encryption**: `pycryptodome`
- **Encrypted container support**: `olefile`
- **Testing**: `pytest`, `unittest`
- **Excel verification**: `pywin32` via `verify/check_open_xlsx.py`

## Code Examples

### Good cell access

```python
wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.worksheets[0]
ws.cells["A1"].value = "Revenue"
ws.cells["B2"].value = 42
```

### Bad cell access

```python
ws.cells[0, 0].value = "Revenue"
```

### Good feature extension pattern

```python
# Add model behavior in aspose/cells_foss/<feature>.py
# Load existing files in aspose/cells_foss/xml_<feature>_loader.py
# Save new or modified content in aspose/cells_foss/xml_<feature>_saver.py
```
