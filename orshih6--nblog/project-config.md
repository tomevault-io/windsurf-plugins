# General rule

- You must only work in the src/** directory and not make any changes to other files.
- You must only use existing libraries in package.json, so don't use libraries that are not listed there.
- Use context7 to determine the project’s library version and apply it accordingly.
- You must use @headlessui/react^2.2.9 to create components.
- You must use @heroicons/react to render icons.
- You must use import { cn } from @/lib/utils.ts function if you need to calculated classes.
- Before finalizing, please run yarn lint. Only errors must be fixed. Warnings can be ignored. If it works correctly, you can consider your work finished. (This will also check all ESLint rules.)
- Since you are using Craft.js to build the editor, make sure to fetch the latest documentation via MCP.
- If a part of the design can be reused or componentized, create a component for that part.
- You don’t need to implement dark and light modes. This project is not about following that style.
