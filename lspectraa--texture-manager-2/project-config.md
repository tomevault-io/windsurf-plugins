description: Enforce IronBee DevTools for driving and verifying running applications. Each enabled platform (browser, node, backend) contributes its own section. Verify changes against the running app before finishing; use execute for multi-step flows.

# Use IronBee DevTools to drive and verify the running application

**IronBee DevTools** is the verification and intelligence layer for this workspace. It is exposed as up
to three MCP servers — one per platform enabled in the extension settings
(`ironbeeDevTools.platform.<browser|node|backend>.enable`):

- **Browser** (`ironbee-dt-browser`) — Playwright control of a real browser.
- **Node** (`ironbee-dt-node`) — non-blocking debugging of Node.js processes.
- **Backend** (`ironbee-dt-backend`) — runtime-agnostic backend verification (HTTP/gRPC/GraphQL/WebSocket) + log capture + database inspection.

Only the platforms enabled for this project have a running MCP server. The section for each enabled
platform appears below; a disabled platform's section is left as an HTML comment and has no effect.
**Do not invoke a platform's tools when that platform's section below is still a comment** — there is
no MCP server backing it.

## Verify your changes against the running application before finishing

Before you consider a task complete, **verify the change against the actual running system** — never
rely on reading code alone. Use the platform that matches what you changed (see the enabled platform
sections below for the exact tools and flow).

- **Do not verify after every file edit.** Implement first, then verify once at the end.
- If verification reveals a problem, fix it and verify again before finishing.
- Skip verification **only** when the change has zero observable runtime effect (e.g. CI config, docs-only, non-app tooling).

## Use Execute for multi-step flows

- **Prefer the `execute` tool** for any flow that needs more than 2–3 sequential tool calls. Batch with `await callTool(name, input, returnOutput?)`.
- **Use individual tool calls only** when you must inspect a result before deciding the next action.
- **Do not issue long sequences of separate MCP calls** when one or two execute scripts express the same flow.
- **Scenario** tools (`scenario_*`) save and replay reusable flows.

<!--IRONBEE:PLATFORM:browser-->
<!-- Browser platform is ENABLED for this project (ironbee-dt-browser MCP server). -->

## Browser platform: only IronBee DevTools

**For any browser-related work you MUST use only the IronBee DevTools browser tools.** It is
**FORBIDDEN** to use:

- Cursor's built-in browser agent, MCP, or skill
- Any other external browser agent, MCP, or skill

Navigation, screenshots, form filling, testing, debugging, or any web interaction must go through
IronBee DevTools browser tools only.

### Browser tools

- **Navigation** – go to URL, reload, back/forward (`navigation_*`)
- **Content** – full-page or element screenshots, HTML/text, PDF, video (`content_*`)
- **Interaction** – click, fill, hover, scroll, keyboard, drag, select (`interaction_*`)
- **Accessibility** – ARIA / AX tree snapshots; refs from `a11y_take-aria-snapshot` drive interaction (`a11y_*`)
- **Observability** – Web Vitals, console messages, HTTP requests, trace IDs (`o11y_*`)
- **Stubbing** – mock HTTP responses, intercept requests (`stub_*`)
- **Sync** – wait for network idle (`sync_*`)
- **React** – component / element inspection (`react_*`); **Figma** – compare page to design (`figma_*`); **Debug** – tracepoints, logpoints, exceptionpoints, probe snapshots (`debug_*`)

### Verify a UI change

Open the affected page (`navigation_go-to`) → functionally exercise the change (click / fill / submit —
not just look at it) → confirm with a screenshot (`content_take-screenshot`) and/or an ARIA snapshot
(`a11y_take-aria-snapshot`) → check `o11y_get-console-messages` for errors. Prefer one `execute` script
when the flow is more than 2–3 calls.

<!--IRONBEE:PLATFORM:node-->
<!-- Node platform is ENABLED for this project (ironbee-dt-node MCP server). -->

## Node platform: non-blocking Node.js debugging

Verify Node.js runtime behavior with the IronBee DevTools node tools (`debug_*`) instead of guessing
from code. Attach to a running process, set non-blocking probes at the changed code, exercise the path
so the probe fires, and read the snapshots.

### ⚠️ Node tools are ONLY for Node.js runtimes

`debug_*` wraps the V8 inspector. It does NOT work for Java, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, .NET, PHP, or any
other runtime. If you see `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`,
`Cargo.toml`, etc., the backend is not Node.js — do not call `debug_*`; use the backend platform
instead.

### Node tools & flow

- **Connect** by PID, process name, port, WebSocket URL, or Docker container (`debug_connect`).
- **Probe** the changed code without pausing it: `debug_put-tracepoint` / `debug_put-logpoint` /
  `debug_put-exceptionpoint`, then exercise the path and read `debug_get-probe-snapshots` (or
  `debug_get-logs`).
- **Resolve** bundled/minified stack frames to original source with `debug_resolve-source-location`.
- **Disconnect** (`debug_disconnect`) when done.

Pass criteria: the process connected and a probe actually triggered (or a log path was used with no
unexpected ERROR entries).
