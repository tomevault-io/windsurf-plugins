# Agent entrypoint

Before changing this project, read these files in order:

1. `HANDOFF.md` — current status, architecture, verified behavior, and next steps.
2. `docs/MYUCLA_CONTRACT.md` — exact fail-closed MyUCLA DOM/button contract.
3. `PRIVACY.md` — allowed data and storage boundaries.

Non-negotiable rules:

- Never click or automate Enroll, Drop, Remove, Exchange, or Waitlist.
- Never request, inspect, log, or store passwords, cookies, tokens, UID, grades, DARS, or Duo data.
- Do not add polling or extra MyUCLA requests without explicit user approval and a fresh privacy review.
- Keep the exact Class Planner path permission; do not broaden to all MyUCLA pages.
- Reordering must use the strictly validated native up/down buttons and retain user confirmation.
- If the MyUCLA DOM contract changes, fail closed. Do not replace exact checks with fuzzy button matching.
- Do not copy real course names or account-specific page content into fixtures, logs, screenshots, or commits.

Required checks before handoff:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --run
npm run build
```

The project lives at https://github.com/Astro-wen/better-myucla-planner. Anyone may
