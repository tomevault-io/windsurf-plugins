## Turn Structure

The game uses a 6-state turn system with 3 phases per round, alternating between players:

| Phase | German Name      | Description                                    |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Bewegungsphase   | Movement phase - full movement points          |
| 1     | Angriffsphase    | Attack phase - movement restricted to 1        |
| 2     | Torphase         | Gate/Fortification phase - build on own territory |

**State Machine:** Combined state = `(GAME_STATE * 2) + CURRENT_PLAYER + 1`

| State | Phase | Player  | Action                              |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| 1     | 0     | Eldoin  | Movement                            |
| 2     | 0     | Dailor  | Movement                            |
| 3     | 1     | Eldoin  | Attack (movement=1)                 |
| 4     | 1     | Dailor  | Attack (movement=1)                 |
| 5     | 2     | Eldoin  | Fortification (Y < 60)              |
| 6     | 2     | Dailor  | Fortification (Y >= 60), end round  |
