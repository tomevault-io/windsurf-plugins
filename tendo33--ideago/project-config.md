description: Performance optimization patterns for utility functions including caching, lazy evaluation, and async operations.
---

- Use @lru_cache for expensive pure functions that are called repeatedly.
- Implement lazy evaluation for costly operations that may not always be needed.
- Use generators and iterators for processing large datasets to save memory.
- Prefer list comprehensions over map/filter for simple transformations.
- Use async def for I/O-bound operations (file I/O, network calls).
- Avoid premature optimization; profile first with cProfile or py-spy.
- Cache compiled regex patterns at module level.
- Use appropriate data structures (set for membership tests, dict for lookups).
- Minimize function call overhead in hot paths.
- Use str.join() instead of repeated string concatenation.
- Read files in binary mode when text encoding is not needed.
- Use pathlib.Path for file operations (more efficient than os.path).
- Batch operations when possible to reduce overhead.
- Consider using slots for frequently instantiated classes to reduce memory.
- Use context managers to ensure proper resource cleanup.
