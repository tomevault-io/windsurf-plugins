description: Best practices for creating and using decorators for cross-cutting concerns like timing, retry logic, and logging.
---

- Use functools.wraps to preserve function metadata in decorators.
- Create generic, reusable decorators that work with any function signature.
- Use *args and **kwargs to support flexible function signatures.
- Provide configurable decorators with default parameters.
- Implement timing_decorator for performance monitoring.
- Create retry_decorator with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- Build log_calls decorator for automatic function call logging.
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous functions in decorators.
- Handle exceptions properly within decorators; don't swallow errors silently.
- Use type hints in decorator signatures for better IDE support.
- Document decorator parameters and behavior in docstrings.
- Keep decorators focused on single concerns (timing, logging, retry, etc.).
- Make decorators stackable and composable.
- Consider performance impact; avoid expensive operations in decorators.
- Test decorators independently with various function types.
