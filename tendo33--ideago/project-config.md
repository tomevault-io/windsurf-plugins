description: Project-wide engineering contract across backend and frontend work.
---

- **Read `ai_docs/` for project standards.** `ai_docs/AI_TOOLING_STANDARDS.md` has the full index.
- Backend: `ai_docs/BACKEND_STANDARDS.md`. Frontend: `ai_docs/FRONTEND_STANDARDS.md`.
- Scripts (rename/version): `ai_docs/SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md`.
- Plan first, implement minimal changes, and verify before completion.
- Backend default: Python 3.10+, uv, ruff, pytest.
- Frontend default: pnpm + React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.
- Keep functions typed, explicit, and testable.
- Handle failures explicitly; avoid silent exception swallowing.
