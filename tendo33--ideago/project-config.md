description: Testing best practices using pytest with comprehensive coverage and proper test organization.
---

- Use pytest as the testing framework for all tests.
- Organize tests to mirror source code structure (e.g., test_date_utils.py for date_utils.py).
- Use descriptive test function names that explain what is being tested (e.g., test_format_datetime_with_custom_format).
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in test functions.
- Use pytest fixtures in conftest.py for shared test data and setup.
- Mark tests appropriately (@pytest.mark.slow, @pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.unit).
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%) but prioritize meaningful tests over coverage metrics.
- Use parametrize for testing multiple input scenarios efficiently.
- Mock external dependencies using pytest-mock or unittest.mock.
- Test both happy paths and edge cases (empty inputs, None values, invalid data).
- Use tmp_path fixture for file system tests.
- Test error handling with pytest.raises().
- Keep tests isolated and independent; avoid test interdependencies.
- Run tests with coverage: pytest --cov=python_template --cov-report=html.
