description: Enforces general Python coding style guidelines for utility library development, emphasizing functional programming and type safety.
---

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes except for Pydantic BaseModel and necessary data structures.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_valid, has_data, should_retry).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., utils/date_utils.py).
- Favor named exports for utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures (parameters and return types).
- All models in the models/ directory MUST inherit from Pydantic BaseModel for validation and serialization.
- Prefer Pydantic models for configuration and data validation over raw dictionaries.
- Use Optional[T] explicitly instead of T | None for better Python 3.8+ compatibility.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity in conditional statements.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes.
- Use docstrings (Google style) for all public functions and classes.
