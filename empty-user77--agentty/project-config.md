# Agentty — rules for AI assistants and contributors

## Secrets (highest priority, no exceptions)

1. **Never put a real credential in the repository** — not in code, tests, fixtures, docs, comments, commit messages or
   screenshots. This includes API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, cookies and session IDs.
2. **Never copy values from the user's environment.** `~/.claude.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `.env*`, the Keychain,
   MCP server arguments, shell history and terminal output may contain real credentials. If you see one, do not repeat
   it in code, tests or messages — refer to it as "the Figma token in ~/.claude.json" instead.
3. **Test fixtures use obviously fake values** that contain a marker such as `example`, `not_a_real`, `fake`, `dummy`
   or `placeholder` — e.g. `figd_example_not_a_real_key`, `ghp_example_not_a_real_token`. Build credential-shaped
   strings at runtime if a test needs a realistic length.
4. **Do not print secrets** in commands you run (no `cat ~/.claude.json`, `env`, `security find-generic-password -w`,
   unmasked `claude mcp list` output). Redact before displaying (`sed -E 's/figd_[A-Za-z0-9_-]+/figd_***/g'`).
5. **Never bypass the checks**: no `git commit --no-verify` / `-n`, no changing `core.hooksPath`, no editing or
   deleting `.githooks/`, `scripts/check-secrets.py`, `scripts/security-audit.py` or `.claude/hooks/`. If a scanner
   flags something, remove the value; if it is a false positive, make the value obviously fake (or add an
   `audit: ok — <reason>` comment for `security-audit.py`) — do not weaken a scanner without the user's OK.
6. **If a secret is ever committed**: stop, tell the user immediately which file/commit, recommend revoking the
   credential, and ask before rewriting history or force-pushing.

App code follows the same principle: secrets live in the macOS Keychain (`agentty-bridge/src/connectors.rs`), UI shows
redacted values (`redact_args`, `redact_url`), and files with conversation data are created `0600`.

## Enforcement (already installed)

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| `.githooks/pre-commit` | `scripts/check-secrets.py --staged` blocks commits that add credentials; `scripts/security-audit.py --staged` blocks files that must never be committed (env files, keys, transcripts, local tool state), real home folder paths, code that weakens a guarantee (agent permission bypass, broad allow rules in idea projects, `--reveal`, hook skipping, `set -x` in credential scripts, `pull_request_target`, non-English prompts), workflows a stranger's pull request could start on a self-hosted runner (SA05 — blocking when that workflow also holds secrets) and unwired guards |
| `.githooks/pre-push` | both scanners over every commit being pushed (catches `--no-verify` commits) |
| `.claude/hooks/guard-secrets.py` | Claude Code PreToolUse hook: blocks writing credentials, credential literals in shell commands, and hook bypasses |
| `.claude/hooks/require-security-audit.py` | Claude Code PreToolUse hook: refuses `git commit` / `git push` until the `security-audit` skill reviewed the staged tree (`security-audit.py --mark`); refuses `git commit -a` and stage-and-commit in one command |
| `.claude/skills/security-audit` | the review that needs judgment: logic and flow, GitHub / Vercel / Supabase integration safety, authorization on local interfaces (BOLA), leak paths, dev / prod separation, everything else |
| `.claude/settings.json` | registers both hooks; denies reading `.env.agentty-prod` and `--no-verify` commits |
| CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | `check-secrets.py --all` and `security-audit.py --all` on every pull request and every push to main |
| PR guard (`.github/workflows/pr-guard.yml`) | every pull request, forks included, read and never run: gitleaks (`.gitleaks.toml`) over its commits, and `scripts/pr-guard.py` from the base branch — plugin modules (`.wasm` ships through the Marketplace only), binaries, scripts outside `scripts/` / `packaging/`, personal data, workflows asking for more than read access, changes to the guards, permission bypasses, dependencies from outside crates.io / npm |

After cloning run `scripts/install-hooks.sh` once (sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks`).

Before every commit and push: stage the change in its own command, run the `security-audit` skill, then commit.

## Git

- Commit or push only when the user explicitly asks. Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, …).
- Never force-push or rewrite history without explicit approval.
- Work that goes on its own branch goes in its own worktree, branched from the project's default branch (`origin/HEAD`,
  usually `main`) — not from whatever branch the main folder has checked out — unless the user asks for another base.

## Project conventions

- Rust workspace: `crates/agentty-app` (GPUI UI) and `crates/agentty-bridge` (sessions, usage, git, connectors).
- The Rust toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (used locally and in CI). Never work with an older local toolchain.
- Before handing work back or pushing, run exactly what CI runs and make it pass:
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`,
