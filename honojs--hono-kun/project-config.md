# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (and humans) working on this repository.

## What is Hono-kun?

Hono-kun is an AI maintainer for [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono), deployed as Cloudflare Workers. Its first feature is pull request triage, but nothing in the architecture may be PR-specific: issue triage, issue reproduction, coding, and other maintenance tasks will be added later.

## Current status

Early days. `apps/github` receives GitHub webhook deliveries, verifies their signatures (via `@hono-kun/github`), deduplicates delivery ids in KV, and routes `pull_request` events to `@hono-kun/workflow-pull-request` — where the handler is still a no-op. No PR triage, AI agents, or Cloudflare Sandbox execution is implemented. Do not implement features that have not been requested.

## Architecture rules (do not violate)

1. `apps/github` is the public GitHub-facing Worker; it handles untrusted input from GitHub.
2. `apps/publisher` is the only component allowed to hold privileged GitHub write credentials. All GitHub write operations go through it.
3. Agents must never directly receive GitHub write credentials.
4. `packages/policy` defines interfaces/types only. The real Hono production policy lives in a separate private Worker/repository and will be connected via a Cloudflare Service Binding. This public repository must always build and typecheck without that private policy service.
5. Keep packages minimal. No speculative abstractions; no functionality that has not been requested.
6. Do not add Turborepo, Nx, or similar — plain package.json scripts with `pnpm -r` are enough.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Branch from latest `main`: `<type>/<short-slug>`. `<type>` is `feat` / `fix` / `chore` / `docs` / `refactor`.
2. Implement.
3. Run the quality gates. All must pass:

   ```sh
   pnpm format && pnpm lint:fix
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm test
   ```

   CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same gates (`format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`) on every PR.

4. Commit with conventional commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. Example: `feat(publisher): add comment endpoint`.
5. Open a PR against `main`. Keep the body short: what and why, in a few sentences. No fixed section labels — write it like a human note. Add notes the checklist does not cover as plain sentences. Use bullets only when there are several items. Add `Closes #<n>` only if an issue exists. End the body with the checklist from `.github/pull_request_template.md` and check the items you did.
6. Self-review the diff with the checklist from the PR template before asking for review.

**No AI attribution.** Do not add `Co-Authored-By`, session links, or "Generated with ..." to commits or PR bodies.

One PR = one concern. Do not force-push a branch under review.

## Conventions

- pnpm workspaces; all workspace packages are named `@hono-kun/*` and reference each other with the `workspace:*` protocol.
- No build step for internal packages: `exports` points at TypeScript source (`./src/index.ts`); Workers are bundled by Wrangler.
- TypeScript 7. Every package extends the root `tsconfig.json` and has a `typecheck` script (`tsc --noEmit`). Run `pnpm typecheck` at the root.
- Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (`pnpm test` at the root, `vitest run` per package). Hono apps are tested with `app.request()` — no running server needed.
