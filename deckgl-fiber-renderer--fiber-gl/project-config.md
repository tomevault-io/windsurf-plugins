# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.
**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Project Structure

This is a **Turbo monorepo** with the following structure:

- `packages/*` - Core library packages
- `examples/*` - Example applications

**General guidance:**

- Defer to the `turborepo` skill for guidance on using turborepo/turbo.
- Use pnpm as the package manager (not npm or yarn).
- Defer to the `pnpm` skill for guidance on using pnpm.
- When you install packages, make sure to pass a `--filter` to `pnpm` since this is a monorepo. When in doubt, use the `pnpm` skill.

## Development Workflow

**Building, testing, and linting:**

- Build: `pnpm run build`
- Test: `pnpm run test`
- Lint: `pnpm run lint`
- Format: `pnpm run format`

**Working in specific packages:**
Use Turbo's `--filter` flag to target specific packages:

```bash
pnpm exec turbo test --filter=@deckgl-fiber-renderer/core # package.json "name" in packages/*
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=@deckgl-fiber-renderer/dom # package.json "name" in packages/*
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=examples-nextjs # package.json "name" in examples/*
```

**Testing TypeScript (tsc) for test Files**

You can find and correct typescript errors in test files by pointing to the appropriate tsconfig:

```bash
pnpm --filter=@deckgl-fiber-renderer/reconciler exec tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit
```

Note this is different than vitest typescript type tests.

**Pre-commit hooks:**
This project uses lefthook for pre-commit hooks. Changes are automatically formatted and linted before commit.

## Architecture

**React Reconciler (Persistence Mode):**

This project implements a custom React reconciler for deck.gl using **persistence mode** where existing nodes are never mutated - every change creates a new tree. This is appropriate because deck.gl layers are "descriptor objects that are very cheap to instantiate" and are matched by ID for efficient diffing.

**Critical deck.gl Integration Patterns:**

- **Layer IDs are mandatory**: deck.gl matches layers by ID during diffing. Missing IDs cause expensive re-initialization on every render; duplicate IDs cause silent bugs where the wrong layer gets updated.
- **Layers are descriptors**: deck.gl Layer instances are cheap to create/replace. The reconciler creates new layer instances on prop changes rather than mutating.
- **Views vs Layers**: deck.gl uses View objects for camera/viewport management and Layer objects for rendering. The reconciler must handle both types correctly.

**Common Footguns:**

- Missing layer IDs → expensive re-initialization
- Duplicate layer IDs → incorrect updates during diffing
- Mutating layers instead of replacing them → breaks persistence mode contract

**For more context:** See `openspec/changes/archive/` for detailed architectural decisions and design rationale.

# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `pnpm run format`
- **Check for issues**: `pnpm run lint`
