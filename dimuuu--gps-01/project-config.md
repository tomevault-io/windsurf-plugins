Next.js App Router application. TypeScript, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4. Package manager: **pnpm**.

Canonical project and repository name: `gps-01`. Production is a static export
at `gps-01.dmytro.fyi`; do not introduce a long-running Next.js server unless
the application genuinely requires server-side behavior.

Use pnpm 11. Run `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, and
`pnpm build` before pushing. Direct pushes to `main` are allowed and deploy
only after CI succeeds. Deploy the exact tested `out` artifact; never build
again on the VPS. Keep Umami analytics in the root layout and do not restore
Vercel Analytics.

## Commands

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Dev server | `pnpm dev` |
| Production build | `pnpm build` |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` (ultracite check) |
| Lint + autofix | `pnpm fix` (ultracite fix) |

Ultracite (a strict Biome preset) is the single linter/formatter for this project. `biome.json` extends `ultracite/biome/core`, `ultracite/biome/react`, and `ultracite/biome/next` — do not add ESLint or Prettier. A Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook (`.claude/settings.json`) runs `pnpm run fix` automatically after file edits.

## Structure

- `src/app/` — App Router routes, layouts, global styles
- `public/` — static assets
- `biome.json` — linter/formatter config (extends Ultracite presets)
- `CLAUDE.md` — symlink to this file; keep all agent guidance here

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->
# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `pnpm dlx ultracite fix`
- **Check for issues**: `pnpm dlx ultracite check`
- **Diagnose setup**: `pnpm dlx ultracite doctor`

Biome (the underlying engine) provides robust linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
