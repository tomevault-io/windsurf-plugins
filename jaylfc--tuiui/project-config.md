# tuiui — project memory for coding agents

tuiui is a window manager & desktop for the terminal, in Rust. Floating
windows, dock, cascading launcher, app store (600+ curated TUIs), file
manager, desktop icons, menubar tray, mouse — rendered as cells over a
daemon/client socket, like a graphical tmux.

## Build, test, lint

```sh
cargo build           # MSRV: rust 1.95 (rust-version in Cargo.toml)
cargo test            # 300+ tests; keep them green
cargo clippy --all-targets   # warning-clean; keep it that way
```

There is no rustfmt enforcement; match the style of the file you're editing.
Clippy is currently warning-clean — keep it that way.

## Versioning & release channels

`Cargo.toml` carries the semver version (currently 0.2.14); update `CHANGELOG.md`
in the same commit as user-visible changes (roll `[Unreleased]` into a new
`[x.y.z]` heading).

**Releases are automated — cut one by merging a version bump.** Bump
`Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`, roll the CHANGELOG, open a PR, merge it.
`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on push to `main`; when the version is
new it tags `vX.Y.Z`, builds the four platform binaries, and publishes the
GitHub Release — no manual tag push or `workflow_dispatch` needed (this matters
because the session's automation can open/merge PRs but **cannot push tags or
dispatch workflows** — both return 403). Tag-push and manual dispatch still
work. A guard step **fails the build if the release tag and `Cargo.toml`
version disagree**, so a version-skewed release (which once shipped 0.2.3
binaries under a `v0.2.4` tag → an in-app update loop) can't ship again.

The in-app updater (`update_command` in `session.rs`) has two channels, chosen
by `config.update_branch`:
- **main** — downloads the latest prebuilt release via `install.sh` (fast),
  falling back to `cargo install --git`.
- **dev** — `cargo install --git --branch dev` (source build, for testing).

The updater reloads via the freshly-installed binary's **absolute path** (a
bare `tuiui reload` can miss `$PATH` in the non-interactive `sh -lc` it runs
in) and logs each step (`update: …`) to `~/tuiui-debug.log`. The debug log now
**appends across reloads** — `dbg_init` used to truncate on every daemon start,
wiping the very update trace needed to debug it. The long-standing "update
from Settings gets stuck" report (investigation log:
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-14-update-stuck-investigation.md`) was root-
caused and fixed in 0.2.10: both `install.sh` and `check_for_updates()`
resolved the latest release via the unauthenticated, 60-req/hour
`api.github.com` REST endpoint, which answered a 403 once rate-limited — read
as "no published release yet" and silently dropped Settings' Update & Reload
into a multi-minute source build that looked hung. Both now resolve the tag
from the `github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest` web redirect, which isn't
rate-limited, falling back to the REST API only if that redirect can't be
parsed.

## Architecture (the three processes)

```
client (tuiui)  ←socket→  daemon (tuiui --daemon)  ←socket→  apphost (tuiui --apphost)
thin renderer              owns SessionCore (all UI state)    owns the PTY apps
real terminal              composites frames, routes input    survives UI reloads
```

- **client** (`src/client.rs`, `src/main.rs`): sets up the terminal, turns
  `FrameMsg` diffs into ANSI, forwards input as `ClientMsg`. Holds NO session
  state — it routes keys using the `Flags` the daemon sends each frame.
  `main.rs` is also where ssh "system switches" run (the client owns the real
  terminal, so interactive prompts work there and nowhere else).
- **daemon** (`src/daemon.rs`): serves one client at a time; out-of-band
  control socket accepts any `ClientMsg` (the `tuiui launch/tile/theme/msg`
  CLI and the AI assistant use it).
- **session** (`src/session.rs`, the big one): `SessionCore` is the
  `ClientMsg`-in / frame-out boundary. All UI widgets live here as fields.
- **apphost** (`src/apphost/`, `src/ptyhost.rs`): PTY children behind the
  `AppHost` trait; `LocalAppHost` in-process, `RemoteAppHost` over a socket.
  Apps survive frontend reloads because this process never restarts. The
  emulator keeps 10k lines of scrollback; `AppInstance::scroll` moves the
  display offset and `snapshot()` reflects it automatically (the wheel routes
  here via `ClientMsg::ScrollAt`).

## Key seams and conventions

- **Protocol changes**: every new `FrameMsg`/`Flags`/apphost-`Frame` field
  must be `#[serde(default)]` so version skew (old daemon ↔ new client, old
  apphost ↔ new frontend) degrades gracefully. Prefer new fields on existing
  messages over new enum variants (unknown variants fail the whole parse).
  Bump `PROTO_VERSION` (apphost/proto.rs) on any apphost protocol change; if
  a change genuinely breaks older apphosts, ALSO bump `MIN_COMPAT` — that
  arms the post-update safety dialog ("restart the app server, closes your
  apps") instead of letting users' sessions break silently. Never bump
  `MIN_COMPAT` casually: it forces users through an app-closing restart.
- **New windowed widgets** follow the Store/Settings/Logs pattern:
  a `WinContent` variant + `focused_is_X()` flag + `ClientMsg::X*` variants +
  a routing branch in `client.rs`. Widgets are pure state+render; they never
