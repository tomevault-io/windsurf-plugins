# Concurrency patterns (context, cancellation, workers)

References
- @.cursor/rules/go/go_base.mdc

Guidelines
- Use context for cancellation; select on ctx.Done().
- Keep goroutines short-lived; avoid leaks.
- Use buffered channels deliberately; document buffer rationale.

Acceptance checklist
- Examples compile; vet is clean.
