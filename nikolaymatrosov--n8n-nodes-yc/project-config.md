# Commit Message Format

## Conventional Commits
All commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commits specification.

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scopes (examples for this project)
- **compute**: YandexCloudCompute node
- **containers**: YandexCloudContainers node
- **streams**: YandexCloudDataStreams node
- **functions**: YandexCloudFunctions node
- **gpt**: YandexCloudGpt/LMChatYandexGpt nodes
- **mq**: YandexCloudMessageQueue node
- **storage**: YandexCloudObjectStorage node
- **postbox**: YandexCloudPostbox node
- **speechkit**: YandexCloudSpeechKit/STT nodes
- **workflows**: YandexCloudWorkflows node
- **creds**: Credentials
- **utils**: Utility functions
- **types**: Type definitions

### Rules
1. **Type is mandatory** and must be lowercase
2. **Description is mandatory**, must be lowercase, and should not end with a period
3. Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
4. Don't capitalize the first letter of the description
5. Breaking changes must be indicated with `!` after type/scope OR in footer with `BREAKING CHANGE:`
6. Keep the first line under 72 characters
7. Body and footer are optional, separated by blank lines

### Examples

#### Simple commit
```
feat(gpt): add streaming support for chat completions
```

#### With scope and body
```
fix(storage): handle multipart upload errors correctly

The multipart upload was failing silently when chunk size exceeded
the limit. Now it properly validates and reports errors.
```

#### Breaking change
```
feat(mq)!: change message format to support metadata

BREAKING CHANGE: Messages now use a new format with separate metadata field.
Migration guide: wrap existing message content in { body: content, metadata: {} }
```

#### Multiple types in one commit (avoid this)
```
chore: update dependencies and fix linting issues
```

#### Without scope
```
docs: update README with installation instructions
```

#### Revert
```
revert: feat(gpt): add streaming support

This reverts commit a1b2c3d4. Streaming caused memory issues in production.
```

### When NOT to use Conventional Commits
- Quick WIP commits during development (use `wip: <description>` for these)
- Merge commits (generated automatically)

### Validation
Before committing, ensure your message:
- [ ] Starts with a valid type
- [ ] Has a colon and space after type (or scope)
- [ ] Has a meaningful description in imperative mood
- [ ] Stays under 72 characters for the first line
- [ ] Uses lowercase for type and description
