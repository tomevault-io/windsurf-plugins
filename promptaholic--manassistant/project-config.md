Manassist Development & Deployment Branching Guidelines
To maintain consistency and organization across all development workflows, the following rules apply unless explicitly stated otherwise:

1. Branching Strategy
Main Branch (main):

The production-ready branch.
Only stable, tested code should be merged here.
Direct commits are not allowed; only merges from develop.
Development Branch (develop):

The integration branch for staging new features.
All feature branches should be merged here before going to main.
This branch should always remain deployable.
Feature Branches (feature/*):

Each new feature or bug fix should be developed in its own branch.
Naming convention: feature/{short-description} (e.g., feature/login-system).
Must be merged into develop before deployment.
2. Deployment Environments
Local:

Developers should test new changes in their local environment before pushing.
Branches are synced to local databases before merging.
Staging:

Code from develop is deployed here for testing.
Used for integration testing, bug fixes, and approval before production.
Production (prod):

Only main branch gets deployed to production.
No direct deployments; must go through develop and staging first.
3. Merge Rules
Feature branches should be reviewed and tested before merging into develop.
No direct commits to main or develop—all changes should come from approved pull requests.
Staging should always reflect the latest stable develop state before moving to production.
This structured approach ensures a clear path from feature development to production deployment, minimizing risks and maintaining stability. 🚀
