# .clinerules Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for using `.clinerules` files to maintain project standards and improve team consistency when using Cline.

## Key Benefits of .clinerules

- **Version Controlled**: The `.clinerules` file becomes part of your project's source code, allowing for version tracking and collaboration.
- **Team Consistency**: Ensures consistent behavior of Cline across all team members working on the project.
- **Project-Specific**: Allows for rules and standards to be tailored to the specific needs of each project.
- **Institutional Knowledge**: Helps maintain project standards and development practices directly within the codebase, serving as living documentation.

## Example .clinerules Structure

A well-structured `.clinerules` file can include sections for project guidelines, documentation, architecture decisions, code style, and testing standards.

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

- Update relevant documentation in `/docs` when modifying features
- Keep `README.md` in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in `CHANGELOG.md`

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in `/docs/adr` for:

- Major dependency changes
- Architectural pattern changes
- New integration patterns
- Database schema changes
  - Follow template in `/docs/adr/template.md`

## Code Style & Patterns

- Generate API clients using OpenAPI Generator
- Use TypeScript axios template
- Place generated code in `/src/generated`
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Follow error handling pattern in `/src/utils/errors.ts`

## Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
```

## Security Best Practices

To protect sensitive information, use `.clinerules` to instruct Cline to ignore specific files or patterns. This is crucial for:

- `.env` files containing API keys and secrets
- Configuration files with sensitive data
- Private credentials or tokens

Example security section in `.clinerules`:

```markdown
# Security

## Sensitive Files

DO NOT read or modify:

- .env files
- *_/config/secrets.*
- *_/*.pem
- Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output
```

## General Use Cases

- Maintaining project standards across team members.
- Enforcing development practices within the project.
- Managing documentation requirements.
- Setting up analysis frameworks.
- Defining project-specific behaviors for Cline.

## Tips for Writing Effective .clinerules

- **Be Clear and Concise**: Use simple language and avoid ambiguity in your instructions.
- **Focus on Desired Outcomes**: Describe the results you want Cline to achieve, rather than specific steps to take.
- **Test and Iterate**: Experiment with different instructions to find what works best for your project's workflow.

By incorporating these best practices into your projects using `.clinerules`, you can ensure consistency, maintain security, and streamline development workflows with Cline.
