# KeyType — Always-On Rules

> **Source of truth: [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).** This rule is a pointer so the guardrails
> apply inside Cursor; keep substantive edits in `AGENTS.md` so the two can't drift.

KeyType is an open-source, on-device, system-wide macOS tab-autocomplete utility — a clean-room
alternative to the closed-source app *Cotypist*. It is **built and shipping**; work is maintenance
and iteration. **Read `docs/00-overview.md` first.**

The non-negotiables (full detail in `AGENTS.md`):

- **Prefer suppression to a wrong suggestion**; predict a *short* base-model continuation that
  ends exactly at the cursor; keep it on-device and private (clipboard/OCR/history opt-in).
- **Extend the existing module graph; do not rewrite it.** Cross-module types go in
  `AutocompleteCore` (no AppKit/llama deps); the app target is the only wiring layer.
- Generation is cancellable; model decode runs off the main actor; AX + overlay code is `@MainActor`.
- Make the smallest change behind the existing protocols; add/update tests and keep
  `swift build` + `swift test` green for every package you touch.
- Triage quality from `predictions.log` first; measure latency in a **release** build.
- Log non-obvious decisions as a new ADR in `docs/05-decisions.md`.
- **Only create git commits when the human explicitly asks.**
