# velocity.report Development Guidelines

> **Canonical knowledge lives in `.github/knowledge/`.** This file summarises the essentials that every Copilot interaction needs. For deeper detail, read the referenced module.

## Tenets

See [TENETS.md](../TENETS.md) for the full project constitution. The short version:

1. **Privacy above all** — no cameras, no licence plates, no PII, local-only data
2. **Protect the vulnerable** — safety for people who walk, cycle, and play
3. **Evidence over opinion** — measured data, not anecdote
4. **Local-first** — Raspberry Pi, SQLite, offline-capable
5. **Simplicity and durability** — smallest change that solves the problem
6. **DRY** — every fact has one canonical source

## Project Overview

**velocity.report** is a privacy-focused traffic monitoring system for neighbourhood change-makers.

| Component        | Language          | Location                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Server           | Go                | `cmd/`, `internal/`       |
| PDF reports      | Go + XeLaTeX      | `internal/report/`        |
| Web frontend     | Svelte/TypeScript | `web/`                    |
| macOS visualiser | Swift/Metal       | `tools/visualiser-macos/` |
| Database         | SQLite            | local file                |
| Docs site        | Eleventy          | `public_html/`            |
| PDF pipeline     | Go                | `internal/report/`        |

**Deployment:** Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM64 Linux), systemd service, local-only.

For full architecture, tech stack, data flow, and schema: see [knowledge/architecture.md](knowledge/architecture.md).

## Quality Gate (Mandatory)

Every commit must pass:

```bash
make lint      # Check all code formatting
make format    # Auto-format all code
make test      # Run all test suites
```

## Validation Protocol

| Language | Commands                                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go       | `make format-go && make lint-go && make test-go && make build-radar-local` |
| Web      | `make format-web && make lint-web && make test-web && make build-web`      |

If the Go build fails due to missing pcap on the cross-compile host: install `libpcap-dev` (Linux) or `brew install libpcap` (macOS), then use `make build-radar-linux`.

For full build setup, dev servers, and testing: see [knowledge/build-and-test.md](knowledge/build-and-test.md).

## Quick Reference

**Critical paths (hyphen, not dot):**

| Path                                      | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/var/lib/velocity-report/`               | Data directory                                               |
| `/var/lib/velocity-report/sensor_data.db` | Database                                                     |
| `/usr/local/bin/velocity-report`          | Service binary                                               |
| `.venv/`                                  | Python developer tooling only (not in production/RPi images) |

**Note:** `.venv/` is for local developer tooling and scripts. It is not included in deployed production binaries or Raspberry Pi images.

**SQLite:** `modernc.org/sqlite v1.44.3` (SQLite 3.51.2). Use `DROP COLUMN` directly in new migrations.

**Documentation:** When changing functionality, update README.md, component READMEs, ARCHITECTURE.md, and public_html/src/guides/setup.md as relevant.
