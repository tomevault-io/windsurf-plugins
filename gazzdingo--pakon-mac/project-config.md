description: Cite PakonIMAu.dll VAs on ports; FOS status table in replies
---


# Pakon cite + status table

## Cite every ported line

When adding or changing host ports of Pakon behaviour (especially under
`tools/ansel/`, `tools/pakon_*.py`, and related docs):

- Put a comment on **each** new/changed constant, store offset, and
  computation line naming **where it lives in Pakon**.
- Format: `PakonIMAu.dll @ 0x……` (base `0x10000000`). The DLL has no
  source line numbers — **VA is the cite**.
- Docstrings alone are not enough; keep the cite on the line (or the
  constant) that implements the behaviour.
- Do not invent maths; only port equations with a cited VA.

Example:

```python
F64_10000 = 10000.0  # PakonIMAu.dll @ 0x105a7258
gm_slope = ftol2_chop(F64_10000 * c1_e)  # PakonIMAu.dll @ 0x102902d1 → esi+0x12
```

## FOS status table — every task end

When working on FOS / `SbaCalcFosResults`, **end every user-facing reply
that finishes a task (or a substantial step)** with an up-to-date
**done / not done** table for FOS analyze leaves only:

opening, dmin, cov, R², orderAvg, slopes/offsets, eigen, paxel,
`orderFpo` / helper Δ, full analyze wire, host roll caller,
Preference `fpo` edge.

Do this even if the reply is short, interrupted, or only confirms a
question — if FOS work was in progress, the table closes the turn.
