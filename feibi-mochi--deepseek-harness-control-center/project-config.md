# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents (e.g. a DeepSeek Harness session) asked to install, verify, or troubleshoot **deepseek-harness-wallet** on the user's machine. Human-readable docs: [README](./README.md).

## What this is

A zero-dependency, zero-build DeepSeek Harness Web plugin: a wallet chip beside the composer showing official DeepSeek balance, per-session cost and token usage (bucketed per provider), low-balance alerts, a guarded official recharge link, and a draggable floating window / minimized dot mode. Plain JavaScript — no build step, no runtime dependencies.

## Prerequisites to check first

1. Official DeepSeek Harness runtime (`dsh` / `dsh web`), Web profile.
2. Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24` (declared in `engines`; install fails on older Node).
3. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` configured in the harness credentials seam — required only for balance lookup. Token/cost tracking works without it; balance shows an error state instead.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add deepseek-harness-wallet
```

(The npm registry is the primary channel; fall back to `github:feibi-mochi/deepseek-harness-control-center` when npm is unavailable.)

Then **restart `dsh web` and hard-refresh the page** — the client half injects on page load; without a hard refresh the chip will not appear.

**Boot failure note (pre-0.1.2)**: if the page fails with `client-modules: bundle ... loaded without registering "deepseek-harness-wallet"`, the machine has the broken 0.1.1 build (client half registered the old `dsh-wallet` loader id). Fix: `dsh plugin --profile web remove deepseek-harness-wallet`, restart, then install ≥0.1.2 from npm and hard-refresh.

## Verify after install

1. A one-line chip appears beside the composer, e.g. `余额 5.89 · 本场 0.72 · 官 18.8M | 三方 800K · ↗充`.
2. Clicking the chip opens the detail panel; the `◳ 浮动` button detaches it into a draggable floating window; `–` minimizes it to a dot; `×` returns to chip mode. Position and mode persist in localStorage.
3. Send one message in the conversation — token counters must increase.

## Update / remove

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update deepseek-harness-wallet
dsh plugin --profile web remove deepseek-harness-wallet
```

The package was renamed from `dsh-wallet` to `deepseek-harness-wallet` in 0.1.1. If a machine still has the old `dsh-wallet` package installed, remove it (`dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-wallet`) to avoid two copies registering the same UI row.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| Chip missing after install | Page not hard-refreshed, or `dsh web` not restarted after install. |
| Balance shows an error | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` missing/invalid. The key only leaves the machine as the `Authorization` header to the official `/user/balance` endpoint. |
| Third-party sessions show no balance | By design — no balance API for third-party providers; only token totals are tracked. |
| Session cost looks off | Costs are estimates from the official pricing timeline (peak/off-peak since 2026-08-17); the API-returned balance is authoritative. |
| Plugin data | `$DSH_HOME/storages/wallet.json`. "清除本会话" clears only the open conversation. |

## Platform adaptation

Keep OS/browser/desktop-wrapper differences inside `createCompatibilityAdapter()` in `lib/client.js`. Do not add Electron, Tauri, Windows, macOS, or Linux branches to wallet accounting, polling, layout, or React rendering. A wrapper may provide the optional synchronous `window.__DSH_WALLET_ADAPTER__` fields documented in README; standards-based browser fallbacks must continue to work when the adapter is absent. Add adapter-focused tests for any new wrapper capability. Never advertise `capabilities.permanentDelete` unless the host implements the matching preference and session-menu action.

Permanent deletion is a host integration, not a capability implemented by this npm plugin. For a buildable DSH source tree, start with [`integrations/dsh-session-delete/README.md`](./integrations/dsh-session-delete/README.md) and its pinned reference patch. On a different DSH commit, port the documented invariants by semantics; never force-apply the patch or fake the capability signal.

## Hard constraints — do not do these

- Never hand-edit the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` to insert this plugin — the package already declares `dsh.bundle.patch`; manual insertion duplicates the loader id and breaks loading.
- Never change or "generalize" the hardcoded recharge URL (`https://platform.deepseek.com/top_up`) — it is hardcoded on purpose as an anti-phishing measure.
- The plugin registers no model tools and injects no prompt content; keep it that way.
