# CLAUDE.md (`.claude/`)

Guidance specific to Claude Code sessions that open pull requests against this
repository (including automated/scheduled sessions). See the root `CLAUDE.md`
and `AGENTS.md` for everything else.

## Keep inline comments very brief — put the color in the PR description

Default to **no comment at all**. Write one only when it carries knowledge a
reader cannot get from the code itself plus a `git blame` pointing at the PR
that introduced it. When you do write one, keep it to a line or two.

Rationale, rejected alternatives, benchmark numbers, "we tried X and it
didn't work", links to upstream issues, and anything that reads as a history
lesson belong in the **PR description** (and, where user-facing, the
changeset) — not in the source. Those places are where a reader who has
already found the line via `git blame` will end up anyway, and they don't
have to be maintained as the code around them changes.

Concretely, do not write comments that:

- restate what the next line already says;
- explain why an alternative implementation was _not_ chosen;
- narrate the change (`// now compiled out in release builds`) — that is a
  commit message, and it goes stale the moment the code moves;
- document a well-known toolchain fact (e.g. what `NDEBUG` means) that a
  reader can look up.

Comments that _do_ earn their place: a non-obvious constraint the compiler or
platform imposes, a workaround with the exact condition that makes it
removable (see the upstream-fix guidance in `AGENTS.md`), or a subtle
invariant a future edit could silently break.

## Attach CI labels when you open a PR

`.github/workflows/check.yml`'s `pull_request` trigger only fires on
`opened`, `synchronize` and `reopened` — **not** `labeled`. Several of its
jobs are gated behind a label check evaluated against that triggering
event's payload, e.g.:

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/next' || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'Host 🏡')
```

A label added after the PR is already open does nothing on its own — there
is no new `opened`/`synchronize`/`reopened` event for the workflow to
re-evaluate against, so the gated job silently never runs, and that gap is
easy to miss since the Check run still shows green (the job wasn't
skipped-and-failed, it just never triggered).

The label name in the `if:` condition has to match a real, currently-existing
GitHub label exactly (name and emoji). `host-cpp-tests` checked for a label
literally named `host` for a while, when the repository's real label was
`Host 🏡` — the condition never matched anything anyone would actually apply,
so the job silently only ran on pushes to `main`/`next`. Confirm the label
exists (e.g. via the GitHub MCP `get_label` tool) before trusting a condition
or table like the one below.

The `create_pull_request` GitHub MCP tool has no `labels` parameter, so
labels can only be attached in a follow-up call after the PR exists — which
is exactly the case above. **Whenever you open a PR here:**

1. Decide which of the labels below apply, based on what the diff touches.
2. Attach them immediately after creating the PR (e.g. `issue_write` with
   `method: "update"`, or the equivalent `gh pr edit --add-label`).
3. Push one more commit to the branch — even a trivial or `--allow-empty`
   one — so a `synchronize` event fires and the gated jobs actually run with
   the labels now present. Labeling without this step means the relevant CI
   never runs before merge.
