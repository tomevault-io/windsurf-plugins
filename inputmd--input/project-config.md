# Cloud Development Environment

## Services

- **Backend**: `npm run server` — Node.js HTTP server on port 8787 (uses Node 22 built-in SQLite, no external DB needed).
- **Frontend**: `npm run dev` — Vite dev server on port 5173, proxies `/api` to the backend.
- Both must run simultaneously for local development. See `DEVELOPING.md` for full setup.

## Git LFS

`shared/dictionary.bloom` is tracked by Git LFS. Run `git lfs pull` after cloning to materialize it; otherwise `reader_ai_tools` tests will fail.

## Lint / typecheck / test

- `npx biome check .` — lint
- `npx tsc` — frontend typecheck
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.server.json` — server typecheck
- `npx ava` — all tests (543 pass, 1 skipped codex bridge live test)

## Notes

- The backend logs `configured=false` when GitHub OAuth env vars are empty; this is expected locally without OAuth credentials. Public repo viewing and the editor work without authentication.
- The `(node:…) ExperimentalWarning: SQLite` warning is expected on Node 22 and is harmless.
- No `.env` file is committed; copy `.env.example` to `.env` once after first clone.
