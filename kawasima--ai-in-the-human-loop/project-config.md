# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository.

## What this repository is

This is both a template for the `HUMAN.md` feedback loop and a live experiment
running that loop on itself. See [README.md](README.md) for the broader
context.

When you are working in this repository, you are doing two jobs at once:

1. Maintaining the template files so they remain useful in other repositories.
2. Updating this repository's own `HUMAN.md` based on what you observe while
   working here.

## HUMAN.md feedback loop

While working, watch for the following kinds of friction:

- The same ambiguity returning across requests
- An implementation that stalled because a human decision was missing
- Rework caused by an unclear change scope
- A review that missed something because the review criteria were not declared
- Specification intent that was not written down
- A situation where you had to make an unsafe assumption

When one of these materially affected the work, invoke the `human-feedback`
skill (see `skills/human-feedback/SKILL.md`). The skill writes a structured
entry into `HUMAN.md`.

Do not update `HUMAN.md` when:

- The confusion was a one-off and will not recur
- An existing entry already covers it and neither frequency nor impact changed
- You cannot write a concrete Prompt Pattern or Review Pattern for it

`HUMAN.md` is not a place to record human mistakes. It is a place to convert
observed friction into prompts, review checks, and decisions that improve the
next round.

## Language

Write all template files in this repository in English: `README.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `HUMAN.md`, `HUMAN.schema.md`, `skills/human-feedback/SKILL.md`,
the GitHub templates, and the Claude Code command files.

When this template is copied into another repository, the `human-feedback`
skill matches the language already used in that repository's `HUMAN.md`. If it
is creating `HUMAN.md` fresh, it follows the repository's existing
documentation language.

## Writing style

- Avoid grand metaphors. Do not write phrases like "feedback loop machinery"
  or "the central nervous system of the loop."
- Do not start paragraphs with "**Keyword**: explanation" templates. Write
  prose.
- State a conclusion once. Do not restate it at the end of every section.
- Prefer active verbs ("Observe / Record / Surface / Triage") over
  nominalized constructs ("the observation phase / the recording mechanism").
- Bold sparingly. If a paragraph contains several bold spans, the prose is
  doing too little work.

## PR workflow

This repository targets `master` directly while it is bootstrapping. Once the
template is stable, switch to a `feature/* → develop` workflow.
