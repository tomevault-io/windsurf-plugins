### 1. JavaScript Environment Limitations

The Jellyfin plugin configuration page has a specific JavaScript environment that must be respected.

- **No Template Literals:** Do not use ES6 template literals (backticks `` ` ``) for string formatting. This environment does not support them. All dynamic strings **must** be constructed using traditional string concatenation with the `+` operator.

- **Use Inline Notifications:** Jellyfin's `Dashboard.alert()` function is unreliable and fails silently. Standard browser `alert()` is also discouraged as it is intrusive. All user-facing messages (both success and error) **must** be displayed using the project's custom `showNotification(message, type)` function.

### 2. API Error Handling

When handling API errors, remember that the server returns error messages in a specific format.

- A `400 Bad Request` from the backend API will contain a **JSON-encoded string** in the response body. This is *not* a JSON object. You must call `.text()` on the `Response` object and then use `JSON.parse()` on the resulting string to get the clean error message. Forgetting to parse the JSON string will result in a message wrapped in quotes being displayed.

### 3. UI Styling and CSS

To maintain a consistent and professional appearance, all UI elements must use Jellyfin's standard CSS classes.

- Avoid using custom inline styles for layout and component styling. Instead, use Jellyfin's predefined classes like `inputContainer`, `inputLabel` `sectionTitle`, `checkboxLabel`, `fieldDescription`, `emby-button`, and `raised` to ensure the plugin's UI matches the native Jellyfin look and feel.
