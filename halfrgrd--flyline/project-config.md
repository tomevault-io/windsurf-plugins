# Flyline – Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

Flyline is a Bash plugin written in Rust that replaces readline to provide an enhanced line editing experience. It is compiled as a shared library (`libflyline.so`) and loaded into Bash with `enable -f /path/to/libflyline.so flyline`.

Key features: undo/redo, cursor animations, fuzzy history suggestions, fuzzy autocompletions, bash autocomplete integration, mouse support, syntax highlighting, and tooltips.

## Repository Layout

```
src/            Rust library source (cdylib crate)
  lib.rs        Entry point; exports C symbols consumed by Bash
  bash_symbols.rs  FFI declarations for Bash/readline symbols resolved at runtime by Bash
  bash_funcs.rs    Safe-ish wrappers around Bash/readline helpers used by Flyline
  app/          TUI application logic (ratatui-based)
  *.rs          Individual feature modules
tests/          Rust integration tests and shared test helpers
  common/       Shared Rust test support code
docker-bake.hcl  Bake file defining all build and test targets
docker/         Dockerfiles and helper scripts used by CI
  builder.Dockerfile             Multi-stage build; produces libflyline.so and runs Docker-based lib tests
  bash_integration_test.Dockerfile  Loads the .so into various Bash versions
  specific_bash_version.Dockerfile  Builds the Bash versions used by the integration-test matrix
.github/workflows/ci.yml  CI entrypoint for Docker builds and test matrix jobs
Cargo.toml      Rust manifest (edition 2024, cdylib crate type)
```

## How to Build

For a quick local (host-native) build during development:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

`src/bash_symbols.rs` declares extern Bash/readline symbols that are provided by
Bash when `libflyline.so` is loaded with `enable -f ... flyline`. Those symbols
are not available when Rust links a normal unit-test binary, so test code must
avoid pulling them in directly. The crate uses `#[cfg(test)]` shims in
`src/bash_funcs.rs` to provide hardcoded test-only behaviour (see the
`test_fixtures` module) so `cargo test --lib` links cleanly without any
Bash-owned symbols.

CI also builds the library inside Docker to target glibc 2.23 (Ubuntu 16.04), ensuring broad host compatibility:

```bash
docker buildx bake -f docker-bake.hcl extract-release-artifact
# Produces docker/build/libflyline.so
```

## How to Run Tests

**Unit/library tests**:

```bash
cargo test --lib
```

Always validate Flyline changes with `cargo test --lib`. To additionally
check that the production code paths still compile (i.e. without the
`#[cfg(test)]` shims), run `cargo build --release` as well.

**Bash integration tests** (load `libflyline.so` into real Bash builds):

Don't run these unless specified.

```bash
docker buildx bake -f docker-bake.hcl bash-integration-tests
```

Supported `DOCKER_BASH_VERSION` values: `4.4-rc1`, `4.4.18`, `5.0`, `5.1.16`, `5.2`, `5.3`.

CI runs both test suites via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Coding Conventions

- **Rust edition 2024** — use current idioms (`&raw mut`, `c"..."` literals, etc.).
- The crate is a `cdylib`; all public C symbols must be marked `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]`.
- Feature logic is split into focused single-responsibility modules under `src/`.
- Use `log::` macros (`log::trace!`, `log::debug!`, `log::info!`, `log::warn!`, `log::error!`) for all diagnostic output; never use `println!` for debug messages.
- Prefer `anyhow::Result` for fallible functions.
- Keep `unsafe` blocks as small as possible and document why each one is necessary.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without a clear justification; check the advisory database for known vulnerabilities before adding any.
- Always run `cargo fmt` before committing code.
- In Rust tests, do not add custom failure messages to `assert!` calls (e.g. avoid `assert!(x, "expected …")`). Use plain `assert!(x)` to match the existing test style in this codebase.

## Docs and examples
After you have made your changes, be sure to update all docs, readme's, examples, demo vhs tapes, dockerfiles.
The code in the vhs tapes might be spread across multiple lines so take care here.
