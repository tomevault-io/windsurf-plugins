# Agent Guidelines for Quinoa

This document is the source of truth for AI agents working on Quinoa. It is
client-neutral; optional adapter files for OpenCode or Devin may exist, but they
are not required to understand or verify the repository.

## Project Overview

Quinoa is a meeting recording and transcription application for Linux.

- **Python (PyQt6)** drives the GUI and application logic.
- **Rust (PyO3)** handles audio capture and device management in `quinoa_audio/`.
- **FFmpeg** mixes, trims, and converts audio at runtime.
- **Google Gemini** provides transcription and chat (live API; not used in
  automated tests).
- **SQLite** stores meetings, transcripts, and notes locally.
- **Keyring** stores the Gemini API key and File Search store name securely.

## Project Management (Ticket)

Use the Ticket CLI (`tk`) for task tracking.

### Core workflow

1. Start of session: `tk ready` (unblocked work) or `tk ls --status=open` (all
   open tickets).
2. Start work: `tk start <ticket-id>`.
3. Create follow-ups: `tk create "Title"`.
4. Close when done: `tk close <ticket-id>`.

### Useful commands

- `tk ls --status=open` — list open tickets
- `tk ready` — list unblocked tickets ready for work
- `tk blocked` — list blocked tickets
- `tk show <id>` — view ticket details
- `tk query` — export tickets as JSON
- `tk help` — see all commands

Preserve closed ticket history: never rewrite, delete, or alter a closed
ticket's record. If a closed ticket reveals genuinely new work, prefer a
follow-up ticket. Reopen a closed ticket only when the original ticket is
demonstrably incomplete and the product intent is confirmed.

## Code Quality Standards

Run the canonical verifier before finishing:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh
```

The script checks, in order: locked UV dependencies, Ruff format and lint,
Mypy, Python tests against a mock audio build, Rust format, Rust mock/real
checks and tests, and then restores the real PipeWire extension. It also checks
shell syntax and desktop-file validation.

### Python

- Target Python 3.12+ syntax (`str | None`, not `Optional[str]`).
- Follow Ruff's configured rules; use `uv run ruff check --fix quinoa tests` for
  safe fixes.
- Run `uv run mypy quinoa tests` after changes.
- Use the `quinoa` logger; do not use `print()` in application code (tests may
  print).

### Rust

- `quinoa_audio` builds as a `cdylib` via PyO3.
- `cargo check --locked --no-default-features --features real-audio` (PipeWire)
  and `--features mock` must pass.
- `cargo test --locked --no-default-features --features mock` and
  `--features real-audio` must link and pass.
- Maturin extension builds enable `extension-module` through `pyproject.toml`;
  normal Cargo checks/tests do not.

## File Ownership

| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| Constants | `quinoa/constants.py` |
| Logging | `quinoa/logging.py` |
| UI styles | `quinoa/ui/styles.py` |
| Database | `quinoa/storage/database.py` |
| Audio utilities (FFmpeg) | `quinoa/audio/` |
| Transcription | `quinoa/transcription/` |
| Calendar integration | `quinoa/calendar/` |
| File Search | `quinoa/search/` |
| UI components | `quinoa/ui/` |
| Rust audio library | `quinoa_audio/` |
| Automated Python tests | `tests/python/` |

See `README.md` for the current source tree and `ROADMAP.md` for milestones.

## Key Files

1. `quinoa/ui/main_window.py` — main window, worker orchestration, pending-worker
   cleanup.
2. `quinoa/ui/middle_panel.py` — recording controls, notes/transcript viewer.
3. `quinoa/ui/calendar_panel.py` — left panel meeting list.
4. `quinoa/storage/database.py` — SQLite operations and migrations.
5. `quinoa/config.py` — configuration; keyring-backed secrets.
6. `quinoa/transcription/manager.py` — transcription job queue and cooperative
   cancellation.
7. `quinoa_audio/src/capture/session.rs` — Rust recording session, device
   switching.

## Common Tasks

### Add a constant

1. Add to `quinoa/constants.py`.
2. Import and use where needed.
3. Run `uv run ruff check quinoa tests` and `uv run mypy quinoa tests`.

### Modify the database schema

1. Update `_init_db()` in `quinoa/storage/database.py`.
2. Add defensive migration logic for existing databases (check column/table
   before adding).
3. Add type hints and update relevant queries.
4. Run `tests/python/test_database.py`.

### Work with audio

- Mock build (no PipeWire):
  `cd quinoa_audio && uv run maturin develop --no-default-features --features extension-module,mock`
- Real build: `uv run maturin develop` from the project root.
- `quinoa/audio/mixer.py` and `quinoa/audio/trimmer.py` use FFmpeg at runtime;
  `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` must be in `PATH`.

## Testing

### Automated suite

```bash
uv run pytest tests/python
```

The canonical `./scripts/check.sh` runs this plus Rust and format gates.

### Smoke test warning

```bash
uv run python -m quinoa.main --test
```

This starts a short recording, writes to the normal output directory
(`~/Music/Quinoa/`), and mutates the production database. Run it only when you
intend to create recording state. It is excluded from CI and
`./scripts/check.sh`.

### Manual checks (run only with permission)

- Recording start/stop, pause/resume.
- Microphone switching during recording.
- Device hot-plug detection.
- Transcription and history display.
