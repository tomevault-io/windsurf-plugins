- Add "task_reading applied" at the beginning of the chat message.

## Required files and folders
  - .status/tasks: Current development tasks and requirements, source of tasks definitions
  - [status.md](mdc:.status/status.md) : Project progress and state
  
## TDD-focused Workflow Steps
  1. Read task requirements, divide the task by "steps", extract acceptance criteria and identify dependencies.
  2. Update [status.md](mdc:.status/status.md) to mark the corresponding task as "In progress". If the task is not mentioned in [status.md](mdc:.status/status.md), add it.
  3. Always begin with steps defining the domain layer, using [domain_layer.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project/domain_layer.mdc) rules. Give an empty implementation for repository methods. 
  4. Then, handle steps for the data layer, using [data_layer.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project/data_layer.mdc) rules.
  5. At last, handle steps for the UI layer, using [ui_layer.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project/ui_layer.mdc) rules.

## Validation Checklist Before Marking Task Complete
- [ ] All repositories, use cases and state notifiers have corresponding test files
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] Tests cover all acceptance criteria from requirements
- [ ] Tests include edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Code follows project architecture and style guidelines
- [ ] TDD approach was followed: tests written before implementation
