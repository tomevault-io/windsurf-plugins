# Cursor AI Rules for x402-exec

## CRITICAL: Git Workflow (READ FIRST)

Before making ANY code changes or commits, you MUST:
1. **Read `.github/WORKFLOW.md`** for complete Git workflow rules
2. **Check current branch**: `git branch --show-current`
3. **Follow branch rules**:
   - On `main`? → Create new branch first
   - On feature branch? → Can commit, but DON'T push without approval
4. **Never push without explicit user approval**

## Code Standards

- Use TypeScript for all JavaScript code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write clear commit messages (conventional commits format)
- Add tests for new features when applicable

## Documentation

- Update relevant docs when changing features
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document complex logic with comments

## Reference Documents

- **Git Workflow**: `.github/WORKFLOW.md` (detailed rules and examples)
- **Contributing**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Development**: `docs/development.md`
