# Project
We use a golang backend

## tech stack
Svelte5, global .css files, local scoped svelte css, event handlers used

Sveltekit Adaper Static -> SPA system for Sveltekit

This project uses Svelte 5 which is a new updated versison which has some differnet rules

### $state
let var = $state(val)
-Are reactive
-to be safely exported/used externally they must be wrapped by a POJO either inisde or outisde the state 

### $derived
let var = $derived(val+1)
let var2 = $derived.by(()=>return(val+1))

we can use either derived or derived.by for derives. They automatically update based on the states

### $effect

$effect(()=>{
    myState
    console.log("My state changed)
})

$effect(()=>{
    myState
    untrack(()=>{
        console.log("this state changed here is myState and my other state:", myState, myOtherState)
    })
})


This automatically runs based on the state variables inside of it changing.
Untrack can be used to store variables we don't want to trigger the effect.

EFFECT SHOULD BE USED RARELY, using a function or an event listenr is usually better. 


### props in svelte5

<MyComponent prop1="val", prop2={false}/>


<script>
    let{prop1, prop2, children}=$props()
</script>

<div>
    <div>{prop1}</div>
    <div>{prop2}</div>
    {@render children()}
</div>

This is the svelte 5 way to use props. We can also render the children of a compoennt this way too. WE NO THIS IS THE NEW WAY TO RENDER CHILDREN.

### event handlers
<button onclick={eventHandler}>clickme</button>
<button onclick={()=>eventHandler()}>clickme</button>

<div onhover{(e)=>eventHandler(e)}>hoverme</div>

etc...

The Svelete 5 event handlers are written like
onhover, onclick, onscroll

### $lib
$lib is an alias for PROJECTROOT/src/lib
This is where we store items we want to share easily across the app

### internal design patterns
We use classes to initialize and persist data across sessions. These classes are stored in $lib/classes/class.svelte.js

we export individual class isntances from each class file export {myInstance}

hese usually have initializer functions which are async functions which return a promise (we persist the promise after first initialization so we can always check if we are intiialized WITHOUT reinitializing)

await myClassInstance.intialize()

... now we use the class
or 
<await myClassInstance.intialize() :then>
	{myClassInstance.expectedDataObject?.thing}
</await>
