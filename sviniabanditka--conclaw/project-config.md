# ConClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process with channel system. Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail) self-register at startup. Messages route to Claude Agent SDK running in containers (Linux VMs). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/registry.ts` | Channel registry (self-registration at startup) |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent containers with mounts |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |
| `container/skills/` | Skills loaded inside agent containers (browser, status, formatting) |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions (skill-as-branch system) |

## Skills

Four types of skills exist in ConClaw:

- **Feature skills** — merge a `skill/*` branch to add capabilities (e.g. `/add-telegram`, `/add-compact`)
- **Utility skills** — ship code files alongside SKILL.md (e.g. `/claw`)
- **Operational skills** — instruction-only workflows on `main` (e.g. `/setup`, `/debug`)
- **Container skills** — loaded inside agent containers at runtime (`container/skills/`)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update-conclaw` | Bring upstream updates into a customized install |
| `/update-skills` | Update installed skill branches from upstream |
| `/init-onecli` | Install OneCLI Agent Vault and migrate `.env` credentials to it |
| `/add-caveman` | Enable compressed communication style (lite/full/ultra/off) |

## Secrets / Credentials / Proxy (OneCLI)

API keys, secret keys, OAuth tokens, and auth credentials are managed by the OneCLI gateway — which handles secret injection into containers at request time, so no keys or tokens are ever passed to containers directly. Run `onecli --help`.

## Development

Run commands directly — don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.conclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.conclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.conclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start conclaw
systemctl --user stop conclaw
systemctl --user restart conclaw
```

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.
