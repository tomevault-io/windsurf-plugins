# OpenCode-Plugin Project Rules

## About

This repo is a JetBrains IDE plugin that integrates the OpenCode AI coding assistant into IntelliJ-based IDEs. It
provides a tool window, settings panel, and lifecycle management for launching and interacting with the OpenCode CLI
from within the IDE.

## Prefer JetBrains Tools

Always prefer `jetbrains_*` tools over generic alternatives when both are available:

- Use `jetbrains_*` tools for all file reads. Do not use `Read`, or shell-based file reading.
- You may use the standard `Write`/`apply_patch` tool instead of the `jetbrains_replace_text_in_file` tool
