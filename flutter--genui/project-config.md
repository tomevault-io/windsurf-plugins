# `genui_a2a` Package Context for AI Agents

## Purpose

This document provides context for AI agents making changes to the `genui_a2a` package. This package acts as the bridge between the `genui` UI framework and any server implementing the [A2UI Streaming UI Protocol](https://a2ui.org).

## Key Concepts & Responsibilities

-   **Content Generator Integration:** `genui_a2a` provides the `A2uiAgentConnector` which is designed to be used with `genui`'s `SurfaceController`.
-   **A2A Communication:** All direct communication with the A2A server happens within this package, mainly in `A2uiAgentConnector` using the `package:a2a` client library.
-   **A2UI Message Parsing:** This package is responsible for taking the raw data from the A2A server and converting it into the structured `A2uiMessage` objects defined in `genui`.
-   **UI Event Submission:** It also handles sending UI interaction events from `genui` back to the A2A server.

## Core Classes to Understand

1.  **`A2uiAgentConnector`** (`lib/src/a2ui_agent_connector.dart`):
    -   Handles all WebSocket and JSON-RPC communication with the A2A server using `A2AClient`.
    -   Manages connection state, task ID, and context ID.
    -   `connectAndSend()`: Key method to send a `ChatMessage` and process the streamed response. This involves parsing `A2ADataPart` for A2UI messages.
    -   `sendEvent()`: Sends user interaction data back to the server.
    -   `_processA2uiMessages()`: Crucial for converting raw JSON data into `genui.A2uiMessage` objects.

2.  **`AgentCard`** (`lib/src/a2ui_agent_connector.dart`):
    -   Simple data class for agent metadata.

## Typical Modification Areas

-   **Protocol Changes:** Updates to how A2UI messages are parsed or how A2A messages are constructed in `A2uiAgentConnector`.
-   **Error Handling:** Improvements to error detection and reporting in either class.
-   **Connection Management:** Changes to how the WebSocket connection is handled in `A2uiAgentConnector`.
-   **Stream Management:** Modifications to the StreamControllers in `A2uiAgentConnector`.

## Testing

-   `test/a2ui_agent_connector_test.dart` contains unit tests, primarily mocking the `A2AClient` to test the `A2uiAgentConnector` logic in isolation.

## Dependencies

-   `genui`: Core UI framework.
-   `a2a`: A2A client library.
-   `logging`: For logging.
-   `uuid`: For message IDs.

## Development

- While you could run the `tool/run_all_tests_and_fixes.sh` (or `tool/test_and_fix/bin/test_and_fix.dart`, which is the same thing) each time you want to test a change, it is very inefficient.
  - Instead, run the tests for the specific package you are working on. For example, `flutter test packages/genui_a2a/test`.
  - When all the tests in the package pass, and you are about to commit the code, run the tool/run_all_tests_and_fixes.sh script to fix any linting and formatting issues, and to verify that all the tests have been run.
