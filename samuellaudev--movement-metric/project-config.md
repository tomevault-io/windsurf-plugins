## Architecture

This is a **Next.js 16 App Router** project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4.

- **Routing**: File-based via `/app` directory (App Router, not Pages Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 via PostCSS; global styles and CSS theme variables in `app/globals.css`
- **Fonts**: Geist Sans/Mono loaded via `next/font` in `app/layout.tsx`
- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to the project root

**Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5 (strict mode), Tailwind CSS 4, ESLint 9
