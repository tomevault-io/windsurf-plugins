# AGENTS.md — Guidance for AI Coding Agents

This file orients AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Codex,
Continue, Windsurf, Cline, etc.) working on this repository, and it is the
only conventions document the project keeps. Equip is maintained by one
person; there is no contribution process, review rotation, or triage queue
behind the rules below — they exist because the codebase is easier to hold
in one head when they hold.

If these rules conflict with explicit instructions from the user, the user
wins — but flag the conflict in your reply so the user knows there is one.

## What this project is

**Equip** is an open-source learning management system for Bible schools,
church ministries, and nonprofit educational programs. Live instance at
https://equipbible.com. MIT-licensed. Stack:

- **Frontend** — React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, shadcn/ui + Radix, Tailwind, TipTap rich text. Lives in `frontend/`.
- **Backend** — FastAPI on Python 3.12, SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM, Pydantic 2 schemas. Lives in `backend/`.
- **Database / auth / storage** — Supabase (managed Postgres + Auth + Storage). Schema source of truth is `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Hosting** — Vercel. Frontend at `equipbible.com`, backend at `api.equipbible.com`. Production deploys from `main`; PRs get preview deploys.

The platform serves **four languages — ru, en, de, uk** — in the interface
and in teacher-authored content alike; the design language targets
Russian-speaking Bible schools first. Code, comments, commits, and docs are
written in English.

## Source of truth — read these before non-trivial changes

- [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) — design tokens, banned patterns, the four-check rule for adding a library.
- [`docs/COMPONENTS.md`](docs/COMPONENTS.md) — pattern library (`<Badge>`, `<StatCard>`, `<EmptyState>`, `<ErrorState>`, `<InlineEdit>`, `<PageHeader>`, `<Modal>`) — always reach for these before writing a custom equivalent.
- [`docs/I18N.md`](docs/I18N.md) — locale bundles, plural categories, parity guard, DB-enum localization recipe.
- [`docs/UI-DECISIONS.md`](docs/UI-DECISIONS.md) — frozen UI decisions; do not re-litigate without sign-off from a maintainer.
- [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr) — Architecture Decision Records for cross-module choices.
- [`supabase/migrations/README.md`](supabase/migrations/README.md) — append-only migration workflow.

## Hard rules — do not violate

These are load-bearing for the project.

- **No raw Tailwind palette classes.** No `bg-blue-500`, `text-gray-700`, `border-red-300`. Use the semantic tokens from `docs/DESIGN.md` (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-input`, etc.).
- **No `window.alert / prompt / confirm`.** Confirmations go through `useConfirm()` + Radix `AlertDialog`. Toasts go through `sonner`.
- **Icons:** `lucide-react` only. Sizes are `16`, `20`, or `24`. `strokeWidth={1.75}` on every icon.
- **All user-facing strings go through `t(...)`.** Locale bundles live in `frontend/src/i18n/locales/{ru,en,de,uk}.json` and must stay in parity. CI fails on drift.
- **Conventional Commits.** `feat(quiz): ...`, `fix(auth): ...`, `chore(ci): ...`. Branch name mirrors the commit prefix (`feat/quiz-extra-attempts`, `fix/audit-invalid-uuid`).
- **Migrations are append-only.** Never edit an `.sql` file under `supabase/migrations/` that has already been applied. Create a new timestamped file (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_<slug>.sql`) instead.
- **The four-way enum mirror.** A new persisted enum value must be added in **four** places that stay in lockstep: Postgres `CHECK` constraint, the Python side (a Pydantic `Literal[...]`, or the `StrEnum` in `backend/app/models/` -- roles use `UserRole`), TypeScript union type, and the TypeScript `const` accessor (e.g. `ROLES`). See `frontend/src/types/index.ts` for the pattern.
- **No Docker.** The project deliberately avoids container workflows today. Do not suggest one.
- **Branch and commit names mirror each other**, and both use the Conventional Commits prefix: `feat/quiz-extra-attempts` carries `feat(quiz): …`. Work never lands directly on `main`.

## Pre-PR verification

Run locally before pushing — CI is zero-warnings on all of these:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy --config-file mypy.ini
python -m pytest tests/

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint        # eslint --max-warnings 0
npx tsc --noEmit    # strict
npm run i18n:check  # locale parity
npm run test:run    # vitest
npm run build       # locale boot script, tsc, vite build, bundle-size budget, sourcemaps
```

## Commit conventions — including AI co-authorship

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
**If you are an AI agent committing on behalf of the maintainer, add a
`Co-Authored-By:` trailer crediting yourself** so the history reflects how
the change was actually made:

```
feat(quiz): allow teacher-gifted extra attempts

A student who runs out of attempts can be granted more without
resetting the whole `attempts_used` counter. Implemented as a new
`quiz_extra_attempts` row keyed on (quiz_id, user_id).

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
