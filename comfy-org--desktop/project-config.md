# Playwright End-to-End Testing

- This project uses `Playwright` for end-to-end testing
- Tests are stored in subdirectories of `tests/integration/`
- Directory structure of `tests/integration/` is based on the test phase the tests
- Tests should use the convenience methods and properties defined in the helper classes
  - Prefer adding properties to test classes over using locator selectors directly in tests
  - Test classes are stored in the `tests/integrations` directory
- Tests should be cross-platform compatible; able to run on Windows, macOS, and linux
  - e.g. the use of `path.join` and `path.sep` to ensure tests work the same on all platforms

## Test phases (Playwright projects)

1. `install`: The install phase resets the entire test environment after each test.
2. `post-install-setup`: Installs the app with default settings, creating a baseline for each test in the next phase (`post-install`)
3. `post-install`: Tests post-install features of the desktop app, with each test starting from the state set in `post-install-setup`

## Spec files: \*.spec.ts

- Prefer imports from [testExtensions.ts](mdc:tests/integration/testExtensions.ts) over playwright defaults.

## Snapshots

- Update E2E snapshots with `yarn test:e2e:update`

## Test helper classes: tests/integration/test\*.ts

- These files contain clean methods and properties for use in spec files
- Use of these classes is preferred whenever possible, as they make the code easier to read
