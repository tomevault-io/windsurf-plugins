## Modern TypeScript Standards

These rules define how we write modern, strict, and highly readable TypeScript across this repository.

### Language level and project defaults

- **TypeScript version**: Use features available in TypeScript 5.x.
- **Module system**: **ESM only** (`type: module`). Avoid CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`).
- **Target**: ESNext runtime APIs and syntax. Prefer top‑level `await` only when it improves clarity.
- **Strictness**: `strict` and `noImplicitAny` are enabled. Code must compile with zero implicit `any`.
- **Libraries**: `skipLibCheck` is enabled for speed; do not rely on it to mask type issues in our code.

### Types, interfaces, and aliases

- **Prefer precise types**: Use `unknown` instead of `any`. Narrow with type guards. `any` is allowed only when interfacing with untyped code and must be localized and justified.
- **Interfaces vs type aliases**:
  - Use **`interface`** for public object shapes intended for extension/implementation.
  - Use **`type`** for unions, mapped/conditional types, function types, and when composition is needed.
- **Discriminated unions**: Model domain variants with a discriminant field (e.g., `kind: 'X' | 'Y'`). Use exhaustive `switch`es.
- **Constants and enums**: Prefer `as const` objects and string/number literal unions over `enum`.
- **Immutability**: Prefer `readonly` properties and `ReadonlyArray<T>` where appropriate. Do not mutate function parameters.
- **Array and record syntax**: Prefer `T[]` over `Array<T>` for readability. Prefer `Record<Key, T>` for simple maps; use `Map`/`Set` when iteration semantics or key types require it.
- **Narrowing**: Avoid non‑null assertions (`!`). Use optional chaining, nullish coalescing, and explicit guards.
- **Satisfies**: Use `satisfies` to enforce object literal conformance without widening values.

### Functions, modules, and exports

- **Named exports**: Prefer named exports. Default exports are allowed only when a module clearly has a single primary export.
- **Type‑only imports**: Use `import type { X } from '…'` for types. Keep value and type imports separated when helpful for clarity and bundling.
- **Explicit public types**: Exported functions, classes, and public APIs must have explicit parameter and return types. Internal locals can rely on inference.
- **Arrow functions**: Prefer arrow functions for local functions and callbacks. Use function declarations when hoisting or `this` binding is required.
- **No side‑effect modules**: Modules should be pure. Avoid executing logic at import time unless necessary (e.g., polyfills).

### Async code and Promises

- **Prefer async/await** over raw `then`/`catch` chains. Keep linear flow and use `try/catch` for failures.
- **No floating promises**: Either `await` promises or deliberately mark them with `void` and a comment explaining the fire‑and‑forget behavior.
- **Return types**: Functions returning async results should return `Promise<T>` (not `Promise<any>`). Use `Promise<void>` only when there is nothing meaningful to return.

### Errors and control flow

- **Throw `Error` (or subclasses)** with actionable messages. Avoid throwing strings.
- **Type‑safe handling**: Treat caught errors as `unknown` and narrow with `instanceof Error` (or custom guards) before access.
- **Exhaustiveness**: Use exhaustive `switch` statements over unions and assert on the `never` case (e.g., via an `assertUnreachable` helper).

### Collections and data modeling

- **Prefer domain types**: Centralize reusable domain types in `src/**` where discoverable. Avoid ad‑hoc inline types for shared structures.
- **Prefer `Map`/`Set`** when key presence and iteration order matter. Use `Record` for simple string/number keyed collections.

### Nullability and optionality

- **Prefer `undefined`** for absence. Avoid `null` unless interoperating with external APIs that require it.
- **Optional fields**: Use optional properties (`foo?: T`) judiciously; narrow before use.

### Readability and structure

- **Small modules**: Keep files focused and cohesive. Extract helpers when a module exceeds a clear single responsibility.
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, intention‑revealing names. Avoid abbreviations. Classes/types use `PascalCase`; variables/functions use `camelCase`.
- **Comments**: Document exported APIs with concise JSDoc. Explain “why”, not “what”. Prefer `@param` and `@return` (omit `@return` for `void`), and use `{@link}` to reference symbols. Avoid stale comments and TODOs—prefer immediate implementation.

### Interop and boundaries

- **Runtime validation at boundaries**: Validate untrusted inputs at process, network, or file boundaries. Keep types honest across IO.
- **Serialization**: Define stable shapes for data persisted or sent across IPC. Prefer explicit schemas/types.

### Linting alignment (enforced or advisory)

- **Readonly preference**: `@typescript-eslint/prefer-readonly` is enabled—prefer immutable data.
- **Template expressions**: Be mindful of `restrict-template-expressions` (relaxed in this repo). Convert values to strings explicitly when ambiguous.
- **Tests**: Test code may relax some strictness to maximize ergonomics (unsafe rules are off under `tests/**/*`). Keep type escapes localized.
