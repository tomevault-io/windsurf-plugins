# Frontend Cursor Rules - Contractor Management System

## Project Context
Next.js 14+ contractor management application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

DONOT MAKE UNCESSARY README, unless asked specifically
## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form
- Cloudinary for file uploads

## Code Style & Preferences

### UI/UX
- Clean, professional UI with minimal color
- Pure black backgrounds (bg-black) instead of dark blue or near-black
- Update styling via Tailwind CSS file rather than editing individual components
- Mobile-first responsive design

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript
- Import types from `@/lib/types`
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper type annotations for all functions
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary

### Components
- Use "use client" for client components
- Server components by default for pages
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

### API Integration
- All API calls through `@/lib/api` layer
- Use async/await, no .then() chains
- Proper error handling with try/catch
- Loading states for all async operations
- Type-safe API responses

### File Structure
```
app/              # Next.js app router pages
components/       # Reusable UI components
lib/
  ├── api.ts     # API client layer
  ├── types.ts   # TypeScript types (matches backend)
  └── utils.ts   # Utility functions
hooks/            # Custom React hooks
public/           # Static assets
styles/           # Global styles
```

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.tsx)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useAuth.ts)
- Utilities: camelCase (formatDate.ts)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Files: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for components

### State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Lift state up only when necessary
- Use URL state for shareable UI state

### Forms
- Use React Hook Form for complex forms
- shadcn/ui form components
- Client-side validation before API calls
- Proper error messages

### Best Practices
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Backend Integration
- Backend API runs on http://localhost:4000
- Use NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL from .env.local
- All API endpoints prefixed with /api
- JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- CORS enabled for localhost:3000

## Don't Do
- Don't use inline styles
- Don't create multiple README files
- Don't use gradients in UI
- Don't use near-black colors (use pure black)
- Don't bypass the API layer for fetch calls
- Don't commit sensitive env variables
