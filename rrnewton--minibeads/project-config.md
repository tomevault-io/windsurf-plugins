Let's use debug mode `cargo build` for all testing and iterative development (not `--release`).


Coding conventions
========================================

PREFER STRONG TYPES. Do not use "u32" or "String" where you can have a more specific type or at least a type alias. "String" makes it very unclear which values are legal. We want explicit Enums to lock down the possibilities for our state, and we want separate types for numerical IDs and distinct, non-overlapping uses of basic integers.

Delete trailing spaces. Don't leave empty lines that consist only of whitespace. (Double newline is fine.)

Add README.md files for every major subdirectory/subsystem.  For example `src/core`, `src/game`, etc.

Read the PROJECT_VISION description of coding conventions we should follow for high-performance Rust (unboxing, minimizing allocation, etc). In particular, adhere to the below programming patterns / avoid anti-patterns, which generally fall under the principle of "zero copy":

- Avoid clone: instead take a temporary reference to the object and manage lifetimes appropriately.
- Avoid collect: instead take an iterator with references to the original collection without copying.

Read OPTIMIZATION.md for more details.

SAFETY! This is a safe-rust project. We will not introduce the `unsafe` keyword unless we have a VERY good reason and with significant advanced planning.

Documentation and Analysis
========================================

When creating analysis documents, specifications, or other AI-generated documentation, place them in the `ai_docs/` directory. This keeps the top-level clean and makes it clear which documents are AI-generated analysis (and may become outdated) versus core project documentation.

Workflow: Task tracking
========================================

We use "beads" to track our issues locally under version control. Review `bd quickstart` to learn how to use it. 

Every time we do a git commit, update our beads issues to reflect:
- What was just completed (check off items in lists, close completed task(s))
- What's next (update the in tracking issues that track the granular issues)
- Mention in the commit any new issues created to document bugs found or future work.

The beads database is our primary tracking mechanism, so if we lose conversation history we can start again from there.  You should periodically do documentation work, usually before committing, to make sure information in the issues is up-to-date.

### Beads CONVENTIONS for this project

Do NOT read or modify files inside the `./.beads/` private database, except when fixing merge conflicts in markdown files that you can read.

Prefer the MCP client to the CLI tool. ALWAYS `bd update` existing issues, never introduce duplicates with spurious `bd create`.

The issue prefix may be customized (`foobar-1`, `foobar-2`), but for this project we use the prefix "minibeads" (e.g., `minibeads-1`, `minibeads-2`)

#### Tracking issues and Priorities

Warning: Be careful to EDIT tracking issues (`bd update`) and not just
file a new duplicate issue with `bd create`.

- Issues labeled "human" are created by me and will always have 0 priority.
- Issue minibeads-1, at priority 0, is the OVERALL tracking issue. It primarily references other tracking issues
  and reiterates some of these conventions. We want to keep it pretty short.

- The next tracking issues, e.g. minibeads-2 and on have priority 1 and are topic-specific trackers:
  - Documentation tracking (minibeads-2)
  - Testing and validation tracking (minibeads-3)
  - Performance optimization tracking (minibeads-4)
  - Feature completeness tracking vs upstream bd (minibeads-15)

 - All tracking issues refer to granular issues by name in their text, e.g. "minibeads-42"
 - All other granular issues will have priority 3 to 4 unless they are seen as a critical bug, which will bump them to priority 2.

#### Mark transient information

We often record transient information, like benchmark results, that quickly gets out of date. We want to label such information so we can tell how old it is. In addition to YYYY-MM-DD, our convention is to use:
  `git rev-list --count HEAD`
which prints out the number of commits in the repo (or equivalently the ./gitdepth.sh script), and then format the timestamp as `YYYY-MM-DD_#DEPTH(387498cecf)` e.g. `2025-10-22_#161(387498cecf)`. That's our full timestamp
for any transient information that derives from a specific commit.
Sometimes this requires us to split our commits into (1) functionality and then (2) documentation-update.

#### Reference issues in code TODO

We don't want TODO items to be in floating code alone. For anything but the most trivial TODOs, we adopt the convention of referencing issues that tracks the TODO:

```
// TODO(minibeads-13): brief summary here
```

Then, the commit that fixes the issue both removes the comment and closes the issue in beads.

#### Use description field only, not notes

When creating or updating issues with `bd`, always put ALL content in the description field. Do NOT use the --notes field, as it creates duplication and confusion between what's in description vs notes. Keep all issue information consolidated in the description field only.
