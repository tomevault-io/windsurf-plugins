# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Comments

Comment the code, not the investigation. A comment earns its place by explaining something
the reader cannot get from the code — why a non-obvious choice is the way it is, or what
breaks if it changes. Keep it to a line or two.

Leave out the evidence that led to the change. No measured statistics, no counts from a
particular run, no dates, no "verified on ...", no before/after numbers. They read as
authoritative but go stale the moment anything shifts, and they cost the reader more than
they give. If a number is genuinely load-bearing — a timeout, a threshold — state the
number and the reason for it, not the experiment that produced it.

That history does belong somewhere, just not in the source: put it in the commit message
and the PR description, where it is timestamped and stays attached to the change.

Prefer restating a mechanism concisely over narrating how it was discovered. "An empty
bot-blocked response arrives without `hasMore`, so defaulting it to False ends the walk
early" is useful. Appending how many handles that affected on a given day is not.

## Project Overview

PyTok is a TikTok web scraping library using a dual-approach architecture:
- **Primary**: Signed requests to TikTok's web API, issued from the browser session (`tiktok_api.py`)
- **Fallback**: Automatically falls back to browser automation (zendriver) when API fails

All operations are async/await based.

## Commands

```bash
# Install
pip install git+https://github.com/MEOMcGill/pytok.git@master

# Run scripts (using a conda environment)
conda run -n <env> python <script>

# Install the test and lint tooling
pip install -e '.[test,lint]'

# Run tests. Live tests are marked `live` and deselected by default, so this
# runs only the offline ones.
conda run -n <env> pytest tests/

# Run a single test. A live test needs `-m live` even when named directly,
# otherwise the default deselection drops it and nothing runs.
conda run -n <env> pytest tests/test_user.py::test_user_videos -m live

# Run the live tests (real browser + a logged-in pool account)
conda run -n <env> pytest tests/ -m live

# Lint
ruff check pytok/ tests/ examples/
```

## Architecture

```
PyTok (tiktok.py)
├── zendriver browser - CDP network response tracking
├── ZendriverTikTokApi client - API requests with msToken from browser cookies
└── Request cache - stores recent API responses

API Classes (api/*.py) - all inherit from Base
├── User - user info, videos
├── Video - metadata, bytes, comments, related videos
├── Hashtag - hashtag info and videos
├── Sound - sound info and videos by music ID
├── Search, Trending (partial implementations)
```

### Key Design Pattern: API-First with Fallback

Every data-fetching method follows this pattern:
```python
try:
    response = await self.parent.tiktok_api.make_request(...)
except ApiFailedException:
    # Fallback to browser scraping
```

### CDP Network Tracking

PyTok tracks network responses via Chrome DevTools Protocol:
- Captures responses matching `/api/`, `video/tos`, `v16-webapp`, `v19-webapp` URL patterns
- Stores response bodies before Chrome garbage collects them
- Used to extract video bytes and API data from page loads

### Captcha Handling

- Automatic solving via OpenCV image matching (`captcha_solver.py`)
- Supports slide and whirl puzzle types
- Manual solving available with `manual_captcha_solves=True`

## Key Files

- `tiktok.py` - Main entry point, manages browser and API client
- `api/base.py` - Base class with DOM interaction, captcha detection, scrolling
- `api/user.py` - User data and video fetching
- `api/video.py` - Video metadata, bytes download, comments
- `helpers.py` - HTML parsing, extracts `__UNIVERSAL_DATA_FOR_REHYDRATION__` JSON from pages
- `utils.py` - DataFrame conversion helpers (`get_video_df`, `get_comment_df`, `get_user_df`)

## PyTok Constructor Options

```python
PyTok(
    logging_level=logging.WARNING,
    request_delay=0,           # seconds between requests
    headless=False,            # headless doesn't work reliably
    manual_captcha_solves=False,
    log_captcha_solves=False,  # save captcha data to JSON files
)
```

## Usage Pattern

Always scrape as a logged-in account from the accounts pool (`pytok/accounts/`).
Anonymous sessions mostly get empty responses from TikTok now, so every example,
test and manual check should acquire an account with `PyTok.from_pool`:

```python
from pytok.accounts import AccountsPool

pool = AccountsPool()                       # ~/.pytok/accounts.db
async with await PyTok.from_pool(pool) as api:   # or username="you@email.com"
    user = api.user(username="therock")
    user_data = await user.info()

    async for video in user.videos(count=100):
        video_data = video.info()
        video_bytes = await video.bytes()
```

Accounts are registered and logged in once via
`python -m pytok.accounts.cli add|login`; `cli release <username>` recovers an
account left `in_use` by a crashed run. `WorkerPool` runs one session per account
concurrently.
