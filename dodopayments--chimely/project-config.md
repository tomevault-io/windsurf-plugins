# Chimely

Open-source, self-hostable in-app notification inbox infrastructure: one Rust
binary + Postgres (source of truth) + Redis (real-time plane), a small HTTP
API, and a drop-in `<Inbox />`.

## Repo layout

```
server/            Rust binary (single crate): API, SSE, workers
packages/client/   @chimely/client — headless TS core
packages/react/    @chimely/react  — hooks + <Inbox />
docs/              Fumadocs site
```

## Non-negotiable invariants

Violating any of these is a bug even if all tests pass.

**The two-source inbox.** The inbox is a merge of two sources: direct
notifications (fan-out on write, one row per recipient) and broadcasts
(fan-out on read, one row per announcement, never materialized per
subscriber). The list, the unread count, and read state must agree across
both sources at all times — if a change touches one surface, prove the other
two still agree. A subscriber sees a broadcast iff `broadcast.created_at >=
subscriber.created_at` (`subscribers.created_at` is backdatable on import, so
the customer decides which historical broadcasts a migrated user sees).

**Mark-all-read is a watermark upsert.** Moving the per-subscriber
`read_watermark` is the ONLY implementation — never a bulk `UPDATE` over
notification rows (MVCC bloat on the hottest write path). Read state =
per-item exception OR at-or-below the watermark, for both sources.

**Ordering timestamps come from Postgres.** `created_at`, `visible_at`, and
every watermark move are computed inside the SQL statement
(`now()`/`clock_timestamp()`), never by an app replica. The unread-counter
increment is guarded against the mark-all-read race — the `+1` is conditioned
on `visible_at > read_watermark` and read under the per-subscriber counters
lock, so a concurrent watermark move can never be clobbered.

**Transactional outbox.** The outbox/job row is inserted in the SAME Postgres
transaction as the notification row. No dual-writes between Postgres and
Redis, ever.

**Redis is the hint/cache plane.** Redis loss may DELAY hints; it must never
LOSE data. Postgres is always authoritative — counters cached in Redis are
recomputable from Postgres at any moment.

**SSE is a hint, not a transport.** Clients refetch via REST (conditional,
ETag) on every hint and reconnect. Never treat an SSE event as delivery;
missed hints must be harmless by construction.

**Jobs are deleted on completion** — never status-flagged in place. Jobs
carry a `progress_cursor`, and large fan-outs run as resumable chunked jobs:
never one giant transaction, never N tiny rows.

**Claim queries are fair.** Worker claims round-robin across environments
with pending work (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` per env) — one environment's
burst must not starve another's real-time jobs.

**environment_id is part of every key** — every PK, UNIQUE constraint, and
FK. Preferences carry a `channel` column (`'in_app'` is the only value for
now; the column exists so push transports never need a migration).
Subscribers are one-to-many endpoints — nothing may assume subscriber ↔
device is 1:1. No sequences anywhere — every id is an app-generated UUIDv7,
and the migration lint rejects serial/sequence defaults alongside the
missing-`environment_id` check, so id minting needs no cluster-wide
coordination and the schema stays distributable by `environment_id`.

**Single-org.** No organization concept anywhere — not in the schema, not in
the API, not in the admin UI. Environments are the isolation unit;
multi-tenancy is "run another instance". The admin plane is the sole, scoped
exception: it has instance-level **users with four fixed roles**
(`viewer`/`operator`/`developer`/`admin`, capability presets in
`server/src/roles.rs`). Roles are instance-wide — still no organizations, and
no per-environment user scoping. `admin_users`/`admin_sessions` are
instance-level tables (no `environment_id`), allowlisted in the migration
lint like the `environments` root.

**Licensing is settled:** AGPL-3.0 for `server/`
(OSI open source, copyleft — modify the server and offer it over a network
and you must publish the modified source per AGPL §13), MIT for
`packages/*` and `examples/`. The server is open source; the SDKs stay MIT
so they can embed in customer frontends. Keep the server's dependency tree
permissive: any copyleft transitive dependency in `server/` (including weak
copyleft — MPL, LGPL) must be flagged for review and explicitly allowed in
`server/deny.toml`, never waved through. The `cargo-deny` CI job is the
gate. SDK runtime dependencies must be permissive (they embed in customer
frontends). External code contributions require a CLA so the project keeps
relicensing and commercial-licensing flexibility.

## OpenAPI spec

- The spec is **code-first via utoipa**; `chimely openapi` exports it. The docs
  site and `@chimely/client` types are built from the export.
- `packages/client/src/generated/` and `docs/openapi/` are **generated**
  (`pnpm generate`) — never hand-edit them; regenerate and commit the result.

## Testing

- All DB tests run against **real Postgres + Redis via testcontainers** —
  no mocks for storage or pub/sub, ever. (cargo-nextest is the runner; CI
  also provides Postgres/Redis service containers.)
