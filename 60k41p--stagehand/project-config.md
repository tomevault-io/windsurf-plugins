- Use descriptive names for identifiers for variables and similar constructs over short ones.
- Use explicit type names instead of `auto` unless the type names are extremely long.
- Add code comments only when the code is not self-explanatory.
- Keep the tests up to date with code changes. If you add new features, add new tests for them. Maintain high test coverage for the project.
- Keep the files in documentation/ up to date with code changes.
- Don't clean build files.
