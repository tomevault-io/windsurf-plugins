## Repository Overview

Personal marketplace for Claude Code plugins. Plugins are developed under `plugins/` and released through `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

- Release-ready plugins: `notebooklm-connector`, `toolbox`, `vibeproxy-kit`, `vision-powers`, `worktree-plus`, `skill-creator-pro`, `codex-advisor`, `rubber-duck-tutor`
- Lab plugins (prefix `lab-` or `category: lab`): `e2e-test-runner`, `claw-mo`, `claw-mux`, `lab-harness-zero` (external repo)

## Directory Structure

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # Plugin registry (versions + sources)
plugins/<plugin-name>/            # Local plugin source (git-committed)
docs/                             # Knowledge base — see docs/INDEX.md
data/                             # Session and operational data
video/                            # Demo videos and media assets (gitignored)
references/                       # External reference repos (gitignored)
```

## Official Claude Code Docs

Always start with `https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt` — the full index of every Claude Code docs page. Fetch specific pages as `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/<page>`. Don't rely on memory or plan-internal citations; the index is the only authoritative source.

**Mandatory fetch when:**
- Creating new plugins, components (skills/agents/hooks/MCP), or schema changes
- Reviewing plans (`docs/superpowers/plans/*.md`) that cite official docs — verify each cited number against source. Plan-internal tables may contain invented or outdated values.

Skip only for minor text edits or bug fixes inside existing logic.

**Common starting pages (not exhaustive):** `plugins.md`, `plugins-reference.md`, `plugin-marketplaces.md`, `hooks.md`, `hooks-guide.md`, `skills.md`, `sub-agents.md`, `memory.md`, `env-vars.md`, `context-window.md`, `costs.md`, `how-claude-code-works.md`, `settings.md`.

**Other agents' docs:** For Codex (OpenAI): `https://developers.openai.com/llms.txt`.

## Plugin Development

Plugin creation and iteration is handled by the **skill-creator-pro** plugin — invoke `/skill-creator-pro` for all plugin development work.

### Plugin Component Structure

Standard layout inside `plugins/<plugin-name>/`:

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Plugin manifest
commands/                     # Slash commands (legacy; prefer skills/)
skills/                       # Skills with SKILL.md
agents/                       # Sub-agents (*.md)
hooks/                        # Hooks (hooks.json + scripts)
.mcp.json                    # MCP server config (optional)
.lsp.json                    # LSP server config (optional)
settings.json                # Only { "agent": "name" } is honored
```

Components (`commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`) live at the **plugin root**, not inside `.claude-plugin/`. See `docs/reference/gotchas.md` for the silent-fail modes.

### Workflow (creation, modification, refactoring)

1. **Docs** — For new plugins or structural changes, consult `docs/reference/` and official docs (`https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt`).
2. **Analysis** — User provides the goal and specific reference files. Read **only** those files.
3. **Implementation** — Create or modify files under `plugins/`. Never modify files in `references/`.
4. **Documentation** — If plugin behavior changed, update `README.md`. Also update the `description` in **both** `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` — removed features must be removed from descriptions too.
5. **Registration** — Add new plugins to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
6. **Validation** — Run `unset CLAUDECODE && claude plugin validate .` (unset avoids nested-session errors).

### Local Testing

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/<plugin-name>
```

If the same plugin is installed from the marketplace, both versions load and the cached copy may win. Disable the marketplace version before testing:

```bash
claude plugin disable <plugin-name>@claude-code-zero
claude plugin enable  <plugin-name>@claude-code-zero
```

## references/ Folder

Git-ignored. External open-source code for local reference only. Clone research repos into `references/<repo-name>`. **Never modify** — read, benchmark, and mine for patterns only.

## Git Workflow

### Branching

- **`develop`** — Working branch. All development happens here.
