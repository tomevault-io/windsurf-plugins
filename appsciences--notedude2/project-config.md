# Project Rules

## Git Workflow
- Always use feature branches for new features and bug fixes
- Create a corresponding GitHub issue before starting work
- Reference the issue in commits and PRs

## Testing
- E2E tests use Playwright (run with `npx playwright test`)
- Write tests before implementation (spec-driven development)
- All tests must pass before merging

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Playwright for E2E testing
