# AGENTS.md for the NioPD System

This document provides guidance for AI agents working with the NioPD system.

## 1. System Overview

NioPD is an AI-powered assistant system for Product Managers. It is designed to automate and assist with the core PM workflow, from defining high-level initiatives to tracking success metrics.

The system is file-based and command-driven. All data is stored in markdown files within the `niopd-workspace/` directory, and the AI's behavior is guided by a series of command prompts and agent definitions.

## 2. Core Philosophy: Agent-Driven Synthesis

NioPD relies on specialized agents to perform complex synthesis tasks. Unlike a general-purpose chatbot, NioPD uses agents to transform one type of document into another (e.g., turning feedback into a PRD, or turning initiatives into a roadmap).

Your primary role as an agent is to follow the instructions defined in the `commands/niopd/` and `agents/niopd/` directories to execute these transformations accurately.
