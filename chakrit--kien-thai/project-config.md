# PRODIGY9 Coding School

This project's AI coding environment is managed by [ACE](https://github.com/ace-rs/ace).
Run `ace` to start a coding session. Run `ace setup` if not yet configured.

Skills and conventions are provided by the **PRODIGY9 Coding School** school and are
symlinked into `.claude/skills/`. Skill edits go through symlinks into the school clone
— propose changes back to the school repo when ready. Run `ace config` or `ace paths`
to debug configuration issues.

## Project: kien-thai — what the skill teaches

A skills repo (open-source target) teaching Claude to write Thai prose that:

1. Reads as little like generic AI output as possible.
2. Has a distinct, believably human voice.
3. Is easy to read for native Thai readers (no brain damage).
4. Counters training-data skew toward over-formal / over-polite Thai.

Two skills:

- `skills/kien-thai/` — content rules: 7 frames + anti-patterns + style +
  register + examples.
- `skills/kode-thai/` — audit-loop trigger that invokes kien-thai to
  convergence.

School re-imports from here.

### Locked decisions — skill content

- No celebrity-columnist source material. Tech writing, bank long-form
  (non-sensational), younger newspaper voices, internationally-minded translators.
- No LLM-judge until human review proves insufficient.

## 🚨 Iteration discipline — READ FIRST 🚨

> **Rules don't get added on vibes. Trace before you write.**
>
> Every rule in `skills/kien-thai/` was synthesized from research into specific Thai
> writing sources (real tech blogs, bank long-form, young-newspaper features, skilled
> non-fiction translation). Each rule has a *why* — a failure mode it counters or a
> human-writing pattern it captures.
>
> **Rules without provenance rot. Don't grow the skill faster than the evidence does.**

When an eval output looks bad, the temptation is to immediately add a new rule or
tighten an existing one. **Resist this.** Trace first:

1. **Find the offending pattern** in the output.
2. **Map it to existing rules** — which rule was supposed to prevent this? Is it in
   `anti-patterns.md`, `style-rules.md`, `register.md`, or `examples.md`? If it's in
   none, that's a real gap.
3. **If a rule exists but didn't fire**: ask why. Was it buried? Phrased weakly?
   Conflicting with another rule? Wrong register applied? Fix the existing rule's
   wording, prominence, or anchoring example — don't pile on a new rule that says
   the same thing differently.
4. **If no rule covers it**: before adding one, check the source-research evidence.
   Is this a pattern the research surfaced? If yes, surface the existing observation
   into a rule. If no, the new rule is speculative — flag it as such, add only with
   a concrete citation or counter-example, and keep it provisional.
5. **Document the trace** in `iteration-N/feedback.md` so the rule's origin survives.

## Authoring the skill

Everything below is about *how we build and iterate the skill*, not about Thai prose
itself.

```

### Eval strategy

Two-stage, per skill-creator doctrine — subjective prose is judged by humans, not
assertions.

- **Stage 1 (generate)**: `pytest -m generate` invokes
  `claude --bare --disable-slash-commands -p` and `codex exec` in their bare modes.
  Skill is injected via prompt prepend (only diff between with_skill and baseline).
  Outputs land in
  `iteration-N/<eval>/<backend>/<config>/{output.md,prompt.txt,meta.json}`.
- **Stage 2 (review)**: human + Claude review artifacts inline in the chat. No browser
  viewer (yet). Cross-check across backends to mitigate self-judge bias. Consolidated
  notes go to `iteration-N/feedback.md` and graduate into `references/*.md`.
- **`test_quant.py`** is advisory only — flags forbidden phrases and connective
  density. Not a quality gate.

### Commands

```
uv sync                                  # one-time deps
uv run pytest                            # sanity (fast, default)
uv run pytest -m generate                # produce artifacts (slow, $$$)
uv run pytest -m generate -n 4 -k claude # parallel, one backend
uv run pytest -m evaluate                # advisory heuristics on latest iteration
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `codex` logged in. Tests skip gracefully if a backend
is missing.
