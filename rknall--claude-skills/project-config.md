# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **Claude Code Skills Marketplace** containing custom skills that extend Claude's capabilities. Skills are specialized prompts with supporting documentation that guide Claude to perform expert-level tasks in specific domains.

## Repository Structure

```
Skills/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json          # Marketplace configuration with all skills metadata
├── {skill-name}/                 # Each skill has its own directory
│   ├── SKILL.md                  # Main skill definition with YAML frontmatter (REQUIRED)
│   ├── README.md                 # User-facing documentation (REQUIRED)
│   └── *.md                      # Supporting resources (checklists, patterns, templates)
└── CLAUDE.md                     # This file
```

## Skill Categories

Current skills are organized into two categories:

**Development**: Architecture and design reviews
- `python-architecture-review`: Backend Python application architecture reviews
- `ui-design-review`: UI/UX and WCAG 2.1/2.2 accessibility compliance reviews

**Design**: Creative generation and design work
- `web-design-builder`: HTML5/JavaScript web design generation with Playwright verification
- `svg-logo-designer`: Professional SVG logo creation with multiple variations

## Working with Skills

### Skill File Structure

Every skill MUST have this structure:

**SKILL.md** (Required):
```markdown
---
name: "Display Name"
description: "What the skill does and WHEN to use it. Be explicit about trigger phrases."
---

# Skill Name

[Comprehensive instructions for Claude...]
```

**README.md** (Required):
- User-facing documentation
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- When to use the skill

**Supporting Files** (Optional but recommended):
- Checklists (e.g., `wcag-checklist.md`, `architecture-checklist.md`)
- Pattern libraries (e.g., `common-patterns.md`, `design-patterns-library.md`)
- Reference materials (e.g., `technology-recommendations.md`, `design-templates.md`)

### Skill Design Principles

1. **Comprehensive Instructions**: Skills should contain detailed, step-by-step workflows that Claude can follow autonomously
2. **Clear Triggers**: The `description` field must explicitly state when Claude should use this skill
3. **Supporting Resources**: Complex skills should include reference materials that Claude can consult
4. **Structured Output**: Skills should define clear output formats and deliverables
5. **Best Practices**: Include domain-specific best practices and current (2025) recommendations

### Creating New Skills

When adding a new skill:

1. **Create skill directory**: `mkdir new-skill-name`
2. **Create SKILL.md** with YAML frontmatter and comprehensive instructions
3. **Create README.md** with user documentation
4. **Add supporting resources** as separate `.md` files
5. **Update marketplace.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "skill-name",
     "source": "./skill-name",
     "description": "Clear description with trigger phrases",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "category": "development" | "design"
   }
   ```
6. **Update main README.md** with new skill documentation
7. **Increment marketplace version** in `marketplace.json`

### Modifying Existing Skills

When updating a skill:

1. **Edit skill files** (SKILL.md, README.md, supporting docs)
2. **Update version number** in `marketplace.json`
3. **Update main README.md** if significant changes
4. **Document changes** in README.md version history
5. **Test locally** before committing

## Marketplace Configuration

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file is the source of truth for:
- Marketplace metadata (name, version, description)
- All available skills and their metadata
- Skill categorization

**Current marketplace version**: Check `marketplace.json` for latest version

## Testing Skills Locally

Before committing skill changes:

1. Install the skill locally:
   ```bash
   /plugin install skill-name
   ```

2. Test by triggering the skill with appropriate prompts

3. Verify all supporting resources are accessible

4. Check that output matches expected format
