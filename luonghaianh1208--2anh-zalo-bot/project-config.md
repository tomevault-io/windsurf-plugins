# Installing 2Anh Zalo Bot into Hermes Agent

When the user asks you to install this repository, perform the installation instead of only describing it.

## Required workflow

1. Confirm that Node.js 22 or newer is available with `node --version`.
2. Locate the existing Hermes home or source checkout. A Hermes home normally contains `config.yaml` and a `hermes-agent/` child; a source checkout contains `pyproject.toml`, `gateway/`, and `plugins/`.
3. Ask whether the customer wants the optional offline Vietnamese voice provider. Explain that VieNeu v3 Nano needs no API key or GPU, downloads about 282 MB on first use, runs on CPU, and is most comfortable when the always-on machine keeps about 10 GB RAM available. It uses the Northern Vietnamese male voice `Minh Quân` and falls back to Edge TTS. Never opt in on the customer's behalf.
4. Run `npm ci` in this repository.
5. Run `npm run install:hermes -- --hermes-home <resolved-path>`. Append `--vieneu-tts` only when the customer explicitly agreed in step 3.
6. Run `npm run doctor -- --hermes-home <resolved-path>` and report every failed check.
7. Ask the customer two questions before finishing. Formatting (bold labels, dashes/bullets, sparing color, no `---`) is universal, already installed by step 5 from `hermes-plugin/zalo-style-guide.md`, and needs no question. Tone and group behavior are specific to each customer and must be asked — a school bot, a shop bot, and a friend-group bot should not sound the same:
   - **Tone** — how should the bot talk? Formal or casual? How does it address people? Emoji or not? Offer a few starting points to make choosing easy: formal for an office or school, friendly for a shop, playful for a group of friends.
   - **Group behavior** — should it greet itself when added to a new group? Should it reply when not tagged? Safe defaults: **no** self-introduction, **only** reply when tagged.
   Append the customer's answers to `platform_hints.zalo.append` in Hermes's `config.yaml`, after the formatting guide already written there — do not overwrite that guide, and do not invent a tone on the customer's behalf. If nobody can be asked (unattended install), keep the safe defaults above and tell the customer plainly that defaults were used.
8. If doctor passes, tell the user to run `npm start`, open `http://127.0.0.1:3872`, scan the QR code with a secondary Zalo account, and configure their owner UID.

Do not print `.env`, cookies, bridge tokens, Zalo session data, SQLite contents, or API keys. Do not copy `data/`, `.env`, logs, databases, or `node_modules` into Hermes. Do not start or restart an existing Hermes service unless the user explicitly asks. Do not patch Hermes core files.

If the customer cannot be asked interactively, omit `--vieneu-tts`. The default installation must never alter an existing TTS provider.

The installer is idempotent. Use the same install command for upgrades. Use `npm run uninstall:hermes -- --hermes-home <resolved-path>` only when the user explicitly asks to uninstall; it preserves the sidecar `.env`, Zalo session/history, and Hermes `config.yaml`.
