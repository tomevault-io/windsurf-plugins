# JavaScript conventions

Formatting, semicolons, quotes, and mechanical rules (`no-var`, `prefer-const`,
`no-eval`, `no-extend-native`) are enforced by **ESLint + Prettier** — not restated here.
This rule only encodes choices a linter won't make for you.

- `const` by default; `let` only when reassigned; never `var`.
- Prefer `async`/`await` over `.then()` chains. Use `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` to bound `fetch`.
- For parallel work where partial failure is acceptable, use `Promise.allSettled` (not
  `Promise.all`, which rejects on the first failure).
- Treat data as immutable: `map`/`filter`/`reduce`/spread instead of mutating inputs.
- Use `#private` class fields (not `_`-prefixed names). Use `WeakMap`/`WeakSet` for
  object-keyed metadata so entries can be garbage-collected.
- Never `eval()` / `new Function()` on dynamic input; never modify built-in prototypes.
- In untyped `.js` files, type via JSDoc: `@typedef` and `/** @type {import('./types').X} */`.
