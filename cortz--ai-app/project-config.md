# Pull Request Conventions

Defines clear rules for writing commit messages and pull request descriptions. Optimized for readability, precision, and integration with downstream systems.

## Inspect the Pull Request

Before generating a commit description, always gather full context:

1. Get the list of commits included in the branch:
   ```bash
   git --no-pager log --format=%s --reverse $(git merge-base HEAD main)..HEAD

2. Review the full diff against the main branch:

   `git --no-pager diff main`

3. If the diff doesn’t provide enough context, inspect the full files involved to understand broader structural or logic changes.

# Pull Request Titles and Descriptions

Establishes consistent rules for writing pull request titles and descriptions. These standards improve clarity and enable downstream integration with other systems.

## Writing a Clear Title

Follow these conventions when writing a pull request title:

- Use the **imperative mood** (e.g., `Fix`, `Add`, `Upgrade`, `Refactor`)
- Write as a plain sentence — avoid Title Case
- Do **not** end the title with a period
- Keep it short, focused, and descriptive

> ✅ Example: `Add loading indicator to dashboard chart`

## Writing a Clear Description

Structure all pull request descriptions using the following sections and formatting rules.

### General Conventions

- Use **imperative tone** in all sentences (e.g., `Add`, `Remove`, `Refactor`)
- Wrap code-related terms in backticks — including filenames, class names, env vars, and CLI commands
- Avoid personal pronouns (e.g., “we”, “our”, “they”)
- Never use the terms “Pull Request”, “PR”, or abbreviations
- Avoid generic statements like “clean up code” or “improve maintainability”
- Focus on **functional changes** and the reasons behind them

### Required Sections

#### Summary & Motivation

This section should:

- Begin with the primary functional change
- Use bullet points for multiple related changes
- Mention smaller or cleanup-related changes last to avoid distraction

#### Downstream Projects (if applicable)

Include this section only if the changes require manual updates in downstream projects. All downstream implementations follow the same structure as `AccountManagement` and `BackOffice`.

This section should:

- Open with a clear note to downstream maintainers
- Use a **numbered list** for each required change
- For each item, include:
  - The exact filename (e.g., `your-self-contained-system/WebApp/Foo.tsx`)
  - Any code to be added or updated
  - Git-style diffs when applicable using proper ```diff formatting
- For large changes, instruct maintainers to mirror changes from `AccountManagement` and `BackOffice`
- Use the placeholder term `your-self-contained-system` when referencing downstream locations

## Pull Request Description Template

```markdown
### Summary & motivation

- Describe the main functional change
- Bullet additional changes if needed
- Mention cleanup tasks last

## Markdown Requirements

Pull request descriptions must be written in valid Markdown.  
If the content contains nested code blocks, offer to save the result as a file named `###-branch-name.md` in the root of the repository.
