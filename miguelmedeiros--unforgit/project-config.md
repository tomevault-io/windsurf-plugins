# Docker Rebuild After Changes

After making any code changes to the project, always rebuild and restart the Docker containers so the changes are reflected immediately:

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

Run this from the project root (`/Users/miguelmedeiros/code/unforgit`).
