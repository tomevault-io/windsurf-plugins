# Unforgit Memory Integration

You have access to `unforgit_recall` and `unforgit_add` MCP tools for persistent repository memory across sessions.

## 1. Recall at the Start

At the **beginning of every conversation**, use the `unforgit_recall` tool with a query based on the user's first message to retrieve relevant context from past sessions.

Use recalled memories to avoid repeating past mistakes, follow known conventions, and apply previous decisions.

## 2. Save During the Conversation

Save memories **as soon as something noteworthy happens** — don't wait until the end.

Trigger a save with the `unforgit_add` tool immediately after:
- A bug is found and fixed
- An architectural or design decision is made
- A non-obvious gotcha or workaround is discovered
- A new convention or pattern is established
- A deployment/setup procedure is figured out

### Memory types

| Type | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `semantic` | Decisions, conventions, architecture facts | "We use UTC timestamps everywhere" |
| `procedural` | Workflows, how-tos, playbooks | "To deploy: run make release, then kubectl apply" |
| `episodic` | Bugs found, gotchas, observations | "Found race condition in queue worker" |

### Rules

- Keep text concise but self-contained — a future reader should understand it without extra context
- Use meaningful tags for discoverability (e.g. `["auth", "bug"]`, `["deploy", "playbook"]`)
- Prefer `semantic` for stable facts, `procedural` for how-tos, `episodic` for transient observations
- Do NOT save trivial changes, obvious things, or info already in the codebase docs
- Quality over quantity — only save what's genuinely useful for future sessions
- **Always write memory text in English**, regardless of the language the user is speaking
