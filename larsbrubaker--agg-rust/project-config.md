# Claude Code Guidelines

## Project Phase

The core AGG 2.6 port is now **mostly complete**. The project has entered a post-port phase where:

- Rust-idiomatic improvements and extensions beyond the C++ original are welcome
- New APIs that don't exist in C++ AGG may be added when they provide real-world value
- The strict "exact C++ behavioral match" requirement still governs all ported functionality
- Extensions must not modify or break any existing ported behavior
- Every extension must have tests that verify correctness against the existing ported baseline

**Guidelines for new extensions:**
1. Clear, demonstrated real-world use case (not speculative)
2. Tests that prove correctness — ideally a round-trip or comparison against the equivalent existing API
3. Clean Rust-idiomatic API design; document any invariants or limitations the caller must respect
4. No exposure of internal implementation details as public API — use `pub(crate)` for helpers that bridge modules

## Philosophy

**Quality through iterations** - Start with correct implementations, then improve. Code that doesn't matter can be quick and dirty. But code that matters *really* matters—treat it with respect and improve it meticulously. In a porting project, every function matters.

**Circumstances alter cases** - Use judgment. There are no rigid rules—context determines the right approach. However, this project has strong defaults because porting demands precision.

**No stubs, no shortcuts** - Every function must be complete and production-ready. No `todo!()`, no `unimplemented!()`, no `panic!("not implemented")`, no partial implementations. If dependencies aren't ready, stop and implement them first.

## Test-First Bug Fixing (Critical Practice)

**This is the single most important practice for agent performance and reliability.**

When a bug is reported, always follow this workflow:

1. **Write a reproducing test first** - Create a test that fails, demonstrating the bug
2. **Fix the bug** - Make the minimal change needed to address the issue
3. **Verify via passing test** - The previously failing test should now pass

This approach works because:
- The failing test proves you understand the bug
- The fix is verifiable, not just "looks right"
- You can't accidentally break it again (regression protection)
- It aligns with the principle that coding is high-leverage because it's **partially verifiable**

**Do not skip the reproducing test.** Even if the fix seems obvious, the test validates your understanding and prevents regressions.

## Testing

- Tests MUST test actual production code, not copies - Never duplicate production logic in tests. Import and call the real code. Tests that verify copied code prove nothing about the actual system.
- Tests should run as fast as possible—fast tests get run more often
- Write tests for regressions and complex logic
- Avoid redundant tests that verify the same behavior
- All tests must pass before merging
- Tests must verify **exact behavioral match** with the C++ implementation
- When test failures occur, use the fix-test-failures agent (`.claude/agents/fix-test-failures.md`) — it treats all failures as real bugs and resolves them through instrumentation and root cause analysis, never by weakening tests
- For pixel-perfect rendering validation, compare rendered pixel buffers byte-for-byte with C++ output

**Running tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific module
cargo test --lib basics_tests
cargo test --lib color_tests

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_name -- --exact

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Code Quality

**Names** - Choose carefully. Good names make code self-documenting. Rust names should follow Rust conventions (`snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants).

**Comments** - Explain *why*, not *what*. The code shows what it does; comments should reveal intent, tradeoffs, and non-obvious reasoning. When porting from C++, comments explaining *why* the Rust approach differs from C++ are especially valuable.

**Refactoring** - Improve code when it serves a purpose, not for aesthetics. Refactor to fix bugs, add features, or improve clarity when you're already working in that area.

## C++ to Rust Porting Rules

This project is a strict port of the AGG 2.6 C++ library to Rust. These rules ensure fidelity:

### Exact Behavioral Matching
- Rust implementation must match C++ behavior exactly
- Same algorithms, same mathematical precision
- Same edge case handling, same error conditions
- Same performance characteristics (or better)
- Pixel-perfect rendering output (byte-for-byte match with C++ rendered buffers)
- No "close enough" implementations

### Template-to-Trait Mapping

AGG uses heavy C++ templates. The Rust equivalents:

| C++ Pattern | Rust Approach |
|------------|---------------|
| `template<class ColorT>` pixel formats | `trait Color` + generic structs |
| `template<class VertexSource>` converters | `trait VertexSource` + generic converters |
| `template<class Scanline>` renderers | `trait Scanline` + generic renderers |
| `template<class Rasterizer>` render fns | Generic functions with trait bounds |
