## When Editing

This package only contains re-exports. If you need to add new functionality, add it to the appropriate sub-package, then ensure it's re-exported through the barrel files here:

- `src/index.ts` - Main re-exports
- `src/schemas/valibot.ts` - Aggregated valibot schemas
- `src/schemas/zod.ts` - Aggregated zod schemas
- `src/a2a/` - A2A re-exports
