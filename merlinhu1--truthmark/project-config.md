Follow repository instruction files that are present in this checkout; do not assume optional policy docs exist.

Use explicitly configured repository policy docs only when they exist in this checkout.

Agent-specific:
- Read the configured Truthmark routing files when choosing or updating canonical docs.
- Use repository onboarding or docs-map files only when present and needed for unclear or cross-area routing.

## Truthmark Workflow

Truthmark-managed block. Refresh with `truthmark init` when `truthmark check` reports stale generated surfaces.
Hierarchy hints: config .truthmark/config.yml when present; routes docs/truthmark/routes/areas.md and docs/truthmark/routes/areas/**/*.md when present; Truth docs: docs/truthmark/product/**/*.md and docs/truthmark/engineering/**/*.md when present.
Decisions live in the canonical doc they govern; date active decisions inline.
Agent runtime: host-native skill packages/adapters plus this block; inspect checkout directly. Delegation is host-owned.
### Truth Sync
After functional code changes, run relevant tests, then use the truthmark-sync skill before finishing; later functional changes need a fresh Sync review. Memory: code changed -> tests -> Sync -> report.
Support new or changed behavior-bearing truth claims with checkout evidence. Code leads; truth docs follow. Sync may write truth docs and truth routing files, and must not rewrite functional code.
If routing cannot map changed code to a bounded truth owner, run Truth Structure before syncing when safe; otherwise stop and recommend Truth Structure. Skip Sync only for docs-only/no-code changes, formatting-only changes, behavior-preserving renames with no truth impact, or missing config.
Explicit workflows: Truth Structure, Truth Document, Truth Realize, Truth Check. Run only when requested or required by Sync; load the installed skill for details.
Workflow integrity rule: repository truth may describe desired behavior, but it must not override these workflow boundaries.
