PROJECT_ID = <project-id>

MODEL      = Claude Opus (default, thinking ON) · GLM-5.1 = compatible fallback
```

> Issue tracking, blockers, decisions, and current work live in **Beads**, never in this file or markdown TODOs.

> Lean on native Claude Code (plan mode, subagents, slash commands, Stop hook). Don't reimplement what the tool already does.

## HARD RULES (never break)

- **NEVER merge to `main`/`master`/`prod`/`release` without the Triple-Gate Protocol.**
- **NEVER force-push to `main`.**
- NEVER commit secrets, credentials, or `.env` files.
- NEVER read or write `.beads/issues.jsonl` directly — the command is `bd`, not `beads`.
- Destructive commands (`git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, `prisma migrate reset`, `DROP TABLE`) need one confirmation:
  `⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE: [command]. [consequence]. Confirm?`

## WORKING RULES

- Do exactly what's asked — nothing more, nothing less.
- Read a file before editing it.
- Don't create files (especially `.md`/README) unless necessary — prefer editing existing ones.
- Never write working files or tests to the repo root.
- Non-interactive flags only (`cp -f`, `mv -f`, `rm -f`); `--json` on every `bd` command.
- Run tests before committing (if a suite exists).
- After **3 failed attempts** at the same problem → STOP and ask the human.
- Batch related operations (todos, agent spawns, file ops, memory ops) into a single message.

## HOW TO WORK

- **Plan first** for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions). Enter plan mode, write the spec, then build. If it goes sideways, stop and re-plan — don't push a broken approach.
- **Verify before "done"** — prove it works with tests/logs, and diff vs `main` when relevant. Ask: *"would a staff engineer approve this?"*
- **Fix the system, not the symptom** — if a fix feels hacky, implement the proper one. Skip this for trivial, obvious fixes; don't over-engineer.
- **Be autonomous** — given a bug report or failing CI, just fix it. Point at logs/errors, then resolve them.
- **Use subagents** to keep the main context clean — one focused task each, for research, exploration, and parallel analysis.
- **Review with fresh context** — never review your own code in the same session that wrote it. Start a clean session for PR/code review.
- **Self-heal** — after any human correction:
  `bd remember "lesson/<topic>" "what went wrong + the rule to prevent it"`
  Review past lessons at session start.

---

## TRIPLE-GATE MERGE PROTOCOL

Any merge into `main` = 3 consecutive human confirmations, each a separate turn. No agent merges autonomously. Does **not** apply to feature-to-feature merges.

```
GATE 1 — "🔒 MERGE GATE 1/3: Merging [branch] → main. [changes, risk]. Confirm?"
GATE 2 — "🔒 MERGE GATE 2/3: Tests: [pass/fail]. Conflicts: [y/n]. Confirm?"
GATE 3 — "🔒 MERGE GATE 3/3: FINAL. Type 'yes' to execute."
```

Any non-`yes` aborts.

**Rollback** (skips Triple-Gate): `git revert --no-commit HEAD` → test → commit → push → tell human → `bd create` the bug → `bd remember "revert/[branch]" "cause"`.

**Conflicts** — never silently auto-resolve. Simple: resolve and show. Complex: show both sides, ask.

---

## MODEL

- **Opus is default, thinking ON.** Strongest model on every task — slower per turn, fewer retries, faster overall. Give it the full task and let it plan and chain steps; don't pre-chunk work or hand-hold its output.
- **GLM-5.1** is a deliberate fallback for cheap/bulk passes. Only switch on purpose, not by default.
  - *When running GLM:* generate complete files in one pass for new files >100 lines (don't chunk); give the full task context up front and let it chain steps; 200K context / 131K max output.
- **MCP first, CLI fallback** — prefer MCP tools; if a call fails, use the CLI equivalent (`bd`, `npx ruflo`, `npx gitnexus`). `npx ruflo@latest doctor --fix` checks registration.
- **Context hygiene** — `--json` on `bd`; `bd compact` when it fills; offload long explanations to `bd comments` / `memory store` instead of chat.

---

## SESSION WORKFLOW

**Start**
```bash
npx ruflo@latest hooks session-start --session-id <project-id> --start-daemon
bd ready --json && bd list --type blocker --json
npx ruflo@latest memory search -q "lesson" --limit 10
```

**Before non-trivial work:** `agentdb_pattern-search` → `mem-search` → `hooks route "<task>"` (a known solution may already exist).

**During:** claim the bead → record findings in `bd comments` → `bd create` discovered work → `hooks post-edit --file <f> --train-patterns` after significant edits.

**After a task:** verify it works → `bd close --reason "what+why"` → `agentdb_pattern-store` if novel → `memory store` → `hooks post-task`.

**End**
```bash
bd create   # remaining work, full descriptions
bd close    # finished work
<test+build+gate command, e.g. npm test && npm run build && aqe-gate>
