# Releasing AdLoop

## How publishing works

AdLoop uses **PyPI Trusted Publishing** via GitHub Actions. No API tokens or secrets are stored in the repo. PyPI verifies the publish request came from this exact repo and workflow via OIDC.

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): runs tests on every push to `main` and every PR, across Python 3.11-3.13.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): triggered by pushing a `v*` tag. Builds the package, publishes to PyPI, and creates a GitHub Release.

## When to release

Release after merging PRs that add features, fix bugs, or change the public tool interface. Not every merge needs a release — batch small fixes.

## Release process

When the user asks to release, or after significant changes are merged:

1. **Decide the version bump** following semver:
   - **Patch** (0.2.1): bug fixes, doc changes, internal refactors
   - **Minor** (0.3.0): new tools, new parameters on existing tools, new features
   - **Major** (1.0.0): breaking changes to tool signatures or config format

2. **Bump the version in both places** (they must match):
   - `pyproject.toml` → `version = "X.Y.Z"`
   - `src/adloop/__init__.py` → `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`

3. **Commit and tag**:
   ```bash
   git add pyproject.toml src/adloop/__init__.py
   git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z: <one-line headline>"
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions handles the build and publish**: tests run, package builds, publishes to PyPI, creates a GitHub Release. The auto-created release body is just a compare link — the human-written notes go on next (step 5).

5. **Write the GitHub Release notes** — this is the canonical changelog. We do **not** maintain a `CHANGELOG.md`; every version's notes live on its GitHub Release page (e.g. https://github.com/kLOsk/adloop/releases/tag/v0.6.0). Draft the notes locally, then attach them once the release workflow has finished creating the release:

   ```bash
   gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file /tmp/adloop-vX.Y.Z-notes.md
   ```

   Format matches recent releases (v0.6.0 is the reference):

   - **H2 title** — `## vX.Y.Z — <headline>`.
   - **Lede paragraph** — what the release does and who's affected, in plain language.
   - **H3 sections**, chosen based on the kind of release. Pick what applies:
     - *The bug / the fix* (bug-fix releases) — explain the root cause end-to-end and the fix, with links to any upstream issues.
     - *New tools* — one bullet per tool with signature, behaviour, and what it's for.
     - *Updated orchestration rules* — when `.cursor/rules/adloop.mdc` or `.claude/rules/adloop.md` changed.
     - *Safety* — how the change flows through the preview / dry-run / confirm pipeline, or any new guardrails.
     - *Verification* — test counts (unit + behavioural), live API verification, anything else run to validate.
     - *Also in this release* — smaller, related items bundled with the headline change.
     - *Action for maintainers* — if the release introduces a temporary workaround, deprecation, or follow-up task, spell out the exact condition under which to remove it.
   - **Install / upgrade** — `pipx upgrade adloop`, `pip install --upgrade adloop`, or `uvx adloop@X.Y.Z`. Mention restarting the MCP host when relevant.
   - **Credits** — named contributors (GitHub handles) and what they contributed. Link the PR.
   - **Full Changelog compare link** at the bottom: `**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/kLOsk/adloop/compare/vPREV...vX.Y.Z`.

   Keep the notes narrative and useful — explain *why* the release matters, not just what changed. Match the tone of https://github.com/kLOsk/adloop/releases/tag/v0.6.0 and https://github.com/kLOsk/adloop/releases/tag/v0.6.3.

6. **Verify**: check the Actions tab on GitHub, confirm the package appears on https://pypi.org/project/adloop/, and eyeball the rendered release page to make sure the markdown looks right.

## Troubleshooting

- If the release workflow fails on the publish step, the user needs to verify that the trusted publisher is configured on PyPI: https://pypi.org/manage/project/adloop/settings/publishing/ (Owner: `kLOsk`, Repo: `adloop`, Workflow: `release.yml`, Environment: `pypi`).
- If tests fail in the release workflow, the tag still exists. Fix the issue, delete the tag (`git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`), then re-tag after the fix.
- The version in `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` must always match. If they drift, fix both before releasing.
