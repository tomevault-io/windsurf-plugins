# No Thread Threshold Optimization

APAS-VERUS is a textbook implementation. Do not add threshold checks to switch between parallel and sequential execution for small inputs.

In production code you would add:
```rust
if n < THRESHOLD { sequential() } else { parallel() }
```

We don't do this here. The code demonstrates the parallel algorithm structure, not production-optimized performance.
