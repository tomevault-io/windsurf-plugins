- **Pool** — contribute capital to a shared managed vault
- **Subscribe** — receive webhook events on regime changes

```
Agent: "Hire me"
→ "I'll monitor HBAR volatility and alert you when thresholds are crossed."

Agent: "Pool 1000 HBAR"
→ "Added to pool. Managing with current volatility strategy."

Agent: "Subscribe to volatility alerts"
→ "Subscribed. Alerts fire at 15%, 30%, and 50% crossings."
