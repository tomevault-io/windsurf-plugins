# Calculations and Testing

## calculations.js — Pure Functions

All business logic lives in `src/lib/calculations.js` as pure, side-effect-free functions. This separation is intentional — keep it that way.

Key functions:
- `calcMaxContext(model, userVram)` — max context (K tokens) that fits in VRAM
- `calcTokPerSec(model, bandwidth)` — estimated decode tokens/sec
- `bucketModels(allModels, vram, bandwidth, minContextK, minTokPerSec)` — sorts models into fits/tight/noFit
- `qualityTier(score)` — MMLU score → { label, cls } tier
- `contextLabel(k)`, `tokLabel(tps)` — display formatting

## Core Formulas

```
max_context_k = floor((vram - weight_gb) / kv_per_1k_gb)   [capped at model max]
tok/s = round(bandwidth / (weight_gb + 1.0))                [1.0 GB overhead constant]
```

- `INFERENCE_OVERHEAD_GB = 1.0` — empirically calibrated, do not change without benchmarks
- `TIGHT_FIT_CONTEXT_K = 4` — models below 4K context are always "tight fit"

## Testing

Tests are in `src/lib/calculations.test.js` using Vitest. Run with `npm test`.

When modifying calculation functions:
1. Update or add tests for any changed behavior
2. Use the existing fixture pattern (`smallModel`, `mediumModel`, `largeModel`)
3. Include edge cases (zero VRAM, null bandwidth, empty model list)
4. Add a comment showing the math: `// 24 GB VRAM, 8.99 GB weights → 15.01 / 0.25 = 60K`

Do not put calculation logic in Svelte components — extract it to `calculations.js` and test it.
