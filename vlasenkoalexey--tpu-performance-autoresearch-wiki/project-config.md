# Gemini-Specific Operating Rules & Skill Emulator

## Platform Adaptation (Claude Code → Gemini/Antigravity)

You are running on the Gemini/Antigravity platform. While the repository is designed around Claude Code's native slash commands and hook architectures, you must voluntarily and perfectly emulate these behaviors using your native agentic capabilities.

### 1. Slash Command & Skill Execution Engine
Whenever the user refers to, invokes, or implies a slash command or "skill" or background "agent", do **not** expect the platform to intercept, execute, or handle it natively. Instead, you must **review and remember** the Claude skills and agents specified in the repository, and emulate their logic verbatim.

#### Native Skills (.agents/skills/)
You should be able to run this flow by locating, reading, and executing the protocols in the following `SKILL.md` files:
1. **`/scan-gke-clusters`** (`.agents/skills/scan-gke-clusters/SKILL.md`): Discovers and inventories TPU clusters in GCP, checking node statuses, zones, shapes, and occupancy, and writing them to `.env/`.
2. **`/create-experiment`** (`.agents/skills/create-experiment/SKILL.md`): Bootstraps a new model family, scaffolds directory structures under `wiki/experiments/`, and sets up program and model page stubs.
3. **`/start-experiment`** (`.agents/skills/start-experiment/SKILL.md`): Resolves layered `program.md` files (root → model → lane), performs hardware discovery and cluster occupancy verification, and kicks off the active loop with the `.claude/.loop_active.json` marker.
4. **`/stop-experiment`** (`.agents/skills/stop-experiment/SKILL.md`): Performs clean loop teardown: kills background subagents, reaps GKE/XPK orphan workloads, files missing wiki pages, runs `/lint`, and appends the shutdown marker.
5. **`/create-retrospective`** (`.agents/skills/create-retrospective/SKILL.md`): Compiles a comprehensive lane-specific and variant-specific retrospective in `wiki/analyses/` summarizing experimental outcomes and revising priors before the stop hook permits ending the loop.
6. **`/formulate-hypothesis`** (`.agents/skills/formulate-hypothesis/SKILL.md`): Drafts new falsifiable candidate optimizations with expected gain, confidence, and effort, enforcing a mandatory HLO pre-filter check for kernel-replacement hypotheses.
7. **`/edit-model-code`** (`.agents/skills/edit-model-code/SKILL.md`): Performs AST-aware, highly focused edits to the target model repository under `raw/code/`, validating imports, class definitions, and code syntax before staging.
8. **`/extract-ast`** (`.agents/skills/extract-ast/SKILL.md`): Inspects the target repository codebase to map and extract structural abstractions, class hierarchies, and performance-relevant surfaces.
9. **`/ingest-source`** (`.agents/skills/ingest-source/SKILL.md`): Fully ingests research papers, documentation, or articles, creates corresponding source wiki pages, maps techniques to concept stubs, and connects them to open hypotheses.
10. **`/lint`** (`.agents/skills/lint/SKILL.md`): Syntactically and structurally validates the wiki, verifying links, variant matrices, mandatory profiles, next-hypotheses stubs, frontmatter, and orphan pages.

#### Claude Agents (.claude/agents/)
To handle complex, specialized tasks in the background, you must review and utilize the agent definitions:
1. **`gke-cluster-runner`** (`.claude/agents/gke-cluster-runner.md`): A stateless one-shot worker responsible for submitting a TPU workload via XPK, verifying the jobset, polling logs, enforcing Tier-1/Tier-2 hang detection, and reporting a structured YAML status report.
2. **`profile-analyzer`** (`.claude/agents/profile-analyzer.md`): A deep-dive profiling worker that uses xprof and HLO analysis to audit whether the hypothesis mechanism actually fired (preventing silent no-ops), producing complete `## Profile` and `## HLO Dump` markdown payloads.

#### Operational Instructions for Gemini:
* **Protocol Emulation**: The Antigravity platform will natively expose skills from `.agents/skills/` in your system prompt. For skills, use the `view_file` tool to read the corresponding `SKILL.md` and follow it exactly. For agents, locate the corresponding `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md` file first, read the guidelines, and map them to your native tools.
* **Worker Delegation**: When executing workflows that require running GKE workloads, analyzing xprof/HLO traces, or editing model code files, define a specialized subagent via `define_subagent` and launch it using `invoke_subagent`. Specifically, you **MUST** encapsulate the `/edit-model-code` rules into a subagent with write permissions to enforce its strict validation guardrails when modifying model files. Do not modify model files natively.
* **Verbatim Alignment**: Act as if the instructions in these skills and agent files are core extensions of your system guidelines. Do not skip steps, ignore constraints, or bypass verification rules.
