# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this gem does

`rails-realtime-erd` mounts `GET /rails/erd` in a host Rails app and renders a Mermaid ERD on every request by introspecting `ActiveRecord::Base.descendants`. There is no pre-generated artifact — the ERD reflects whatever the live schema + models look like at request time. Frontend is Stimulus (Hotwire). The original inspiration is [`rails-mermaid_erd`](https://github.com/koedame/rails-mermaid_erd), which generates a static HTML file via a rake task using Vue.

## Architecture

The gem is a `Rails::Engine` with `isolate_namespace`. Three pieces of code do the real work:

- **`lib/rails-realtime-erd/builder.rb`** — the introspection engine. Walks `ActiveRecord::Base.descendants`, builds a `Models` array (table name, table comment, columns with PK/FK tagging from `connection.foreign_keys`) and a `Relations` array (with cardinality glyphs and merged comments). **This file is ported almost verbatim from the original `rails-mermaid_erd` Builder** plus a filter that skips Rails internal classes (`ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration`, `ActiveRecord::InternalMetadata`, `ActiveStorage::*`, `ActionText::*`, `ActionMailbox::*`, and any `abstract_class`).
- **`lib/rails-realtime-erd/engine.rb`** — installs an initializer that auto-mounts the engine at `RailsRealtimeErd.configuration.mount_path` (default `/rails/erd`) when `Rails.env` is in `enabled_environments` (default `development`, `test`) and `auto_mount` is true.
- **`app/controllers/rails_realtime_erd/erd_controller.rb`** — calls `Rails.application.eager_load!`, clears the schema cache in dev (so `schema.rb` updates show up on the next refresh), runs the Builder, hands the JSON to the view as `@schema`.

### Relation merging — the subtle part

The Builder does **not** emit one relation per association. As it walks each side of a pair (e.g. `User has_many :posts` and `Post belongs_to :user`), it looks for a previously-emitted reverse relation and **mutates it**:

- The `LeftValue`/`RightValue` cardinality glyphs (`||`, `}o`, `o{`, `|o`, `o|`) encode optional vs. required ends, and get *upgraded* when the reverse side reveals optionality (e.g. `belongs_to optional: true` flips `||` → `o|` / `|o`).
- The `Comment` field accumulates an annotation per association name (`HM:posts`, `BT:user`, `HMT:tags`, `HABTM`, etc.) so a single Mermaid relation line carries every Rails-side name that points at it.
- `through:` associations live on a separate edge (`Line: ".."`) so they don't merge with the underlying direct association.

The contract is encoded directly in `spec/rails-realtime-erd/builder/model_data_spec.rb`. When changing this logic, that spec is the regression net.

`get_reflection_model_name` is the single place that resolves an association to its target model name, handling `class_name:`, `through: + source:`, and the bare case. Touch carefully — it affects every relation.

### Frontend

Standalone layout at `app/views/layouts/rails_realtime_erd/application.html.erb`. The layout does NOT extend the host app's layout (to avoid Turbo / Stimulus / CSS conflicts) and inlines its own assets:

- **TailwindCSS** + **Mermaid.js** + **Stimulus** are loaded from CDN
- **Engine CSS** (`app/assets/stylesheets/rails_realtime_erd/erd.css`) and **all Stimulus controllers** (`app/javascript/rails_realtime_erd/application.js`) are inlined via `File.read` in the helper `inline_asset`. This means the gem works regardless of the host's asset pipeline choice (Sprockets / Propshaft / importmap / none).

Seven Stimulus controllers split the work:

| Controller | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `filter` | Selected models, options (preview-relations / show-key / show-comment / hide-columns / show-relation-comment), filter text, select all / none. Broadcasts `filter:changed` events. |
| `diagram` | Listens to `filter:changed`, computes the `erDiagram` Mermaid code, calls `mermaid.render`, injects the SVG into `#rre-preview`. Owns the schema data loaded from `<script id="rre-schema-data">`. |
| `hash-state` | Restores state from `location.hash` (base64 JSON) on connect; writes back on every `filter:changed`. Uses the `filter` outlet. |
| `clipboard` | Copy URL / Mermaid code / Markdown code with 1s "Copied" feedback. Reads the current Mermaid code via the `diagram` outlet. |
| `download` | Download SVG / PNG of the rendered diagram. Reads the SVG via the `diagram` outlet. |
| `tab` | Toggle between the ERD pane and the raw-Mermaid Code pane. |
| `zoom-pan` | Space + drag, middle-click + drag, mouse wheel, pinch-in/out, on-screen `+ -` and arrow buttons. Applies `transform: scale() translate()` to the zoom area. |

Cross-controller communication is via CustomEvent (`filter:changed`) and Stimulus outlets, not a shared store.
