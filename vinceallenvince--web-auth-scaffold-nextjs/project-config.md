# Development

- To effectively work with this application, refer to the official documentation resources at [tech-documentation.md](mdc:docs/tech-documentation.md)
- Prefer server-first patterns: fetch and mutate data on the server
- Wrap third-party libraries in your own helpers/components
- Use "use client" only when you need interactivity (forms, modals, etc.)
- Break down UI into atomic components and wrap DaisyUI for reusability
- Keep business logic in lib/, not in components or route handlers
- Use shared types (e.g., User, Session) in types/ to prevent drift
- Keep your codebase clean — if it feels messy, it probably is. Refactor early.
