# TASKS.md Execution Guidelines

This file defines the technical roadmap for transforming the project. Cursor must use it as the single source of truth for implementation progress.

## Purpose

To track and manage the structured migration of the project through clearly defined, sequential tasks — **one task at a time**.

## Structure

- Organize tasks into thematic sections (e.g., Project Setup, Styling, Routing)
- Each section should use standard markdown checkboxes:

  ```markdown
  ## Section Name

  - [ ] Task to do
  - [x] Completed task
  ```

## Execution Rules for Cursor

### 1. Task Execution

- ✅ Always work on **exactly one `[ ]` task at a time**
- 🔁 Do **not skip ahead** unless explicitly instructed
- 🧠 Before executing a task, **read the task text carefully**
- 🤔 If anything is unclear (e.g., requirements, files, business logic), **ask the user before continuing**

### 2. After Each Task

- [x] Mark the task as complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
- 📁 If new files or folders were created, list them in a "Relevant Files" section
- 📌 If the task uncovers additional subtasks, append them under the correct section

### 3. File Maintenance

- Always keep `TASKS.md` up to date with:
  - Task completion
  - Additional discovered tasks
  - Clarifications or changes in scope

### 4. Implementation Logging (optional but encouraged)

- At the end of each section or complex task, add a note under an `## Notes` or `## Decisions` subsection explaining:
  - Why certain libraries or patterns were chosen
  - Key architecture decisions
  - Technical constraints or trade-offs

---

## AI Summary

When using this file, Cursor must:

1. Work through tasks **sequentially**, not in parallel
2. Ask for user input before acting if unclear
3. Mark tasks as `[x]` once complete
4. Only move to the next `[ ]` task after updating the file
5. Add any missing tasks discovered during implementation
6. Keep the file clean and readable at all times

This allows full visibility, traceability, and repeatability of the implementation process.
