# Development Rules

## Default Context

This repo contains multiple packages, but **`packages/coding-agent/`** is the primary focus. Unless otherwise specified, assume work refers to this package.

**Terminology**: When the user says "agent" or asks "why is agent doing X", they mean the **coding-agent package implementation**, not you (the assistant). The coding-agent is a CLI tool — questions about its behavior refer to code in `packages/coding-agent/`, not your current session.

### Package Structure

| Package                 | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/ai`           | Multi-provider LLM client with streaming support     |
| `packages/catalog`      | Model catalog: bundled models.json, provider descriptors, model identity/classification |
| `packages/agent`        | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management |
| `packages/coding-agent` | Main CLI application (primary focus)                 |
| `packages/tui`          | Terminal UI library with differential rendering      |
| `packages/natives`      | Bindings for native text/image/grep operations       |
| `packages/stats`        | Local observability dashboard (`omp stats`)          |
| `packages/utils`        | Shared utilities (logger, streams, temp files)       |
| `crates/pi-natives`     | Rust crate for performance-critical text/grep ops    |

**Catalog import convention**: code in this repo imports catalog *values* (bundled models, model-thinking helpers, identity, descriptors, model manager/cache) from `@oh-my-pi/pi-catalog/<module>` — never via `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`. The pi-ai barrel re-exports only the model/effort *types* its own signatures use (`Model`, `Api`, `ThinkingConfig`, `Effort`, …); type-only imports of those from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` are fine.

## Code Quality

- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **NEVER use `ReturnType<>`** — use the actual type name.
- **NEVER use inline imports** — no `await import()`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic type imports. Always top-level.
- Check `node_modules` for external API types instead of guessing.
- **Barrel exports**: prefer `export * from "./module"` over named re-exports, including `export type { ... } from`. In pure `index.ts` barrels, use star re-exports even for single-specifier cases. If stars create ambiguity, remove the redundant export path; do not keep duplicates.
- **Class privacy**: use ES `#private` fields; leave externally accessible members bare. **No `private`/`protected`/`public` keyword on fields or methods**, except on **constructor parameter properties** where TypeScript requires it (e.g. `constructor(private readonly session: ToolSession)`).
- **Promises**: use `Promise.withResolvers()` instead of `new Promise((resolve, reject) => ...)`.
- **Prompts**: never build prompts in code (no inline strings, template literals, or concatenation). Prompts live in static `.md` files; use Handlebars for dynamic content. Import them via `import content from "./prompt.md" with { type: "text" }` — not `readFile`.
- **Worker scripts**: workers re-enter the CLI entrypoint; never spawn separate worker entry modules. `cli.ts` declares itself as the worker host at startup (`declareWorkerHostEntry()` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/env`) and dispatches hidden argv selectors (`__omp_worker_stats_sync`, `__omp_worker_tab`, `__omp_worker_js_eval`, `__omp_worker_tiny_inference`) before loading the command registry. Spawn sites use:
  ```ts
  import { workerHostEntry } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";
  const hostEntry = workerHostEntry();
  const worker = hostEntry
    ? new Worker(hostEntry, { type: "module", argv: ["__omp_worker_<name>"] })
    : new Worker(new URL("./<worker>.ts", import.meta.url).href, { type: "module" });
  ```
  When the process was started from the omp CLI — source `cli.ts`, npm-bundle `dist/cli.js`, or compiled binary — `workerHostEntry()` is `Bun.main` and the worker re-enters the single entry module, so no per-worker `--compile` entrypoints or bundle entries exist. Outside a CLI host (`bun test`, SDK embedding, standalone `omp-stats`) it returns `null` and the direct-module fallback loads the worker source. New worker kinds MUST add their selector to the dispatch table in `cli.ts` and keep the fallback branch.
  History: `with { type: "file" }` only copied the entry as a raw asset (workers crashed silently in compiled binaries — issues #1011, #1027), and the later literal-path + extra-entrypoint pattern required keeping spawn literals and two build scripts in sync (issue #1150). The repro tests for those issues now pin the worker-host contract instead.
  Validate any new worker with the dedicated smoke probe: `omp --smoke-test` spawns the stats sync worker and the tiny-model subprocess, pings them, and exits — it's wired into `ci:test:smoke` and `scripts/install-tests/run-ci.sh` so binary, source-link, and tarball installs all exercise it. Add a sibling smoke if the new worker is on a different module graph.
