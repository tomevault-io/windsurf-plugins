# Agent Notes

This repository contains the read-only OpenSyria datasets API built with NestJS, Fastify, Prisma, and pnpm.

Work inside this repository only. Keep application code in `src`, Prisma assets in `prisma`, public data/configuration in their existing folders, and generated code in generated directories. Do not commit `.env`, database credentials, local generated scratch files, or private infrastructure details.

Use Node 24+ and pnpm 11+. Before handing off changes, run the smallest relevant command and prefer `pnpm validate` when changing API behavior, Prisma integration, generated clients, or shared modules:

- `pnpm check`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm test:e2e`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm validate`

## Documentation Freshness

- Treat this `AGENTS.md` as living agent documentation. When adding, removing, or renaming a repo-local skill under `.agents/skills`, update the `Local Skills` list in this file in the same change.
- When adding, removing, renaming, or changing public controllers, DTOs, response envelopes, pagination, filtering, localization, rate limits, health checks, or error behavior under `src/api`, update `README.md` public routes/query sections and `docs/api-standards.md`.
- When changing dataset release configuration, `dataset-releases.json`, release source parsing, GitHub sync behavior, local release loading, release manifest validation, or artifact layout, update `docs/dataset-loading.md` and `docs/release-manifest.md`.
- When changing Prisma models, migrations, read-model import/query logic, cache behavior, or CLI refresh commands, update `docs/read-model-architecture.md`, `README.md`, and any affected migration or local read-model instructions.
- When adding support for a new dataset domain, update `README.md`, `docs/dataset-loading.md`, `dataset-releases.json`, the relevant API modules/controllers/services, read-model docs, tests, and website/data-repo references in the same feature branch.
- When deployment behavior, Docker Compose files, nginx config, environment variables, GHCR images, migrations, blue/green slot logic, health/readiness checks, or server paths change, update `docs/deployment.md`, `deploy/datasets-api/README.md`, `.env.example`, and deploy scripts together.
- When dataset contribution policy, PR workflow, or public API compatibility expectations change, update `docs/dataset-contribution-policy.md`, `docs/pull-request-workflow.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` when the change is release-visible.

## Local Skills

Read the matching `SKILL.md` before using a local skill.

- `nestjs-best-practices`: use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring NestJS modules, providers, controllers, guards, filters, interceptors, dependency injection, security, or performance-sensitive API code.
- `nodejs-backend-patterns`: use when designing API boundaries, middleware-like flows, authentication/security behavior, database integration, service architecture, external integrations, or operational backend patterns.
- `nodejs-best-practices`: use when making general Node.js decisions around async work, runtime behavior, process/file handling, security, or maintainable service structure.
- `typescript-advanced-types`: use when introducing or simplifying generics, conditional types, mapped types, utility types, strongly typed DTO helpers, or compile-time constraints.
- `zod`: use when defining or refactoring validation schemas, `safeParse` flows, inferred DTO/data types, or validation error handling.
