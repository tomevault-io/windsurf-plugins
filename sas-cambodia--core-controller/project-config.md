# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`core-controller` (package name `core-controller`, previously `@libs/core`) is a lightweight, decorator-based Express + Socket.IO framework: controllers, DI, middleware, and interceptors in the style of NestJS, built directly on `express`/`socket.io`/`reflect-metadata` rather than a full framework. It's published as a library (`dist/` is the build output referenced by `main`/`module`/`types` in package.json).

## Commands

- `npm run build:prod` — compile `src/` to `dist/` using `tsconfig.prod.json` (also runs automatically via the `prepare` script, e.g. on `npm install`/`npm publish`).
- `npm run dev` — watches `src/` and `example/` (`tsconfig.dev.json` compiles `example/` to `dev-build/`), and runs `nodemon` (see `nodemon.json`) which execs `ts-node ./example/app.ts` on change. Use this to manually exercise the framework against the example app while iterating.
- `npm test` — runs `ts-node test/simple-test.ts` directly. There is no test runner/framework (no Jest/Mocha): it's one plain script using Node's `assert`, executed top-to-bottom, testing `Service` from `example/app.ts`. There's no mechanism to run "a single test" other than editing/adding assertions in that file (or running `npx ts-node test/simple-test.ts` directly, which is equivalent to `npm test`).

There is no lint script configured.

## Architecture

The library has three cooperating layers: **decorators** (attach metadata to classes/methods via `reflect-metadata`), a **DI container** (singleton, resolves constructor/property dependencies from that metadata), and `CoreApplication` (reads the metadata at startup to wire real Express routes / Socket.IO namespaces).

### Entry point and module layout

`src/index.ts` re-exports everything consumers use: `./di`, `./enums/http-code`, `./controller`, `./core/factory`, `./http-error-exception`, `./interface`, `./type`. When adding a new public symbol, it must be exported from one of these barrel files or it won't be part of the library's public API.

- `src/di/` — `DiContainer` (singleton at `di-container.ts`) plus the `@Injectable()` and `@Inject()` decorators.
- `src/controller/` — all decorators for defining HTTP/socket controllers (`@Controller`, `@SocketController`, `@Get/@Post/@Put/@Delete/@Patch`, `@SocketEvent`, `@Param`, `@Query`, `@Body`, `@Request`, `@Response`, `@FileUpload`, socket-specific param decorators), plus `util/index.ts` (route-loading and per-request execution logic) and `constant/decorator-key.ts` (the `Symbol` keys all metadata is stored/read under).
- `src/core/factory/` — `ServerFactory.createServer()` returns a `CoreApplication` (`static-server.ts`), which does all controller registration, middleware/interceptor wiring, and server startup. `app-context.ts` and `event-bus.ts` implement a small internal pub/sub (see below).
- `src/interface/` — `Interceptor`, `ErrorInterceptor`, `CoreMiddleware`, `SocketEventAdapter`, `Action`/`Context` contracts that user code implements.
- `src/http-error-exception/` — `HttpError` (statusCode + details, plus an optional `{ bodyOnly: true }` 4th arg — see below), thrown/passed to `next()` to be caught by `ErrorInterceptor`s.
- `src/enums/http-code.ts` — `HttpStatusCode` enum.
- `example/` — a working reference app (`app.ts` + `example/controllers/**`) showing the intended usage; `tsconfig.dev.json` compiles this tree, and `nodemon`/`npm run dev` runs it. Treat this as the closest thing to living documentation/integration test for the framework.

### Decorator metadata flow

Decorators don't execute logic themselves — they call `Reflect.defineMetadata(DECORATOR_KEY.X, value, target[, propertyKey])` to tag classes/methods/params. Later, `CoreApplication` and `executeRoute` (`src/controller/util/index.ts`) read that metadata with `Reflect.getMetadata` to actually build routes and marshal arguments. All metadata keys live in `DECORATOR_KEY` (`src/controller/constant/decorator-key.ts`) — this is the map of "what a decorator writes" ↔ "what the runtime reads", and is the first place to look when tracing how a decorator affects behavior.

`@Injectable()` does one thing: registers the class with the DI `container`. It's optional on interceptors/middleware/not-found-handler classes — none of them are ever resolved through the container (`useGlobalInterceptors`/`useGlobalMiddleware`/`useNotFoundHandler` all `new` the class directly) — their role is instead declared explicitly: `@ResponseInterceptor()` for response-shaping interceptors, structural detection via `catch()` for `ErrorInterceptor`, structural detection via `use()` for `CoreMiddleware`, and simply being passed to `useNotFoundHandler()` for the not-found fallback. `@Inject()` reads the property's design-time type via `reflect-metadata` and replaces the property with a getter that resolves it from the container lazily — this works regardless of whether the *consuming* class itself is `@Injectable()`.

### Startup / request flow (`CoreApplication`, `static-server.ts`)
