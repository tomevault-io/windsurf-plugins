This document defines how AI/code agents should work with this repository: coding style, compiler/interpreter stages, and testing conventions. Follow these rules when generating or editing code here.

## Coding style

- Don't make symbols public unless asked for or needed
- Constructor methods should provide data for all the fields unless there is default initialization
  - Map values should always be initialized to an empty map

- If multiple structs need to hold same set of fields and implement methods on those fields add \*Base struct and use type inclusion on other structs
  - Make this base struct private
  - Implement the relevant methods on the base struct

- Don't add comments explaining each line of code. If you need to add comments to describe a block of statements then you should extract them to
  a function with meaningful name.

- Each bal/go file should have the correct license header

## PAL (Platform Adaptation Layer)

- All platform interactions (e.g. io, http, fs) must go through PAL, not the underlying platform directly.

## Symbols

- IMPORTANT: never store `model.Symbol` as the key in a map, always use a `model.SymbolRef`
- Don't call operations on symbols directly instead call them via compiler context

## Interpreter stages

1. Generate Syntax Tree
2. Generate Abstract syntax tree (AST)
3. Do symbol resolution
4. Do type resolution of top level nodes
5. Do type resolution of inner nodes (function bodies, type narrowing)
6. Semantic analysis
7. Generate Control Flow Graph (CFG)
8. Analyze CFG
   - Reachability analysis
   - Explicit return analysis
9. Desugar AST
10. Generate BIR
11. Interpret generated BIR

Stages 1–10 are the compilation pipeline (source → BIR); stage 11 is the interpreter (BIR execution).

Execution of these stages is defined in `module_context.go` (and `testphases/phases.go` for corpus tests)

### Error handling

Stages 1–4 run sequentially across modules: stages 3–4 are topologically sorted (a module's symbol/type resolution depends on its dependencies' results), while stages 1–2 are unordered per module. If any module reports an error in stages 1–4 (errors are recorded by calling an `*Error` method on the compiler context, e.g. `SemanticError`, `SyntaxError`), the pipeline must stop before stage 5 — no module may proceed to local-node resolution or beyond.

Stages 5–10 then run concurrently per module, with no cross-module dependencies. After stage 10 completes for every module, if any module has errors we must not load any BIR into the runtime: stage 11 (interpretation) is skipped entirely.

## Tests

- IMPORTANT: prefer adding corpus tests over adding unit tests for modules. If you can't write a corpus test to validate a scenario then that means that scenario can't happen in real world

### Corpus layout

- `corpus/bal/` and per-stage golden dirs (`corpus/ast/`, etc.) — compiler pipeline corpus walked by `*/corpus_*_test.go` in each package
- `corpus/*_test.go` (`package corpus`) — end-to-end integration drivers (CLI, extern, package resolution, BIR roundtrip, etc.)
- `corpus/<area>/testdata/` — fixtures for integration drivers (`extern/`, `cli/`, `package-resolution/`, etc.); no Go files in fixture dirs except embedded native modules under test balas

### Corpus tests

- We have 3 kinds of tests indicated by file name in `./corpus/bal`
  1. valid tests (`*-v.bal`)
     These are expected to run end to end and generate output (outputs are indicated with `@output` comments)
  2. error tests (`*-e.bal`)
     These have errors that should be detected before interpreter (error lines are marked with `@error` comments)
  3. panic tests (`*-p.bal`)
     These would trigger runtime panics in the interpreter
  4. future tests (*-f{v|e|p}.bal)
     These are valid tests within the current scope but we have decided not to support. These will trigger unimplemented error at places marked with error markers.

- Name corpus `.bal` files without leading zeros in numeric parts (e.g. `1-e.bal`, `call2-v.bal`, `div1-p.bal`; not `01-e.bal` or `call02-v.bal`). When you add or rename a test, update the matching expected files under `./corpus/$stage` and any `corpus/integration` `.txtar` lines that cite the file name.

- For valid tests for each stage we have expected output defined in `./corpus/$stage` directory. We have corpus tests that generate the actual output and compare against them
  - Each corpus test accepts `-update` flag that will update expected output to match actual output
  - Each corpus tests will run the interpreter up to that stage.
- IMPORTANT: This is the preferred way of testing for any interpreter stage.

- Project test cases ends up in `./corpus/project/` and project names fallow the same convention.

#### Test markers
- `@output`: test cases can write to standard out using `io:println` and use output marker to indicate expected output.
- `@error`: -e test cases should use error markers to indicate lines where an error is expect. Text after marker is purely for commenting, not validated against actual error.
