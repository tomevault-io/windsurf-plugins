## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.
Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up

2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds

3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items

4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git add .beads/issues.jsonl   # Include issue changes
   git commit -m "..." --amend   # Or new commit if needed
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```

5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches

6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed

7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds

- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally

- NEVER say “ready to push when you are” - YOU must push

- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

- Do NOT run `bd sync` - this project uses no-db mode (JSONL is the database)

## title: tbd Workflow
description: Full tbd workflow guide for agents

**`tbd` helps humans and agents ship code with greater speed, quality, and discipline.**

1. **Beads**: Git-native issue tracking (tasks, bugs, features).
   Never lose work across sessions.
   Drop-in replacement for `bd`.
2. **Spec-Driven Workflows**: Plan features → break into beads → implement
   systematically.
3. **Knowledge Injection**: 17+ engineering guidelines (TypeScript, Python, TDD,
   testing, Convex, monorepos) available on demand.
4. **Shortcuts**: Reusable instruction templates for common workflows (code review,
   commits, PRs, cleanup, handoffs).

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=<name>   # Fresh project (--prefix is REQUIRED: 2-8 alphabetic chars recommended. ALWAYS ASK THE USER FOR THE PREFIX; do not guess it)
tbd setup --auto                   # Existing tbd project (prefix already set)
tbd setup --from-beads             # Migration from .beads/ if `bd` has been used
```

## Routine Commands

```bash
tbd --help    # Command reference
tbd status    # Status
tbd doctor    # If there are problems

tbd setup --auto   # Run any time to refresh setup
tbd prime      # Restore full context on tbd after compaction
```

## CRITICAL: You Operate tbd — The User Doesn’t

**You are the tbd operator:** Users talk naturally; you translate their requests to tbd
actions. DO NOT tell users to run tbd commands.
That’s your job.

- **WRONG**: “Run `tbd create` to track this bug”

- **RIGHT**: *(you run `tbd create` yourself and tell the user it’s tracked)*

**Welcoming a user:** When users ask “what is tbd?”
or want help → run `tbd shortcut welcome-user`

## User Request → Agent Action
