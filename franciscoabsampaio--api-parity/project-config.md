# api-parity (project context)

Cross-language API parity tracker. Public-facing intro lives in
[`README.md`](README.md); this file is for AI / agent context.

## What it is

Three packages, each released independently:

- **`api-parity/`** — language-agnostic differ + report renderer
  (CLI: `api-parity compare`). Left-joins two JSON inventories on
  `path`. Distributed as the `api-parity` PyPI package.
- **`api-parity-py/`** — Python plugin. Walker
  (`inspect.getmembers` over a package) + decorators (`@parity`,
  `@parity_impl`, `@parity_ref`). Distributed as `api-parity-py` on
  PyPI.
- **`api-parity-rs/`** — Rust plugin workspace. Two crates:
  `api-parity-rs` (runtime types + serde-gated `dump_to_writer` +
  walker behind a `walker` feature + CLI bin behind the default
  `cli` feature) and `api-parity-rs-macros` (`#[parity]` /
  `#[parity_impl]` proc-macros, kept separate because
  `proc-macro = true` crates can't ship anything else). Both
  crates released to crates.io in lockstep.

## Two orthogonal axes

`kind` is consumer-side, `mode` is producer-side:

|                    | `mode = walker` | `mode = annotation` | `mode = ast` |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| `kind = reference` | **Default.** Public-API walk. | `@parity_ref` decorators. | Parse source, no import. py only. |
| `kind = port`      | Walked surface as implemented. | **Default.** `@parity` / `#[parity]`. | — |

All four (kind, walker/annotation) combos work on both plugins as of
0.0.2. `ast` is `api-parity-py` only, reference only, as of py-0.0.3.

`walker` and `annotation` both load the target; `ast` doesn't, which is
the entire point of it — it exists for targets that can't be loaded at
all (a test suite a distribution doesn't ship) or can't be loaded here
(an import that drags in a dependency graph unrelated to the names being
read). The cost is that only lexically-present names are visible:
inherited members stay with the class that declares them, import-time
construction is invisible, and `kind` follows decorator spelling. It is
a fallback, not a default.

`target` stays the dotted name in every mode; `ast` is selected by
`--from-source PATH`, which says where to read it from instead of
importing it. Module names come from `target`, so a vendored tree keys
to the names it has upstream rather than to its checkout location.

## Wire format

[`SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md) is canonical. Summary:

- Both sides emit
  `{schema_version: 1, kind, language, version, source, entries: [...]}`.
- Reference entries: `{path, kind}` with `kind ∈ {class, method, property, function}`.
- Port entries: `{path, implementation, status, since, issue, comment}`
  with `status ∈ {implemented, partial, unimplemented}`.
- `comment` is port-only and required when `status == unimplemented`.
- Plugin CLI: `api-parity-<plugin> <kind> [--mode …] <target> [-o PATH | -]`.
  Plugins exit 64 with a stderr message on `(kind, mode)` combos that
  aren't yet implemented.

## Status

Shipped: `api-parity` 0.0.3, `api-parity-rs` 0.0.3, `api-parity-py`
0.0.3. All four directions (py↔py, py↔rs, rs↔py, rs↔rs) work
end-to-end. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Roadmap

**`api-parity-ai` plugin.** Natural-language-driven discovery and,
eventually, translation between path schemes (e.g. Rust `::` ↔
Python `.`). Translation should run a heuristic pass first
(substring / casing / module-prefix rewriting), so the model only
handles genuinely ambiguous cases. Produces the same envelopes
everything else does.
