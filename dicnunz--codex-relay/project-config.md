# Agent Notes

- Keep this repo small, local-first, and dependency-light.
- Do not commit `.env`, bot tokens, runtime state, screenshots, or private logs.
- Prefer standard-library Python unless a dependency removes real complexity.
- Test with `python3 -m py_compile codex_relay.py scripts/configure.py`.
- Use `./scripts/doctor.sh` and `./scripts/status.sh` after installer changes.
- Use `./scripts/record_demo.sh` to regenerate the sanitized launch video.
- Do not claim this is an official OpenAI project.
