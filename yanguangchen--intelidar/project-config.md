description: Always use TDD. Write a failing test before production code.

# Test-driven development

InteLiDar is built **test-first**. This is a hard rule.

1. Write a failing test for the behaviour.
2. Run it and confirm it fails for the right reason.
3. Write the smallest production change that passes.
4. Refactor only while tests stay green.
5. Do not implement features, fixes, or refactors without a failing test first. Tests added after the code are not TDD.

Prefer tests on domain logic: scene graph queries, reconstruct state, highlight ids, API adapters. Keep Three.js and HUD layout tests thin.

If Vitest is missing, install it as part of the first test. See docs/development.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and design.md → Test seams.
