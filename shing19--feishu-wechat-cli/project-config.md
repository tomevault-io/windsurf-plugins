# Development Rules

## First Message

If the user did not give you a concrete task in their first message, read README.md, then ask which `command` to work on. Based on the answer, read the relevant files in `docs/`.

## Code Quality

- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing

## Commands

- NEVER run `npm`, run `pnpm` instead
