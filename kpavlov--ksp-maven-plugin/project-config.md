# Info for AI Coding Agents

skill: Kotlin architect
skill: Java + Maven architect

## Development Guidelines

- Use `git mv` command when renaming files to preserve git history, if possible
- Never commit or push changes to git automatically. It should be done manually.
- Ensure new code follows existing code style and design patterns.

### Code Style

#### Kotlin

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use the provided `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting
- Use Kotlin typesafe DSL builders where possible and prioritize fluent builders style over standard builder methods.
  If DSL builders produce less readable code, use standard setter methods.
- Prefer DSL builder style (method with lambda blocks) over constructors, if possible.
- Use Kotlin's `val` for immutable properties and `var` for mutable properties. Consider using `lateinit var` instead of
  nullable types, if possible.
- Use fully qualified imports instead of star imports
- Ensure to preserve backward compatibility when making changes
- Avoid code duplication. Try refactoring to extract common methods/abstractions
- Make code look like it is written by Kotlin/Java Champion

#### Java

- Use the provided `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting
- For Java code, prefer fluent DSL style over standard bean getters and setter methods
- Make code look like it is written by Java Champion
- Write Maven plugin MOJOs in java for maven-plugin-plugin to be able to extract javadoc.

### Testing

- Write comprehensive tests for new features
- **Prioritize test readability**
- Avoid creating too many test methods. If multiple parameters can be tested in one scenario, go for it. Use JUnit5
  `@ParameterizedTest` for such cases.
  Prefer `@ValueSource` or `@CsvSource` over `@MethodSource` if the source is used only once.
  Example:

  ```kotlin
  @ParameterizedTest
  @CsvSource("1.0, 1.0", "2.0, 2.0")
  fun `should test something`(input: String, expected: String) {
      // ...
  }
  ```

  Use `@ValueSource` for single-parameter tests.

- Use function `Names with backticks` for test methods in Kotlin, e.g. "fun `should return 200 OK`()"

- Avoid writing KDocs for tests, keep code self-documenting

- Write Kotlin tests with [Kotest-assertions](https://kotest.io/docs/assertions/assertions.html)
  and [mockk](https://mockk.io/)
  with infix form assertions `shouldBe` instead of `assertEquals`.

- Use Kotest's `withClue("<failure reason>")` to describe failure reasons, but only when the assertion is NOT obvious.
  Remove obvious cases for simplicity.

- If multiple assertions are made against nullable field, first check for null, e.g.:
  `params shouldNotBeNull { params.id shouldBe 1 }`

- Use `assertSoftly(subject) { ... }` to perform multiple assertions. Never use `assertSoftly { }` to verify properties
  of different subjects, or when there is only one assertion per subject. Avoid using `assertSoftly(this) { ... }`

  - When asked to write tests in Java: use JUnit5, Mockito, AssertJ core

### Documentation

- Update README files when adding new features
- Document API changes in the appropriate module's documentation
- Keep documentation concise and straight to the point.
- Always verify that documentation matches the code and is always truthful. Fix discrepancies between code and
  documentation.
- Write tutorial in Markdown format in README.md
- Make sure that in production code interfaces and abstract classes are properly documented. Avoid adding KDocs to
  override functions to avoid verbosity.
- Update KDocs when api is changed.
- When referring classes in KDoc, use references: `[SendMessageRequest]` instead of `SendMessageRequest`.
- Add brief code examples to KDoc
- Add links to specifications, if known. Double-check that the link actual and pointing exactly to the specification.
  Never add broken or not accurate links.
