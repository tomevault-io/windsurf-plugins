# UX & UI Quality

## Excellence by Default

Every change must consider the user experience beyond the basic functional requirement. Prioritize how the interface looks, feels, and responds — not just whether it works.

## Smooth, Consistent Animations

Animations and transitions should be smooth, beautiful, and stylistically consistent across the entire application. Use consistent easing curves and durations so the app feels cohesive. Avoid jarring cuts, instant state swaps, or mismatched motion styles between screens.

## Prefer Reanimated

All animations should use `react-native-reanimated` by default. Reanimated runs animations on the UI thread via worklets, avoiding JS thread bottlenecks and enabling smooth 60fps motion even under load.

Key APIs to use:

- `useSharedValue` for mutable animated values
- `useAnimatedStyle` for styles driven by shared values
- `withTiming`, `withSpring`, `withDelay`, `withSequence`, `withRepeat` for animation composition
- `interpolate` (inside `useAnimatedStyle`) for value mapping
- `cancelAnimation` to stop running animations
- `runOnJS` to call JS-thread functions from animation callbacks
- `Animated.View`, `Animated.Image` etc. imported from `react-native-reanimated`

Do **not** import `Animated` or `Easing` from `react-native`, except in the case noted below.

### Exception: Slow Linear Translations

For **slow, constant-velocity linear animations** such as marquee or ticker scrolling, use React Native's built-in `Animated` API with `useNativeDriver: true` instead of Reanimated. The native driver delegates interpolation directly to the platform's display-synced animation loop (CADisplayLink on iOS, Choreographer on Android), which produces perfectly uniform frame-to-frame deltas. Reanimated's worklet-thread timing introduces micro-jitter at low speeds that is perceptible to users.

Canonical example: `MarqueeText` (`src/components/MarqueeText.tsx`) uses `Animated.timing` + `Animated.loop` from `react-native` for this reason.

## Let Animations Breathe

Give animations and transitions enough time to run and complete so users can perceive what is happening. Do not skip or shortcut visual feedback in favor of speed. The user should always understand the result of their action through motion and visual cues.

Existing patterns that embody this principle:

- **`useTransitionComplete()`** – defer heavy rendering until a navigation transition finishes, preventing janky animations.
- **`minDelay()`** – ensure loading spinners and refresh indicators remain visible long enough for the user to perceive them.
