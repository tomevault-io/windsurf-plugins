# Cursor AI Rules

## Critical Terminal Command Rule
NEVER use exclamation marks (!) in Python code that will be executed in terminal commands.

Examples of what NOT to do:
- `python -c "print('Success!')"`  ❌
- `python -c "print('Error!')"`   ❌

Examples of what TO do:
- `python -c "print('Success')"`   ✅
- `python -c "print('Error')"`     ✅

Reason: Shell interprets ! as history expansion, causing commands to hang or fail.

This rule applies to:
- python -c commands
- Any Python strings in terminal execution
- run_terminal_cmd tool usage

This rule does NOT apply to:
- Python files (.py)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Regular conversation text
