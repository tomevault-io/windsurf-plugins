# Omni-Rewriter conventions

- This repo is an open, model-extensible prompt-expansion framework; H3 and image dialects are
  profiles, not its architectural boundary.
- Prefer schema + deterministic validation + bounded repair over ad-hoc prompt strings.
- Video tasks require `duration_seconds`; image tasks must omit it.
- Tighten H3 rules using `docs/references/jahnson-h3-skill-*.txt` and `docs/h3-pe-harness.md`.
- Keep expand separate from generate. A PE profile does not prove runtime or adapter compatibility.
- Cite public runtime/API evidence and label untested compatibility unverified; do not treat custom
  vLLM forks, stock vLLM, and vLLM-Omni as interchangeable.
- Do not claim to reproduce private MiniMax Context-IR, Seedream internals, or other private
  vendor behavior.
- Keep PRs small, tested (`pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`), and free of full `.mp4` blobs.
- Welcome community contributions listed in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (SFT/RL, adapters, dialects).
