# Pump Launcher — LLM Context

## What This Project Is
A full-stack Solana token launcher for pump.fun. Users configure a token (name, symbol, image, etc.), set up wallets, and launch via Jito bundles. The dashboard provides real-time trade tracking, fee collection, and wallet management.

## First-Time Setup (from a fresh clone)

1. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```
   This installs root, frontend, and backend dependencies in one command.

2. Create the backend environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example backend/.env
   ```

3. Edit `backend/.env` with real values:
   - `FUNDING_PRIVATE_KEY` — Base58 private key of the Solana wallet that funds everything
   - `PRIVATE_KEY` — Same value as FUNDING_PRIVATE_KEY
   - `RPC_ENDPOINT` — A paid Solana RPC (QuickNode, Helius, Triton). The public RPC will get rate-limited
   - `JITO_TIP_LAMPORTS` — Tip for Jito bundles in lamports (default 5000000 = 0.005 SOL)
   - `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` — (Optional) For AI token generation. Get from https://aistudio.google.com

4. Start dev servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend runs at http://localhost:5173, backend at http://localhost:3001.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- `pump-launcher/` — Root with `concurrently` to run both servers
  - `frontend/` — React 19 + Vite SPA
  - `backend/` — Express + TypeScript API server

### Environment
- The ONLY `.env` file is at `backend/.env`. The root has NO `.env`. The backend loads it via `dotenv.config({ path: path.join(__dirname, '../.env') })` in `backend/src/index.ts`.

### Data Storage (all gitignored)
- `backend/keys/wallets.json` — Auto-generated launch wallets (dev, bundle, holder, mint, funding). Private keys stored as plaintext base58.
- `backend/keys/imported-wallets.json` — User-imported wallets. Separate file so they're never affected by bulk operations.
- `backend/data/launches.json` — Launch history records.
- `backend/data/trades.json` — Trade execution records.
- `backend/data/vanity-pool.json` — Generated vanity mint addresses (contain private keys).
- `backend/data/uploads/` — Uploaded token images.

### Backend Services (`backend/src/services/`)
- `vault.ts` — Wallet CRUD for both `wallets.json` and `imported-wallets.json`. Functions: `generateAndStore`, `importKey`, `listImported`, `deleteImported`, `assignToLaunch`, `listAvailable`, `getKeypair`, `getPrivateKey`. All lookups check imported wallets first, then main wallets.
- `launch-executor.ts` — Orchestrates the full launch: generate wallets → fund → upload metadata → create LUT → build Jito bundle → submit → confirm → holder auto-buys.
- `pumpfun.ts` — Pump.fun SDK wrapper. Uses `@pump-fun/pump-sdk` for V2 protocol (Token Extensions).
- `jito.ts` — Jito bundle submission to 5 block engine endpoints with retry and fallback.
- `lut.ts` — Address Lookup Table creation and extension.
- `solana.ts` — Shared Solana connection, balance checks, transfers, transaction execution.
- `pumpportal.ts` — WebSocket connection to pumpportal.fun for real-time trade data.
- `gemini.ts` — Google Gemini API integration for AI token metadata + image generation.
- `vanity.ts` — Multi-threaded vanity address generator with progress tracking.

### Backend Routes (`backend/src/routes/`)
- `launch.ts` — POST /api/launch (execute), GET /api/launch (list), GET /api/launch/:id/stream (SSE)
- `trading.ts` — Buy/sell execution, rapid sell, creator fee collection
- `wallets.ts` — Wallet CRUD, imported wallets, balance refresh, gather, archive
- `ai.ts` — POST /api/ai/generate-token (multipart, accepts optional reference image)
- `vanity.ts` — Pool status, start/stop generator
- `upload.ts` — Image upload for token metadata
- `env.ts` — Read/write backend/.env variables from the UI
- `live-trades.ts` — SSE stream proxying PumpPortal WebSocket data

### Frontend Pages (`frontend/src/pages/`)
- `Launch.tsx` — Token launch form with AI generator, wallet selection, vanity/random mint toggle, bundle/holder config
- `Trading.tsx` — Active trade view with chart, live trades, per-wallet actions, rapid sell
- `Wallets.tsx` — Wallet management with generate, import, balances, fee collection, imported wallet section
- `Settings.tsx` — Environment variable editor

### Key Concepts
- **Funding wallet**: Single wallet that funds all operations. Set via `FUNDING_PRIVATE_KEY` env var.
- **Dev wallet**: Created per launch. Does the initial token buy alongside creation.
- **Bundle wallets (0-5)**: Buy atomically in the same Jito bundle as the token creation.
- **Holder wallets (0-10)**: Buy after launch with configurable delays.
- **Imported wallets**: User-imported wallets stored separately. Can be assigned to any launch slot (dev, bundle, holder) instead of auto-generating.
- **LUT (Address Lookup Table)**: Compresses transaction size. Auto-enabled when 4+ bundle wallets are selected.
- **Vanity addresses**: Mint addresses ending in "pump". Generated by worker threads, stored in a pool, consumed one at a time during launches.
