# Development Instructions for zotero-code-execution

<!-- SKILL-WORKFLOW-START -->
## Skill Development Workflow

This project follows the standardized skill workflow. The skill files are in the `skill/` subfolder, which is symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/zotero-mcp-code/`.

### Important Rules

1. **Only edit files in the `skill/` folder** - Never edit `~/.claude/skills/` directly (it's a symlink to this folder)
2. **Update README.md** if functionality changes
3. **Ask user to review changes** before committing
4. **Commit and push** after user approval (if remote exists)

### File Structure

```
zotero-code-execution/
├── skill/                    # Symlinked to ~/.claude/skills/zotero-mcp-code/
│   └── SKILL.md              # The actual skill definition
├── *.py                      # Python library and scripts
├── README.md                 # GitHub install instructions
└── CLAUDE.md                 # This file - workflow instructions
```

### Before Committing

- [ ] Changes are in `skill/` folder only
- [ ] README.md updated if needed
- [ ] User has reviewed changes
- [ ] Version number updated (if applicable)
