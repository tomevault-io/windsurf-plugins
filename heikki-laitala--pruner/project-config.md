# Pruner

Pre-computed code context engine for AI coding agents. Tree-sitter call graphs + keyword matching, no LLM. Injects relevant files, symbols, and execution paths via Claude Code hook.

## Engineering Principles

### KISS

Prefer straightforward control flow. Keep error paths obvious and localized.

### YAGNI

Do not add interfaces, config keys, or abstractions without a concrete caller. No speculative features.

### DRY (Rule of Three)

Duplicate small local logic when it preserves clarity. Extract shared helpers only after three repeated, stable patterns.

### TDD

Write tests first. Red → Green → Refactor. New features and bug fixes start with a failing test that defines the expected behavior before writing implementation code.

### Secure by Default

Never log secrets or tokens. Validate at system boundaries. Keep network/filesystem/shell scope narrow.

## Validating Changes

When changing scoring, ranking, context output, or anything that affects pruner's suggestions:

1. **Posthoc analysis first** (~5 seconds, no API calls):

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   python3 tests/posthoc_analysis.py tests/ab-tests/sonnet_nest_oneshot_n10_v027_20260406.json --repo /tmp/pruner-bench/nest --pruner ./target/release/pruner
   ```

   Check: did recall improve? Did precision change? Which files are still missed?

2. **Fast A/B test if posthoc looks good** (~15-20 min, ~$1-2):

   ```bash
   python3 tests/ab_test.py --fast --task implement --rounds 5 --save-raw --validate-cache
   ```

   Check: did cost/tools/time improve in real Claude sessions?

3. **Full A/B test for final validation** (~45 min, ~$5):

   ```bash
   python3 tests/ab_test.py --save-raw --validate-cache
   ```

Step 1 replaces a 20+ min A/B test with a 5-second offline check. Only proceed to step 2 when posthoc shows improvement. Step 3 is for release validation only.

The test repos need to be cloned first (the A/B test harness does this automatically, or manually: `git clone https://github.com/nestjs/nest.git /tmp/pruner-bench/nest`).

## Before Committing

Always run lint and tests before creating commits or PRs:

```bash
cargo fmt                      # format code
cargo clippy -- -D warnings    # lint (must pass clean)
cargo test --bin pruner --test integration  # unit + integration tests
```

## Conventions

- **Git**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`). No Co-Authored-By trailer. No "Generated with Claude Code" footer in PR descriptions.
