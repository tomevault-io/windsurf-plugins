# Commit Message Guidelines

## Language
- All commit messages must be written in English.

## Format
- Always use Conventional Commits format.
- Each commit message must start with one of the following types:
  - feat
  - fix
  - refactor
  - chore
  - docs

- Use the format:
  `type: short description`

- Do not omit the commit type prefix.

## Style
- Write commit messages in imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update").
- Do not be overly brief. Include enough detail to clearly explain what was changed and why.
- Prefer specific, meaningful descriptions over short or generic ones.

## Clarity
- A commit message must be understandable without additional context.
- Clearly describe what was changed and why, not just which files were modified.
- Include the purpose or impact of the change when relevant.

## Context Awareness
- Include the affected feature, module, or system (e.g., Copilot, Git, API, UI) when relevant.
- Prefer concrete context over generic terms like "improvements", "changes", or "updates".
- Focus on the actual behavior or functionality affected.

## Good Practices
- Mention the problem being solved or the reason for the change if it is not obvious.
- Provide enough context to understand the change when reading the commit history later.

## What to Avoid
- Avoid vague messages such as:
  - "update stuff"
  - "fix issue"
  - "changes"

- Avoid generic summaries that do not explain what was added, fixed, or improved.

## Fallback Rule
- If unsure about the correct type, use `chore`.
