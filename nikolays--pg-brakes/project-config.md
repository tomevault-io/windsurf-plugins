# CLAUDE.md — engineering principles for pg_brakes

Concise operating rules for everyone (humans and agents) building this repo.
Current product claims are governed by [`capabilities.json`](capabilities.json),
[`ADR-0001`](docs/adr/0001-v0-1-safety-postures.md), and
[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md). The files under [`docs/spec/`](docs/spec/) are frozen
historical design records; they are useful background, but they do not describe
the current supported envelope where the current sources supersede them. The
**process** spec lives in GitHub issue #1 and this file.

---

## 1. Red/green TDD — the failing test comes first, always

- Write the **failing test first**, watch it fail (RED), then make it pass (GREEN).
  Capture both states in the PR (paste the RED output and the GREEN output).
- Every crate and every behavior change ships with at least one real test.
- No production code without a test that motivated it.

## 2. Engineering posture: deterministic floor + fail-closed

- The **deterministic floor** is the safety guarantee: native-role WALL, the
  proxy's Recognized Read Subset and budgets, timeouts, and posture-specific
  write refusal or certification. No model is in that path.
- **Fail closed:** absence of required signal means least privilege; on doubt,
  deny or abort. Production Read disables write tools. Experimental Write is
  non-production and accepts only the tiny Certified Write Envelope in ADR-0001:
  one schema-qualified ordinary table, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, exact equality on
  its catalog-discovered sole `int4` primary key or a non-empty literal key list,
  literal assignments, no primary-key update, no triggers or other excluded
  relation semantics, and full-row pre-images. Rehearsal records the exact key
  set on a checked-distinct operator-provisioned target; signed, expiring,
  single-use approval binds it; apply and revert revalidate catalog identity,
  exact cardinality, and after-image state. Unsupported or uncertain shapes are
  refused before candidate SQL executes.
- The LLM risk-gate is **tighten-only** — it can block/hold/escalate but can **never
  loosen** below the floor. In the MVP the `RiskEngine` is a stub returning `Allow`
  and intent tiers T0–T2 are captured/logged only (SPEC §15.1).

## 3. Roles

- **Manager** (engineering manager): coordinates only — never writes code, tests, or
  reviews personally. Creates issues, dispatches agents, drives the PR lifecycle.
- **Implementer:** picks up one issue in its **own git worktree**, builds it red/green,
  verifies all CI commands locally, opens a **draft PR**, posts evidence. **No self-merge.**
- **Reviewer:** a **different** agent (never the author) reviews every PR by running the
  **real samorev agents** (§4, step 2) — not a generic reviewer merely *told* to "apply samorev" —
  and posts a verdict. Reviews are mandatory.

## 4. PR lifecycle — enforce in order, loop until satisfied

1. **CI green** — all jobs pass on the PR (paste the run link).
2. **samorev review** — run the **actual samorev review agents**
   ([samorev](https://github.com/Tanya301/samorev), checked out locally at `~/github/samorev`,
   Apache-2.0), **not** a generic reviewer merely told to "apply samorev." samorev has **two
   surfaces**: (a) the **Bun CLI `samorev review --fetch`** is a *deterministic* gate that
   checks **CI status + draft state only** and runs **no** AI agents (its
   Security/Bugs/Tests/Guidelines/Docs rows are always `0`); (b) the **`/review-mr` Claude Code
   slash command** runs the **5–6 parallel LLM review agents**. `/review-mr` targets both GitLab
   MRs and GitHub PRs (its posting/report formatting is GitLab-leaning), and the agents
   themselves are provider-agnostic — pg_brakes is on **GitHub**, so the reviewer runs **the
   agents directly** against the GitHub PR diff, each loading its real definition from
   `~/github/samorev/agents/*.md`:
   **security-reviewer** (Opus, **blocking**) · **bug-hunter** (Opus, **blocking**) ·
   **test-analyzer** (Sonnet, non-blocking/configurable) · **guidelines-checker** (Sonnet,
   non-blocking) · **docs-reviewer** (Sonnet, non-blocking). (samorev's optional
   **sqitch-migration-checker** is **N/A** — pg_brakes is Rust with no Sqitch migrations.)
   The **guidelines-checker** loads the project's repo-specific rules — for pg_brakes that is
   **this CLAUDE.md** (there is no separate rules dir to point at). Score each finding with
   samorev's **0–10 confidence** and its three tiers (blocking / non-blocking / potential); a
   finding **blocks merge** when its severity is **CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM** and **confidence ≥ 8**
   (samorev's agent-agnostic `classify_finding` keys on severity + confidence only, never on
   which agent raised it). In practice that means **security-reviewer or bug-hunter**, since the
   other in-scope agents emit mostly lower-severity findings (the optional sqitch checker is
   N/A here).
   - **Omit all SOC2 items — they are NOT relevant to this project** (a single self-hostable
     OSS control plane with no SOC2 scope; samorev's `/review-mr` SOC2 check is optional and we
     leave it **off**). No agent may raise, score, or block on a SOC2 finding.
   - samorev's agents are **LLM-driven and non-deterministic**: take the **union of findings
