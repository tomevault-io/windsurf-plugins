# Tailwind CSS Guidelines

## General Approach
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Follow the mobile-first responsive design approach
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing
- Use semantic color names from the design system

## Class Organization
- Group related utility classes together
- Order classes by: layout, spacing, sizing, typography, colors, effects
- Extract common patterns to component classes when they repeat
- Use the Tailwind merge utility for conditional classes

## Responsive Design
- Start with mobile layout and add responsive variants
- Use the standard breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl
- Be consistent with responsive patterns across components

## Color System
- Use the themed color variables (e.g., bg-primary, text-secondary)
- Follow accessibility guidelines for color contrast
- Use opacity modifiers when needed

## Dark Mode
- Support dark mode with dark: variant classes
- Ensure proper contrast in both light and dark modes

## Custom Components
- Extend Tailwind with component classes for common patterns
- When using ShadCN UI components, follow their styling conventions
