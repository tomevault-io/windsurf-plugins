# Documentation Reference Rule

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before ANY code or design changes, agents MUST reference and follow established documentation.

## Required Documentation Review

### **Pre-Development Checklist**
Before starting ANY task:
- [ ] **Read relevant sections** of `STYLE_GUIDE.md` for UI/design work
- [ ] **Review patterns** in `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` for code architecture
- [ ] **Check existing components** for established patterns
- [ ] **Verify consistency** with current codebase standards

### **Style Guide References (`STYLE_GUIDE.md`)**
**ALWAYS reference for:**
- Color system and role-based coding
- Typography scale and font weights
- Touch screen optimization requirements
- Component patterns and reusable code
- Animation and transition standards
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Accessibility requirements

### **Development Guide References (`DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`)**
**ALWAYS reference for:**
- TypeScript conventions and interface naming
- Component structure and organization
- State management patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
- Error handling standards
- Testing strategies
- Code quality checklist

## Documentation Compliance Process

### **For UI/Design Changes:**
1. **Identify** component type (button, card, input, etc.)
2. **Locate** pattern in Style Guide
3. **Follow** established color, spacing, and sizing standards
4. **Verify** touch screen optimization requirements
5. **Apply** consistent animation and transition patterns

### **For Code Architecture:**
1. **Determine** appropriate component structure from Development Guide
2. **Use** correct TypeScript naming conventions
3. **Implement** proper state management pattern
4. **Add** error handling and performance optimizations
5. **Follow** established file organization

## Reference Requirements

**MANDATORY**: When implementing any feature, agents must:
- **Explicitly reference** which guide section was followed
- **Justify deviations** from established patterns
- **Update documentation** if new patterns are introduced
- **Maintain consistency** with existing codebase

## Pattern Evolution

**IF** a new pattern is needed that doesn't exist in the guides:
1. **Document the need** and rationale
2. **Design pattern** following existing principles
3. **Update appropriate guide** with new pattern
4. **Ensure consistency** across similar components

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE**: Any implementation not referencing or following established documentation will be considered incomplete and must be revised.

This rule ensures the POS system maintains consistency, quality, and professional standards across all development work.
