description: PaneFlow is a Rust workspace with two crates. `src-app/` contains the `paneflow` desktop binary: UI, terminal rendering, pane management, IPC, themes, and bundled helper binaries under `src-app/assets/`. `crates/paneflow-config/` contains the shared config schema, loader, and file watcher logic. Top-level `assets/` holds desktop packaging assets, `scripts/` contains utility scripts, and `tasks/` tracks PRDs and story status files.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
PaneFlow is a Rust workspace with two crates. `src-app/` contains the `paneflow` desktop binary: UI, terminal rendering, pane management, IPC, themes, and bundled helper binaries under `src-app/assets/`. `crates/paneflow-config/` contains the shared config schema, loader, and file watcher logic. Top-level `assets/` holds desktop packaging assets, `scripts/` contains utility scripts, and `tasks/` tracks PRDs and story status files.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run all commands from the repository root.

- `cargo build` builds the workspace.
- `cargo build --release` builds the optimized app binary.
- `cargo run -p paneflow-app` launches the app locally.
- `RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p paneflow-app` runs with structured logging enabled.
- `cargo test --workspace` runs unit and integration tests across both crates.
- `cargo test -p paneflow-app flex_nchild -- --nocapture` runs the GPUI layout tests only.
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` treats lint warnings as errors.
- `cargo fmt --check` verifies formatting.

Compilation depends on local path dependencies for Zed GPUI and the Alacritty fork, so keep those checkouts available before changing build configuration.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use standard Rust formatting with `cargo fmt`; the codebase follows 4-space indentation and Rust defaults. Keep modules and files in `snake_case` (`terminal_element.rs`, `config_writer.rs`), types in `UpperCamelCase`, and functions/tests in `snake_case`. Prefer small, focused modules and brief doc comments where behavior is not obvious. Inline GPUI styling is the established pattern; match existing builder-chain style instead of introducing a separate styling layer.

## Testing Guidelines
Add unit tests alongside the module when logic is self-contained, as in `src-app/src/workspace.rs` and `crates/paneflow-config/src/*.rs`. Keep broader UI/layout checks in `src-app/tests/`. Name tests descriptively, for example `test_three_children_flex_basis`. Run `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo fmt --check` before opening a PR. UI changes should also include manual verification because there is no CI pipeline.

## Pre-commit checks (mandatory)

**Before EVERY `git commit` and EVERY `git push` that touches Rust code, run `cargo fmt --check`.** If it reports a diff, run `cargo fmt`, re-stage, then commit.

This is the cheapest guard against the most expensive CI failure on this repo: the release pipeline runs `cargo fmt --check` on all four Build jobs (Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64) - a single mis-formatted line fails all four legs, skips "Publish GitHub Release", and burns a ~25 min run for nothing. Tag-push releases are extra-painful: a dirty tag commit forces a tag delete + re-create at the fix commit because the original tagged build can't be salvaged. Run `cargo fmt --check` one last time on the exact commit you're about to tag, before `git tag` and `git push origin <tag>`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history uses Conventional Commit-style prefixes plus scope, for example `feat(app): US-004 - adapt paneflow-hook for Codex PID env var` and `chore(tasks): ...`. Follow `type(scope): description`; include the story ID when work maps to a tracked task. PRs should explain user-visible behavior, list validation steps, link the relevant issue or PRD entry, and include screenshots or short recordings for UI changes.

## Configuration Notes
Do not replace the local-path GPUI dependencies with crates.io versions. Linux is the active target; config files live under `~/.config/paneflow/paneflow.json`.

## Cross-platform compatibility (mandatory)

Any new code, refactor, or change that touches the codebase in any way **must** be fully compatible with all three target platforms:

- **Linux** - every major distribution (Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, openSUSE, etc.), both Wayland and X11.
- **macOS (Apple)** - Intel and Apple Silicon.
- **Windows** - Windows 10 and 11 (x64, and ARM64 where applicable).

Always verify every implementation decision against Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility before considering the work done. For Linux, check the behavior against the major distro families and desktop stacks the project targets: Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, openSUSE, Wayland, and X11.

Concretely this means:

- Never hardcode POSIX-only paths, shell commands, env vars, or separators. Use `std::path::PathBuf`, `std::env`, and the `dirs` crate (or equivalent) for all filesystem and environment access.
- Guard platform-specific code with `#[cfg(target_os = "…")]` and always provide a working path for the other two platforms (at minimum a graceful fallback or documented stub).
