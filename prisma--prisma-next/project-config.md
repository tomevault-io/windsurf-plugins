# Import Validation

## Overview

The repository uses a domain/layer/plane package layering architecture with unidirectional dependencies enforced by Dependency Cruiser. The import validation uses data-driven configuration from `architecture.config.json` to validate that packages follow dependency rules.

## Domain/Layer/Plane Structure

Packages are organized by:
- **Domains**: framework (target-agnostic) and target families (sql, document, etc.)
- **Layers**: core → authoring → targets → lanes → runtime → adapters (dependency direction)
- **Planes**: migration (authoring, tooling, targets), runtime (lanes, runtime, adapters), and shared — cross‑plane code and prebuilt artifacts safe for both

Dependencies flow inward (toward core) within a domain:

```
core → authoring → targets → lanes → runtime → adapters
```

## Import Validation Configuration

Dependency Cruiser (`dependency-cruiser.config.mjs`) uses data-driven configuration from `architecture.config.json`:

1. **Package Configs**: Maps package glob patterns to domain/layer/plane
   ```json
   {
     "glob": "packages/framework/core-plan/**",
     "domain": "framework",
     "layer": "core",
     "plane": "shared"
   }
   ```

2. **Layer Order**: Defines dependency direction within domains
   ```json
   {
     "layerOrder": {
       "framework": ["core", "authoring", "tooling", "runtime-core"],
       "sql": ["core", "authoring", "targets", "lanes", "runtime", "adapters"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Rules**: Defines allowed/denied dependency patterns
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       "sameLayer": "allow",
       "downward": "allow",
       "upward": "deny",
       "crossDomain": "denyExceptFramework",
       "migrationToRuntime": "deny",
       "runtimeToMigration": "allowArtifactsOnly"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Plane Rules**: Declarative plane import constraints with exceptions
   ```json
   {
     "planeRules": {
       "shared": {
         "allow": ["shared"],
         "forbid": ["migration", "runtime"],
         "exceptions": []
       },
       "migration": {
         "allow": ["shared", "migration"],
         "forbid": ["runtime"],
         "exceptions": []
       },
       "runtime": {
         "allow": ["shared", "runtime"],
         "forbid": ["migration"],
         "exceptions": []
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Rules

### Same-Layer Imports

Packages in the same layer can import from each other. For example, `orm-lane` can import from `sql-relational-core` (both are in the `lanes` layer).

**✅ CORRECT: Same-layer imports**
```typescript
// packages/sql/lanes/orm-lane/src/orm-builder.ts
import { schema } from '@prisma-next/sql-relational-core/schema';
```

### Cross-Layer Imports

Packages can only import from inner layers (layers closer to core). Outer layers cannot import from inner layers.

**✅ CORRECT: Import from inner layer**
```typescript
// packages/sql/lanes/orm-lane/src/orm-builder.ts (lanes layer)
import { planInvalid } from '@prisma-next/plan'; // core layer - allowed
```

**❌ WRONG: Import from outer layer**
```typescript
// packages/framework/core-plan/src/plan.ts (core layer)
import { sql } from '@prisma-next/sql-lane'; // lanes layer - NOT allowed
```

### Plane Rules and Exceptions

Plane import constraints are defined declaratively in `architecture.config.json` under `planeRules`. Each plane specifies:
- `allow`: List of planes that can be imported from
- `forbid`: List of planes that cannot be imported from
- `exceptions`: Array of glob pattern exceptions with `from`, `to`, and `reason` fields

**Adding Plane Exceptions**:

When a package needs to temporarily import across plane boundaries (e.g., during refactoring), add an exception to the appropriate plane rule in `architecture.config.json`:

```json
{
  "planeRules": {
    "runtime": {
      "allow": ["shared", "runtime"],
      "forbid": ["migration"],
      "exceptions": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Plane exceptions must:
- Include a clear `reason` explaining why the exception exists
- Reference the relevant brief or issue in the reason
- Be removed once the refactoring is complete
- Use glob patterns that match the package paths in `architecture.config.json`

## Adding New Packages

When adding a new package:

1. **Add to `architecture.config.json`**: Add a package config entry with glob pattern, domain, layer, and plane
   ```json
   {
     "glob": "packages/framework/tooling/new-tool/**",
     "domain": "framework",
     "layer": "tooling",
     "plane": "migration"
   }
   ```

2. **Update `tsconfig.base.json`**: Add project references if needed

3. **Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**: Add package glob pattern if needed

4. **Run `pnpm lint:deps`**: Verify no violations

## Running Import Validation

```bash
pnpm lint:deps
```

This command:
- Scans all TypeScript files in `packages/`
- Validates imports against domain/layer/plane rules
- Reports violations with detailed context
- Can be run locally or in CI

## Common Issues

### Package Not Found in Config

If a package is not in `architecture.config.json`, it will be treated as a legacy package (allows all imports). Add it to the config to enforce proper dependency rules.
