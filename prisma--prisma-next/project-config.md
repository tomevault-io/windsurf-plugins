# Git Commit Best Practices

## Never Use `git add -A` or `git add .`

**CRITICAL**: Do not use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git add --all` when staging changes. These commands stage all changes including unrelated or untracked files.

## Correct Approach

Always stage files explicitly:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add path/to/file1.ts path/to/file2.ts

# Stage modified files only (doesn't add untracked files)
git add -u

# Stage files matching a pattern (be specific)
git add packages/1-framework/1-core/*/package.json
```

## Never Amend Pushed Commits

Do not use `git commit --amend` on commits that have already been pushed to the remote. This rewrites history and causes problems for anyone else working with the branch.

Instead, create a new commit with the fix.

## Best Practices

1. **Review before staging**: Run `git status` to see what will be staged
2. **Stage explicitly**: List the specific files or use `-u` for modified files only
3. **Verify before committing**: Run `git diff --cached` to review staged changes
4. **Keep commits focused**: Each commit should contain related changes only
5. **Don't amend pushed commits**: Only amend commits that haven't been pushed yet

## Shell-safe commit messages

When using `git commit -m`, avoid shell interpolation pitfalls:
- Prefer **single quotes** around `-m` message strings.
- Don’t use backticks in commit messages (they can trigger command substitution in some shells).

A good commit:

- Represents one logical step (a coherent unit of change)
- Explains intent ("why"), not just mechanics ("what")
- Is reviewable on its own (small diff, focused scope)
