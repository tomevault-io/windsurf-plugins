description: Capabilities are adapter-reported, contracts declare requirements

# Capability Ownership

**Capabilities describe the database environment and are reported by adapters.** The contract only declares required capabilities in `contract.capabilities` and pins the resulting `profileHash`.

## Do

- Describe capabilities as adapter-reported and negotiated at connect time
- Frame contract capabilities as requirements, not definitions

## Avoid

- Wording that implies the contract owns or defines capabilities
- Treating `sql.*` as a separate “SQL family” capability set rather than shared adapter keys
