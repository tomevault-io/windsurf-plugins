# SQL Types Import Path

**CRITICAL**: SQL-specific contract types (`SqlContract`, `SqlStorage`, `SqlMappings`, etc.) should be imported from `@prisma-next/sql-contract/types` (shared plane package).

## Current Import Strategy

All packages should import SQL contract types from the shared plane:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Import SQL types from sql-contract (shared plane)
import type { SqlContract, SqlStorage, SqlMappings } from '@prisma-next/sql-contract/types';
```

## Package Structure

- **`@prisma-next/contract`**: Core contract types (`ContractBase`, `Source`) and document family types (`DocumentContract`)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-contract`**: SQL-specific contract types (`SqlContract`, `SqlStorage`, `SqlMappings`, `ModelDefinition`, `StorageTable`, `StorageColumn`, etc.) - **canonical source** (shared plane)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-operations`**: SQL-specific operations (`OperationSignature`, `LoweringSpec`, `assembleOperationRegistry`) - **canonical source** (shared plane, see brief 18)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-contract-emitter`**: SQL emitter hook (`sqlTargetFamilyHook`) - **canonical source**
- **`@prisma-next/operations`**: Target-neutral operations (`OperationRegistry`, `ArgSpec`, `ReturnSpec`, `createOperationRegistry`) - **canonical source**

## When to Use Each Package

- **`@prisma-next/contract/types`**: Core contract types (`ContractBase`, `Source`) or document family types (`DocumentContract`)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-contract/types`**: SQL-specific contract types (canonical source, shared plane)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-contract/validators`**: SQL contract validators (shared plane)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-contract/factories`**: SQL contract IR factories (shared plane)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-operations`**: SQL-specific operations (canonical source, shared plane, use directly)
- **`@prisma-next/sql-contract-emitter`**: SQL emitter hook (canonical source, use directly)
- **`@prisma-next/operations`**: Target-neutral operations (canonical source, use directly)

## Migration Notes

- **All packages**: Should import SQL contract types from `@prisma-next/sql-contract/types` (shared plane)
- **Runtime and Lanes**: Can safely import from `@prisma-next/sql-contract/types` as it's in the shared plane
- **Authoring and Emitter**: Import from `@prisma-next/sql-contract/types` for types, `@prisma-next/sql-contract/validators` for validation
- **Test files**: Use `@prisma-next/sql-contract/types` and `@prisma-next/sql-contract/factories` for test fixtures

## Common Mistakes

If you see TypeScript errors like:
- `"@prisma-next/contract/types" has no exported member named 'SqlContract'`
- `Module '"@prisma-next/contract/types"' has no exported member 'SqlStorage'`

This means you're importing SQL types from the wrong package. Change the import to use `@prisma-next/sql-contract/types`.
