# CLI E2E Test Fixture Patterns

This rulecard is intentionally short. For full fixture layout and examples, see `docs/reference/cli-e2e-test-patterns.md`.

## Key points

- Prefer the shared fixture app directory for reliable workspace resolution.
- Tests must clean up their own ephemeral directories.
