# Contract Normalization Responsibilities

## Overview

Contract normalization (setting default values for required fields) has a **single, well-defined responsibility boundary**. This document clarifies where normalization should and should NOT occur.

## The Rule: Normalization Happens Only in the Contract Builder

**The contract builder is the ONLY place where normalization should occur.**

All other components (validators, parsers, emitters) should assume contracts are already normalized.

## Responsibilities

### Contract Builder (`@prisma-next/sql-query/src/contract-builder.ts`)

**Responsibility: Normalization**

The contract builder's `build()` method normalizes contracts by setting default values for all required fields:

- `nullable`: defaults to `false` if not provided
- `uniques`: defaults to `[]` (empty array)
- `indexes`: defaults to `[]` (empty array)
- `foreignKeys`: defaults to `[]` (empty array)
- `relations`: defaults to `{}` (empty object) for both model-level and contract-level
- `extensions`: defaults to `{}` (empty object)
- `capabilities`: defaults to `{}` (empty object)
- `meta`: defaults to `{}` (empty object)
- `sources`: defaults to `{}` (empty object)

**Note**: All `ContractIR` fields are required (non-optional). All fields can be empty objects/arrays, but they must be present. This makes the contract structure highly regular and eliminates conditional branches throughout the codebase.

**When to normalize:**
- When building a contract from the builder API
- The builder should always output a fully normalized contract

**When NOT to normalize:**
- Never normalize in validators, parsers, or emitters

### Contract Validator (`@prisma-next/sql-query/src/contract.ts`)

**Responsibility: Validation Only**

The `validateContract()` function validates that the contract has the correct structure and types. It does NOT normalize the contract.

**What it does:**
- Validates structural shape using Arktype schemas
- Validates logical consistency (FK references, etc.)
- Throws errors if required fields are missing or have incorrect types

**What it does NOT do:**
- Does NOT set default values for missing fields
- Does NOT normalize the contract structure

**Assumption:**
- The contract passed to `validateContract()` must already be normalized (all required fields present)

### Contract Parser/Loader (`@prisma-next/cli/src/load-ts-contract.ts`)

**Responsibility: Parsing Only**

The `loadContractFromTs()` function loads and parses a TypeScript contract file. It does NOT normalize the contract.

**What it does:**
- Loads TypeScript contract file using esbuild
- Validates contract purity (JSON-serializable)
- Returns contract as `ContractIR`

**What it does NOT do:**
- Does NOT normalize the contract structure
- Does NOT set default values for missing fields

**Assumption:**
- The contract should already be normalized if it was built using the contract builder
- If loading a manually-written contract, normalization must happen elsewhere (e.g., in the contract builder)

### Emitter Hook (`@prisma-next/sql-target/src/emitter-hook.ts`)

**Responsibility: Validation and Type Generation Only**

The emitter hook validates contract structure and generates TypeScript type definitions. It does NOT normalize the contract.

**What it does:**
- `validateStructure()`: Validates SQL-specific contract structure
- `generateContractTypes()`: Generates `contract.d.ts` with SQL-specific types
- Throws errors if required fields are missing

**What it does NOT do:**
- Does NOT normalize the contract structure
- Does NOT set default values for missing fields

**Assumption:**
- The contract IR passed to the emitter hook must already be normalized (all required fields present)

### Emitter (`@prisma-next/emitter/src/emitter.ts`)

**Responsibility: Orchestration Only**

The emitter orchestrates validation, canonicalization, and type generation. It does NOT normalize contracts.

**What it does:**
- Orchestrates validation via hooks
- Canonicalizes contract for hashing
- Generates `contract.json` and `contract.d.ts`

**What it does NOT do:**
- Does NOT normalize the contract structure

**Assumption:**
- The contract IR passed to `emit()` must already be normalized (all required fields present)

## Why This Matters

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has one clear responsibility
2. **Predictability**: Normalization happens in one place, making behavior predictable
3. **Testability**: Easier to test normalization logic when it's isolated
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to normalization logic only affect one component

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ WRONG: Normalizing in Validator

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Don't normalize in validateContract()
function validateContract(value: unknown) {
  // Normalizing here violates SRP
  const normalized = {
    ...value,
    storage: {
      tables: Object.fromEntries(
        Object.entries(value.storage.tables).map(([name, table]) => [
          name,
          {
            ...table,
            uniques: table.uniques ?? [],
            indexes: table.indexes ?? [],
            foreignKeys: table.foreignKeys ?? [],
          },
        ]),
      ),
    },
  };
  // Then validate...
}
```

### ❌ WRONG: Normalizing in Parser
