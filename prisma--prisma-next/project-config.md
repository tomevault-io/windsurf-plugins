# includeMany Type Inference Patterns

## Includes Map Pattern

When implementing `includeMany` or similar features that accumulate type information:

**Pattern**: Use a generic type parameter that accumulates include definitions:

```typescript
class SelectBuilderImpl<
  TContract extends SqlContract<SqlStorage>,
  Row = unknown,
  CodecTypes extends Record<string, { output: unknown }> = Record<string, never>,
  Includes extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, never>,  // Accumulates includes
> {
  includeMany<..., AliasName extends string = string>(
    ...
  ): SelectBuilderImpl<..., Includes & { [K in AliasName]: ChildRow }> {
    // Updates Includes map with new include
  }
}
```

**Why**: This allows TypeScript to track include definitions across multiple `includeMany()` calls and infer correct array types in the final result.

## ExtractIncludeType Helper

When looking up types from an accumulated map:

**Pattern**: Use a helper type that safely extracts types:

```typescript
type ExtractIncludeType<
  K extends string,
  Includes extends Record<string, any>,
> = K extends keyof Includes ? Includes[K] : unknown;
```

**Why**: This provides type-safe lookup with a fallback to `unknown` if the key doesn't exist, preventing type errors while maintaining type safety.

## Boolean True for Include References

When using boolean `true` to mark include references in projections:

**Pattern**: Handle `true` in type inference:

```typescript
: P[K] extends true
  ? Array<ExtractIncludeType<K & string, Includes>>
  : ...
```

**Why**: This allows `select({ posts: true })` to infer `Array<ChildShape>` from the `Includes` map, providing type-safe include references.

## Capability Gating

When gating features by capabilities (used by `includeMany` and DML `returning()`):

**Pattern**: Check capabilities at runtime in builder methods:

```typescript
// Runtime check in builder method
returning<const Columns extends readonly ColumnBuilder[]>(
  ...columns: Columns
): InsertBuilder<TContract, CodecTypes, InferReturningRow<Columns>> {
  // Runtime capability check
  const target = this.contract.target;
  const capabilities = this.contract.capabilities;
  if (!capabilities || !capabilities[target]) {
    throw planInvalid('returning() requires returning capability');
  }
  const targetCapabilities = capabilities[target];
  if (targetCapabilities['returning'] !== true) {
    throw planInvalid('returning() requires returning capability to be true');
  }

  // Continue with implementation...
}
```

**For multiple capabilities** (like `includeMany`):
```typescript
// Runtime check
if (targetCapabilities['lateral'] !== true || targetCapabilities['jsonAgg'] !== true) {
  throw planInvalid('includeMany requires lateral and jsonAgg capabilities');
}
```

**Why**: Runtime checks prevent execution errors when capabilities are missing or false. This pattern ensures consistent behavior across all capability-gated features (`includeMany`, DML `returning()`, etc.).
