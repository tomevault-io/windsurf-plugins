# Spec Injection Router

`spec/` + `tasks/` apply to **developing this repo**, not to end-user or shipped-app runtime configuration (see **Repository scope** in `spec/README.md`).

Before implementation, load `spec/README.md` and choose injected specs using its mapping and deterministic rules.

## Required Workflow

1. **Always** inject `spec/verification-integrity.md` first — this is the highest-priority spec and applies unconditionally.
2. **Always** inject `spec/task-artifact-language.md` for task execution records (`tasks/TASK-.../*`).
3. Determine task type:
   - `architecture`, `security`, `sandbox`, `agent`, `commands`, `mcp`, `python-sdk`, `docs-only`, or `mixed`.
4. Build `[Injected Specs]` from `spec/README.md`.
5. Follow all MUST / MUST NOT / CHECKLIST items in each injected spec.
6. If multiple mappings match, inject all matched specs.
7. For any Rust code change, always include `spec/rust-conventions.md` and `spec/testing-policy.md`.
8. If user-visible behavior, env vars, commands, architecture docs, or release matrix change, include `spec/docs-sync.md`.

## Output Convention

At task start, explicitly declare:

```text
[Injected Specs]
- spec/<file-a>.md
- spec/<file-b>.md
...
```

At task end, confirm:

- `spec/verification-integrity.md` checklist was completed (anti-hallucination, anti-false-positive),
- which specs were injected,
- which checklists were completed,
- which verification commands were run (with actual output, not model assertions).
