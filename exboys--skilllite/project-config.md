# Task-Centered Execution Rule

For non-trivial work, use `tasks/` as the source of execution truth.

## Contribution Modes

- External/community contribution (lightweight mode):
  - Task folder is optional.
  - `Task ID: N/A` is allowed for small fixes/docs/issues.
  - Keep PR summary, validation evidence, and regression notes clear.
- Core/maintainer contribution (strict mode):
  - Use full task-centered workflow for non-trivial changes.

## Required Behavior

1. If work spans multiple files/subsystems or requires review traceability:
   - create or reuse a `tasks/TASK-.../` folder.
2. Before implementation starts, ensure design baseline exists:
   - `TASK.md` has scope + acceptance criteria.
   - `PRD.md` is drafted (or explicitly marked `N/A` with reason).
   - `CONTEXT.md` is drafted (or explicitly marked `N/A` with reason).
3. Keep these files updated during execution:
   - `TASK.md` (scope, acceptance, risks, validation, regression scope)
   - `PRD.md` (what/why decisions and requirement changes)
   - `CONTEXT.md` (technical boundaries, constraints, compatibility notes)
   - `STATUS.md` (progress and blockers)
   - `REVIEW.md` (findings and merge readiness)
4. Update `tasks/board.md` whenever status changes.
5. Keep strategic discussion in `todo/*.md`, execution details in `tasks/`.

## Completion Gate

Before declaring work complete:

- acceptance criteria in `TASK.md` are checked or explicitly deferred,
- `PRD.md` and `CONTEXT.md` reflect the implemented reality (or are explicitly `N/A`),
- validation evidence is recorded,
- regression scope is reviewed,
- `tasks/board.md` is updated AND re-read to confirm the status change landed.
