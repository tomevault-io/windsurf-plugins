# Working in this repository

Body Harvest: Recompiled — a static-recompilation PC port of Body Harvest (USA)
(game code `NBHE`, SHA-1 `bbb6666f5014a473747ee4145f036d9fb25d7348`). Read the docs map below before
changing anything you have not touched before.

## Docs map

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `docs/PLAN.md` | phases, gates, standing constraints |
| `docs/findings/phase-NN.md` | the working record per phase, wrong turns included; not rewritten |
| `docs/PORTING.md` | port facts: toolchain, runtime, renderer, patches (symptom first) |
| `docs/GAME-INTERNALS.md` | game facts: addresses, tables, formats, drawing conventions |
| `docs/BUILDING.md` | step-by-step build |
| `docs/issues/NNN-*.md` | one file per visual/behaviour bug, from `docs/issues/TEMPLATE.md` |
| `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md` | short release notes; `CHANGELOG.md` indexes them |

**Update the affected reference doc in the same change that makes it wrong** —
game facts in GAME-INTERNALS.md, port facts in PORTING.md. Record the measurement
and the switch that re-derives it; keep negative results; mark inference as inference.

## Hard rules

- **Never commit game data.** No ROM, ELF, extracted or derived asset. Do not work
  around `.gitignore`.
- **Never edit `RecompiledFuncs/` or `RecompiledPatches/`.** They are generated.
  Changes go in `recomp/*.toml`, `patches/`, or a script in `tools/`.
- **Never hand-edit a submodule** (`lib/`). Every change is an idempotent
  `tools/patch_*.py`, run by `python tools/patch_all.py`.
- **Never change the decompilation** (`lib/bh-decomp`); it is a mirror.
- **One revision only**: every address is tied to SHA-1 `bbb6666f5014a473747ee4145f036d9fb25d7348`.

## Build

| Directory | What |
|---|---|
| `build/` | Windows, clang-cl + Ninja, RelWithDebInfo, `BH_WITH_RUNTIME/RECOMPILED/FRONTEND=ON` (Debug breaks audio timing) |
| `build-linux/` | Linux / WSL (`tools/build_linux.sh`) |
| `lib/N64ModernRuntime/N64Recomp/build-linux/` | N64Recomp + RSPRecomp, built under WSL (`tools/wsl_build_recompiler.sh`) |
| `~/.cache/body-harvest-recomp/decomp` (WSL) | mirror of `lib/bh-decomp` where the decompilation is built |
| `elf/` | `bh.us.elf` (as built), `bh.us.fixed.elf` (what N64Recomp reads) |

Regenerate everything from the dump: `wsl -d Ubuntu -e bash tools/regenerate.sh` (decomp build → `fix_elf.py`
→ `verify_elf.py` → N64Recomp/RSPRecomp, with counts). After a `recomp/*.toml` change only
`wsl -d Ubuntu -e bash tools/recompile.sh`. After a submodule update: `python tools/patch_all.py`.

Test runs: `python tools/test_sandbox.py --exe build/body-harvest-recomp.exe --rom rom.z64 --seconds N
--grab 10,20 --burst 30,60 --out <dir> --seed tools/test-seeds/graphics.json --env BH_INPUT_SCRIPT=...`
(a throwaway copy; `--grab`/`--burst` use PrintWindow, so covered windows photograph correctly).

## Port-specific facts worth knowing first

- **Every call goes through the function lookup** (`use_lookup_for_all_function_calls`): a native
  function registered at a cartridge address replaces the game's for every caller. Wrappers on
  functions inside an overlay must be re-registered from `bh::overlay_loaded` after each load.
- **libultra the runtime owns loses its side effects** (`src/libultra_glue.cpp`): `osContInit` did not
  create `__osEepromTimerQ`; SI completes instantly, which starves lower-priority game threads.
- **Graphics microcode is F3DEX 1.x** (Fast3D numbering), not F3DEX2: `include/bh/gbi_f3dex.h`.
- **Gameplay renders 320×240 by our change** (`setGameplayResolution` → `setFullResolution`); the game
  itself would draw 304×230 and stretch it with the VI scale, which nothing here emulates.

## Environment variables

All port switches use the prefix **`BH_`** (e.g. `BH_INPUT_SCRIPT`,
`BH_AUTOSTART`). A change that could regress on someone else's machine
gets a `BH_NO_...` switch. List them in PORTING.md.

## How to work

- **Land one verified change at a time.** When several mechanisms affect the same
  pixels, change one and confirm it before the next.
- **Verify by running the game**, with scripted input and `tools/capture_frames.py`,
  not only by reading code or grabbing one frame.
- **Timebox investigations.** If a few measurements do not converge, write down
  what was measured and check in.
