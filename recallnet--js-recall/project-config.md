# Organization TypeScript Standards

## Core Requirement
- Use TypeScript for all new code development.

## Code Quality & Style
- **TSDoc:** Maintain comprehensive TSDoc documentation:
  - All public APIs (functions, classes, types, interfaces, variables) must have TSDoc comments.
  - All functions must document parameters (`@param`) and return values (`@returns`).
  - All types, interfaces, and classes must have descriptive comments.
  - Complex algorithms or logic must include detailed explanations within comments.
  - Provide `@example` blocks for non-obvious usage.
  - Aim for near-complete documentation coverage (e.g., target 99% if tooling allows measurement).
- **Type Safety:** Utilize TypeScript's type system effectively. Avoid `any` where possible and prefer specific types.
  - **Explicit Return Types:** All functions must have explicit return types. Never rely on TypeScript's type inference for function returns.
  - **Named Types over Ad-hoc Types:** Prefer creating named types/interfaces over inline type definitions, especially when:
    - The type is used in more than one place
    - The type represents a domain concept
    - The type is complex (objects with multiple properties)
  - Example: ❌ BAD: `function getUser(): { id: string; name: string; email: string }`
  - Example: ✅ GOOD: `interface User { id: string; name: string; email: string }` then `function getUser(): User`
- **Async/Await:** Use `async/await` consistently for asynchronous operations. Handle errors properly using `try...catch` blocks or promise rejection handling.
- **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures and updates, especially when dealing with state management, to avoid side effects.

## Package Development (for Libraries/Shared Code)
- **Modularity:** Keep packages small, focused, and with clear responsibilities.
- **API Design:** Export types for all public APIs to support consumers.
- **Versioning:** Use a standard process (like changesets - see repo-specific rules) for versioning packages.
- **Change Management:** Clearly document breaking changes.
- **Compatibility:** Strive for backward compatibility when making changes.

## Component Development (Primarily for UI/React)
- **Accessibility:** Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error boundaries and user-friendly error states.
- **Typing:** Use TypeScript strictly for props, state, and event handlers.
- **Documentation:** Document component props, usage, and purpose clearly (using TSDoc for exported components).
- **Purity:** Keep components pure (predictable output for given inputs) whenever feasible.

## State Management (Primarily for UI/React)
- **Local State:** Use standard mechanisms like React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`) for local component state.
- **Loading/Error States:** Implement clear loading indicators and handle errors gracefully in the UI.
- **Network Requests:** Cache network requests appropriately to improve performance and reduce redundant calls.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for utilities, helper functions, and isolated logic.
- **Component Tests:** Test UI components in isolation to verify rendering and behavior.
- **Integration Tests:** Implement integration tests to verify interactions between different parts of the system.
- **Scenario Coverage:** Ensure tests cover common use cases, edge cases, and error scenarios.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Include automated accessibility checks in the testing process where possible.

## Performance
- **Optimization:** Be mindful of performance implications. Optimize critical code paths.
- **Bundling:** Utilize techniques like bundle analysis and code splitting to manage application size.
- **Caching:** Implement appropriate caching strategies (client-side and server-side).
- **Asset Optimization:** Optimize images, fonts, and other static assets.

## Code Efficiency Patterns
- **Array Method Selection:**
  - Use `.some()` to check if ANY element matches (stops on first match)
  - Use `.every()` to check if ALL elements match (stops on first non-match)  
  - Use `.find()` to get the first matching element (stops on first match)
  - Avoid `.filter().length === 0` or `.filter().length > 0` when `.some()` or `.every()` would suffice
  - Don't build arrays just to check emptiness or count - use boolean checks where possible

- **Type Narrowing with Early Returns:**
  - Use early returns to narrow types and reduce nesting
  - After null/undefined checks with early returns, TypeScript knows the value is defined
  - Prefer guard clauses at the start of functions over deeply nested if-else blocks
  - Example:
    ```typescript
    // Good: Fail fast with type narrowing
    if (!data) {
      logger.error('No data provided');
      return;
    }
    // TypeScript now knows data is defined for rest of function
    
    // Avoid: Carrying uncertainty through the function
    if (data) {
      // entire function body nested here
    }
    ```

- **Helper Function Extraction:**
  - Extract complex type transformations into well-typed helper functions
  - Use generics in helpers to maintain type safety across different use cases
  - Return discriminated unions or Result types from helpers to make error handling explicit
