# Agent Instructions — Spec-Driven Development with OpenSpec

This repository follows **spec-driven development**: no code is written until the change is captured as an OpenSpec proposal with specs, design, and tasks. OpenSpec is the machinery that enforces this; opencode is the agent that executes it.

## The golden rule

> **Spec → Plan → Code. Never skip a stage.**

If a request arrives as "build X" and there is no OpenSpec change for it, your first move is `/opsx:propose` — not writing code.

## Workflow

The full pipeline runs from requirements to merge. Stages 0–1 are optional for trivial changes; stages 2–6 are mandatory.

0. **Discover** — `/req-capture <topic>` interviews the user and writes `backlog/discovery/<topic>.md`. No invented answers: unknowns go to Open questions.
1. **Tasks** — `/task-generate <topic>` slices the discovery into tasks under `backlog/tasks/`. Alternative entries: `/task-import <key>` normalizes an existing Jira ticket (pasted by the user) into the backlog; `/task-new <title>` creates a single task without a discovery doc. Task IDs ARE Jira keys (`<project_key>-<n>`, provided by the user; `-Dnn` drafts until the issue exists). `/task-enrich <id>` adds edge cases, estimates, and unhappy paths; `/review-task <id>` audits; `/task-jira <id>` exports Jira wiki markup to `backlog/exports/jira/` (not needed for imported tickets).
2. **Propose** — `/opsx:propose <change-name>` creates `openspec/changes/<name>/` with proposal, delta specs, design, and tasks. If the change implements a backlog task, the proposal references its ID and the task frontmatter gets `change: <name>`.
3. **Specify & plan** — Delta specs (requirements + GIVEN/WHEN/THEN) as ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED; `design.md` for the approach; `tasks.md` for checkable steps.
4. **Review** — `/review-change <name>` audits the change before implementation.
5. **Implement** — `/opsx:apply`. **Branch gate (mandatory, BEFORE writing any code):** check the current branch first. Never implement on `main`. With `work_mode: feature`, create and switch to the feature branch (naming rule below) before touching any file. With `work_mode: flexible`, ask the user where to implement — feature branch (recommended) or directly on the integration branch — and create/switch accordingly before the first edit. Then commit with `/git-commit`: conventional commits whose footer traces `Change:`/`Task:` (tasks.md step)/`Jira:` (backlog task id).
6. **Deliver** — feature branch: `/pr-open` creates the PR against the integration branch, `/ship` validates, archives, merges and closes the backlog task. Integration branch: skip `/pr-open`; `/ship` validates, archives and pushes (no PR, no review).

Traceability chain: **Discovery → Task (Jira) → Change → tasks.md step → Commit → PR**. Note: "task" means a backlog/Jira task; tasks.md inside a change holds implementation steps.

## Guided flow

The pipeline is guided: the user should never have to remember what comes next.

- **`/start` is the entry point** — when work begins, it asks which situation applies and routes accordingly: an existing Jira ticket (`/task-import <key>`, user pastes the ticket), no ticket and propose directly (`/opsx:explore` → `/opsx:propose`), or no ticket and the task must exist first (`/req-capture` for initiatives, `/task-new` for a single task).
- **Every pipeline command ends by suggesting the next step** — one concrete command with a one-line reason (e.g. after `/task-enrich`: "next: `/task-jira PROJ-123` to export, or `/opsx:propose` to start building").
- **After implementation work** — whenever `/opsx:apply` finishes a step (or any ad-hoc code edit completes), suggest `/git-commit`. When the last step of `tasks.md` is checked, suggest `/pr-open` (feature branch) or `/ship` (integration branch). After `/ship`, list pending backlog tasks and suggest the highest-priority one.
- **`/next` is the recovery point** — when the user seems lost, returns after a break, or asks "what now?", run the `/next` logic: inspect git state, task frontmatter, and change artifacts, then report where they are and the single best next action.
- Suggestions are advice, not actions: never run the suggested command without the user asking.

## Rules for agents

- `openspec/specs/` is the source of truth for current system behavior. Read it before proposing changes; never edit it directly — it only changes via `/opsx:archive`.
- Requirements use RFC-2119 keywords (MUST/SHALL/SHOULD/MAY). Each requirement has at least one scenario.
- If during implementation you discover the spec was wrong or incomplete, stop, update the spec, then continue. Do not silently diverge.
- Keep changes small: one concern per change, one change per branch.
- Validate before archiving: `openspec validate <change> --strict`.
- `workflow.yaml` at the repo root defines branches, commit convention, and Jira/export settings. Pipeline commands read it; never hardcode branch names or platforms.
- Task frontmatter (`status`, `change`, `id`) is the pipeline state of a backlog task. Commands keep it updated; don't bypass it.
