# Building from source

Simply execute this to build:

```bash
swift build -c release
```

The generated binary will be located at `.build/release/qrgo`.

# Keep rules and README.md up to date

When project structure, dependencies, plugins, or guidelines are changed: check if any AI rules are outdated (in the `ai-rules` folder, ignoring `.generated-ai-rules`) and update them accordingly. If any needed updates, run `ai-rules generate` after modification.

Also check if `README.md` needs any updates.

# Project structure and module organization

## Structure

The project uses Swift Package Manager (SPM) with no external dependencies, relying on native macOS frameworks: `ScreenCaptureKit`, `Vision`, `CoreImage`, and `AppKit`.

- **Sources/qrgo/** - Main source directory
  - **QRGo.swift** - CLI entry point with `@main` struct and device/URL handling logic
  - **Helpers/** - Modular helper classes and utilities:
    - `Shell.swift` - Shell command execution (`ShellResult` struct, static methods)
    - `Colors.swift` - ANSI color codes and print helpers (`printError`, `printSuccess`, etc.)
    - `ScreenCaptureHelper.swift` - Screen region capture via `screencapture`
    - `ScreenCapturePermissionHelper.swift` - Screen recording permission checks
    - `QRCodeDecoder.swift` - QR/barcode detection using Vision framework
    - `SimulatorHelper.swift` - iOS Simulator detection and URL opening via `xcrun simctl`
    - `AndroidEmulatorHelper.swift` - Android device/emulator detection via ADB
- **Package.swift** - SPM manifest (requires macOS 12+, Swift 5.5+)
- **.build/** - Build artifacts (gitignored)

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Types (classes, structs, enums): `PascalCase` (e.g., `ShellResult`, `AndroidEmulatorHelper`)
  - Functions and variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `getBootedSimulator`, `transformUrl`)
  - Static methods: Prefer static methods on enums/classes for utility functions
- **Swift patterns**:
  - Use `@main` struct with async `main()` entry point
  - Leverage Swift 5.5+ async/await where applicable
  - Use `enum` for namespacing static utilities (e.g., `Colors`, `Shell`)
  - Cache expensive lookups with static private variables (e.g., `_cachedAdbPath`)
- **Error handling**: Print colored error messages via `printError()` and exit with non-zero status codes
- **Shell commands**: Use `Shell.runCommand()` or `Shell.runLoginShell()` static methods; check `ShellResult.succeeded`

## Architecture & Design Patterns

- **Modular helpers**: Each helper file handles a specific concern (screen capture, QR decoding, device management)
- **Static utility methods**: Helpers use static methods rather than instance methods
- **Result types**: `ShellResult` struct encapsulates command execution results with `exitCode`, `stdout`, `stderr`, and computed `succeeded` property
- **Color-coded output**: All user-facing messages use `printError`, `printSuccess`, `printWarning`, or `printInfo` for consistent terminal output
- **Platform requirements**: macOS 12.3+ required for `SCShareableContent` API

# Releasing a new version

Versions are tracked solely using Git tags, since the version is not stored in source.

When asked to bump the version or publish a new release, then…

1. Look at existing Git tags, sorted by semantic versions.
2. Take the newest tag, create an incremented version from it considering major, minor, and patch updates; update x, y, and/or z accordingly. If not sure, ask first. Then execute something like this: `git tag -a [new-version] -m "Release [new-version]"`.
3. Push the new tag: `git push origin [new-version]`. CI will handle building and creating a GitHub release from that.
4. A PR will be opened in [block/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/block/homebrew-tap); once approved and merged, the version is released. Instruct the user to watch that repo for the bump PR.
