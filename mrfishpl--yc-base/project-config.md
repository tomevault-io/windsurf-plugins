# yc-base — CLAUDE.md

A **promptable knowledge base of the entire Y Combinator YouTube channel**.
Ask a startup question, get an answer grounded **only** in the corpus, always cited to a
video + timestamp. The repo *is* the knowledge base and the query engine — no database, no
server, no vector store. Git-tracked Markdown is the source of truth; Claude Code is the interface.

## Operating principles (local-first, minimal external API)

- **Do the thinking here, not over an API.** Transcript cleaning, distillation, topic
  synthesis, entity merging, and answering are done by **you (Claude)** directly. Do **not**
  wire in hosted LLM calls (OpenAI/Anthropic/Groq) for these steps.
- **Deterministic work runs as local stdlib-only Python** in `scripts/` (no third-party deps,
  no network): caption cleaning, catalog build, graph build, search, validation.
- **Acquisition is free and local:** `yt-dlp` pulls captions + metadata (`--skip-download`).
- **Transcription backfill is local:** `faster-whisper` runs on this machine for the ~5–10% of
  videos with no usable captions. **Speaker diarization needs a HuggingFace login — do NOT set
  it up; stop and ask the user first** if it's ever wanted.

## System-of-record contract

- **Truth = git-tracked Markdown + YAML frontmatter.** `data/catalog.json`, `kb/graph.json`,
  and any future embeddings are **DERIVED caches**, rebuilt from the Markdown with
  `python3 scripts/build_catalog.py` / `build_graph.py`. Never treat a cache as canonical.
- **`transcripts/raw/**` is IMMUTABLE.** Read it; never edit it. It is provenance.
- **`transcripts/clean/**`** = deterministically cleaned transcripts (produced by
  `scripts/clean_vtt.py`), one file per video, `[mm:ss]` markers preserved.
- **`kb/**`** = the distilled, human-value layer you write: per-video pages, cross-cutting
  topic pages, and entity pages.

## Corpus map (load on demand — don't read it all)

The KB is a browsable tree (all files, no vector DB): **INDEX → topic / series / person → talks**.
Topic and person pages carry a generated "Browse all N talks…" backlink block, so every node links
down to its talks, and every talk links to its exact citations.

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| navigate the whole KB | `kb/INDEX.md` (read FIRST — topics, people, series) |
| all talks in a series | `kb/series/<slug>.md` (startup-school, lightcone, dalton-and-michael, how-to-start-a-startup, talks) |
| which videos exist / mention X | `data/catalog.json` |
| a single talk's thesis + key moments | `kb/talks/<slug>.md` |
| cross-cutting synthesis + all talks on a topic | `kb/topics/<topic>.md` (has "Browse all N talks tagged …") |
| a person + all their talks | `kb/entities/people/<slug>.md` (has "Browse all N talks featuring …") |
| typed relationships / multi-hop | `kb/graph.json` |
| how to search + cite (broad parallel method) | `.claude/skills/answer-from-kb/` |
| where a new page belongs | `RESOLVER.md` (read BEFORE creating any page) |

Regenerate the nav after ingesting: `python3 scripts/build_nav.py && python3 scripts/build_index.py`.

## Hard rules

1. **Read `RESOLVER.md` before CREATING any page.** One primary home per fact; one file per
   entity. Every page's filename is its identity (kebab-case slug).
2. **Search BROADLY before answering — fan out, don't narrow.** The corpus is ~620 talks, so a
   single grep misses things. Launch several `retriever` subagents **in parallel**, each with a
   different lens (topic / keyword / reframe / people / adjacency), then synthesize. Bias toward
   **recall**: over-retrieve and filter rather than miss the best talk. Prefer topic pages for
   synthesis, drill into their backlinked talks for specifics. Keeping search in subagents also
   keeps raw transcript text out of the main context. (Full method: `answer-from-kb` skill.)
3. **Cite every claim** as `[<slug> @ mm:ss]` rendered as a live deep-link
   `https://youtu.be/<video_id>?t=<seconds>`. **Never invent a quote or a timestamp** — copy the
   nearest real `[mm:ss]` from the cited page.
4. **If the corpus does not contain the answer, SAY SO** and name the gap. Never fall back to
   pretraining knowledge to answer a startup question — this KB answers *from YC*, not from you.
5. **Preserve temporal qualifiers** (YC batch, year). Advice can be stale; keep the reader aware.
6. **Contradictions are DATA.** When two talks answer the same question differently, present
   BOTH with citations; never silently pick one. Emit a `contradicts` edge.
7. **Dedup by canonical slug + `aliases`** (e.g. "PG" == "Paul Graham"). If you do a manual task
   two+ times, codify it into a skill.

## Page schema

The frontmatter schema for every `kb/` and `transcripts/clean/` page is defined in
`.claude/rules/kb-pages.md` (path-scoped, loads automatically when you touch those files).
The only OKF-required field is `type`; talks additionally require `resource` (the YouTube URL).

## Workflow skills

- `/ask <question>` — answer a startup question from the corpus, cited.
- `ingest-video` — turn one cleaned transcript into a talk page + updated topic/entity pages.
- `synthesize-topic <topic>` — fold evidence from N talks into one topic page.
- `enrich-entity <slug>` — build/merge a person or company page.
