# React Native Rules for KodMod Mobile App (Cursor IDE)

## Overview
These rules apply when developing the React Native mobile companion app for KodMod, extending the web IDE experience to native mobile platforms.

## React Native Specific Rules

### Performance Optimization
- Use `React.memo` for expensive list items
- Implement `FlatList` for large datasets with `getItemLayout` when possible
- Use `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions()` for heavy operations
- Lazy load screens and components
- Optimize images with appropriate formats and sizes
- Use Flipper for performance profiling

### Platform-Specific Code
- Use `Platform.select()` for platform-specific styling
- Prefer `Platform.OS` checks for logic differences
- Keep platform files organized: `component.ios.tsx`, `component.android.tsx`
- Test on both platforms regularly
- Handle safe area insets properly

### Navigation
- Use React Navigation 6+ with TypeScript
- Define navigation types strictly
- Use deep linking for editor states
- Implement proper back button handling on Android
- Cache navigation state for persistence

### State Management
- Use Zustand for global state (consistent with web version)
- Keep navigation state separate from business logic
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Use React Query for server state management
- Persist critical state to AsyncStorage

### Code Editor Integration
- Use react-native-monaco-editor or similar
- Implement custom syntax highlighting if needed
- Handle keyboard events properly
- Support external keyboards
- Implement code completion and IntelliSense

### Mobile-Specific Features
- Implement haptic feedback for interactions
- Use biometric authentication when available
- Support device rotation and different screen sizes
- Implement proper keyboard avoiding behavior
- Add pull-to-refresh functionality

### Styling Guidelines
- Use StyleSheet.create() for all styles
- Implement consistent spacing using a design system
- Use flexbox for layouts (avoid absolute positioning)
- Support both light and dark themes
- Test on various screen densities

### File System Integration
- Use react-native-fs for file operations
- Implement proper file type associations
- Support importing files from device storage
- Handle file permissions correctly
- Cache files locally for offline editing

### AI Integration on Mobile
- Implement proper loading states for AI requests
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Cache AI responses for offline viewing
- Optimize API calls for mobile networks
- Implement request queuing for poor connections

### Testing Rules
- Write unit tests for utilities and pure functions
- Use React Native Testing Library for component tests
- Implement E2E tests with Detox
- Test on real devices, not just simulators
- Test offline functionality thoroughly

### Security Considerations
- Store sensitive data in Keychain/Keystore
- Validate all inputs from external sources
- Implement certificate pinning for API calls
- Use ProGuard/R8 for Android release builds
- Regular security audits of dependencies

### Accessibility
- Add accessibilityLabel to all interactive elements
- Support screen readers properly
- Implement proper focus management
- Test with TalkBack and VoiceOver
- Provide alternative text for images

### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors to crash reporting service
- Use ESLint with React Native specific rules
- Format code with Prettier consistently

### Build and Deployment
- Use Fastlane for iOS deployment
- Implement proper environment configurations
- Use CodePush for OTA updates
- Automate testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor app performance with analytics

## Component Guidelines

### Screen Components
interface ScreenProps {
navigation: NavigationProp<any>;
route: RouteProp<any>;
}

const EditorScreen: React.FC<ScreenProps> = ({ navigation, route }) => {
// Screen implementation
};

### Custom Hooks
- Prefix custom hooks with "use"
- Keep hooks focused on single responsibility
- Return objects for multiple values
- Use TypeScript for hook parameters and returns
- Test hooks in isolation

### Service Integration
- Create service classes for API interactions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use interceptors for common operations
- Mock services for testing
- Handle authentication token refresh

### Constants and Configuration
- Group related constants together
- Use enums for related string constants
- Make configuration environment-specific
- Document all configuration options
- Validate configuration at startup
