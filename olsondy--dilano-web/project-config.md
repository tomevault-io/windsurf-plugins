## Development Standards & Documentation

> **Mandatory**: All development must strictly adhere to the architecture and conventions defined in the `docs/` directory.

- **Request & Env**: Refer to [API_REQUEST_ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/API_REQUEST_ARCHITECTURE.md) for interceptors and multi-env logic.
- **UI & Theme**: Refer to [UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md](./docs/UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md) for Naive UI and UnoCSS standards.
- **Routing**: Refer to [ROUTING_PERMISSION_MODEL.md](./docs/ROUTING_PERMISSION_MODEL.md) for elegant-router and permission guards.
- **Business Logic**: Refer to [BUSINESS_MODULE_MAP.md](./docs/BUSINESS_MODULE_MAP.md) for directory structure and CRUD patterns.
- **Persistence**: Refer to [STATE_PERSISTENCE_STRATEGY.md](./docs/STATE_PERSISTENCE_STRATEGY.md) for storage and encryption.
- **Deployment**: Refer to [DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS.md) for runtime config and Nginx setups.

## Token Optimization Rules

> **Core Principle**: Minimize unnecessary data transmission; prioritize precise operations.

### File Operations

1. **Precise Read**: Use `view_file` with `StartLine/EndLine` to avoid reading entire large files.
2. **Outline First**: Use `view_file_outline` to understand structure before reading new files.
3. **Symbol Navigation**: Use `view_code_item` to jump directly to known functions/classes.
4. **Precise Search**: Use `grep_search` with `Includes` to scope down results.

### Code Modification

1. **Precise Replace**: Prefer `replace_file_content` to change only the minimum necessary content.
2. **Batch Edits**: Use `multi_replace_file_content` for multiple non-contiguous changes in one go.
3. **Avoid Rewrites**: Do NOT use `write_to_file` to overwrite large existing files.

### Interaction Strategy

1. **Reduce Confirmations**: Execute clear tasks directly without redundant "Are you sure?" checks.
2. **Parallel Tools**: Call independent tools in parallel to reduce turn count.
3. **Concise Output**: Keep responses brief; avoid repeating code or long explanations.

### Context Management

1. **Search on Demand**: Do not pre-load irrelevant files.
2. **Goal Oriented**: Go straight to the target; minimize exploration.
3. **Reuse Knowledge**: Do not re-fetch information already known.
