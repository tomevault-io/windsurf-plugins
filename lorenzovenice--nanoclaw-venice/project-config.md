# NanoClaw (Venice API)

Personal AI assistant powered by Venice AI. Fork of NanoClaw — see [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process that connects to WhatsApp and/or Telegram, routes messages to Claude Agent SDK running in containers (Linux VMs). All inference goes through Venice AI's API via a local translation proxy (`proxy/venice-proxy.ts`). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/whatsapp.ts` | WhatsApp connection, auth, send/receive |
| `src/channels/telegram.ts` | Telegram bot connection, send/receive |
| `proxy/venice-proxy.ts` | Anthropic→OpenAI format proxy for Venice API (connection pooling, diagnostics) |
| `proxy/model-router.ts` | Multi-model routing — classifies requests, picks optimal Venice model |
| `src/fast-path.ts` | Direct Venice API calls for simple chat (bypasses container + SDK) |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent containers with mounts |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |
| `container/skills/agent-browser.md` | Browser automation tool (available to all agents via Bash) |

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update` | Pull upstream NanoClaw changes, merge with customizations, run migrations |
| `/qodo-pr-resolver` | Fetch and fix Qodo PR review issues interactively or in batch |
| `/get-qodo-rules` | Load org- and repo-level coding rules from Qodo before code tasks |

## Venice API & Model Switching

All inference routes through Venice AI via a local proxy:
- **CLI default**: `claude-sonnet-4-6` (switch with `/model` anytime)
- **Agent default**: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Users can switch models by asking the bot (e.g., "switch to opus" or "use glm-5")
- The proxy passes model names straight through to Venice — any Venice model ID works

## Model Switching (for agents)

When a user asks to switch models (e.g., "switch to opus", "use a faster model"):
- Write the desired Venice model ID to `/workspace/group/.venice-model`
- Default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Other options: `claude-opus-4-6`, `zai-org-glm-5`, or any Venice model ID
- The change takes effect on the next message

For advanced multi-model routing, create `/workspace/group/.venice-routing.json`:
```json
{"defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "fastModel": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "powerModel": "claude-opus-4-6"}
```
The proxy automatically routes simple requests (tool acks, short context) to `fastModel` and complex reasoning to `powerModel`.

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload (starts proxy + nanoclaw)
npm run proxy        # Run just the Venice proxy
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start nanoclaw
systemctl --user stop nanoclaw
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.
