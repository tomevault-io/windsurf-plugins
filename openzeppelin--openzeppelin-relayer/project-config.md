# Code Style and Formatting
- Follow official Rust style guidelines using rustfmt (edition = 2021, max_width = 100).
- Follow Rust naming conventions: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants and statics.
- Order imports alphabetically and group by: std, external crates, local crates.
- Include relevant doc comments (///) on public functions, structs, and modules. Use comments for "why", not "what". Avoid redundant doc comments.
- Document lifetime parameters when they're not obvious.

# Safety and Error Handling
- Avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary; justify its use in comments.
- Write idiomatic Rust: Prefer Result over panic, use ? operator for error propagation.
- Avoid unwrap; handle errors explicitly with Result and custom Error types for all async operations.
- Prefer header imports over function-level imports of dependencies.

# Performance and Memory
- Prefer borrowing over cloning when possible.
- Use &str instead of &String for function parameters.
- Use &[T] instead of &Vec<T> for function parameters.
- Avoid unnecessary .clone() calls.
- Use Vec::with_capacity() when size is known in advance.
- Use explicit lifetimes only when necessary; infer where possible.

# Async and Concurrency
- Always use Tokio runtime for async code. Await futures eagerly; avoid blocking calls in async contexts.
- Streams: Use futures::StreamExt for processing streams efficiently.

# Serialization and Data
- Always use serde for JSON serialization/deserialization with #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)].
- Use type aliases for complex types to improve readability.
- Implement common traits (Debug, Clone, PartialEq) where appropriate, using derive macros when possible.
- Implement Display for user-facing types.

# Testing
- Prefer defining traits when implementing services to make mocking and testing easier.
- For tests, prefer existing utils for creating mocks instead of duplicating code.
- Use assert_eq! and assert! macros appropriately.
- Keep tests minimal, deterministic, and fast.

# Logging and Observability
- Use tracing for structured logging, e.g., tracing::info! for request and error logs.

# Code Organization and Clarity
- When optimizing, prefer clarity first, then performance.
- Modularize code to keep functions concise and focused.
- Use derive macros to reduce boilerplate where possible.
