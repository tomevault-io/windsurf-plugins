# Writing frontend tests

Place tests in __tests__ folder in the module, e.g. tests for file `/features/workflows/model/useWorkflows.tsx` should be `/features/workflows/models/__tests__/useWorkflows.test.tsx`

# Running frontend tests

Please run tests with command: npm run test in keep-ui folder
For example: cd keep-ui && npm run test
