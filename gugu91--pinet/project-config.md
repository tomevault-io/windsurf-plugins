# Extensions Repo — Agent Guidelines

Pi extensions for Slack, Neovim, and Neon Postgres.

## Structure

```
extensions/
├── slack-bridge/    # Pinet — Slack assistant integration (workspace)
├── nvim-bridge/     # Neovim bridge; PiComms disabled pending Pinet adapter
├── neon-psql/       # Neon Postgres CLI (workspace)
├── types/           # Shared type declarations (workspace)
├── plans/           # Architecture docs
├── .pi/             # Pi config (skills, agents)
├── turbo.json       # Turborepo task orchestration
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm lint          # Oxlint across all extensions (turbo-cached)
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript strict check (turbo-cached)
pnpm test          # Vitest — all tests (turbo-cached)
pnpm prepush       # lint + typecheck + test (runs on git push)
pnpm format        # Prettier + Stylua
```

Turbo caches lint/typecheck/test results per-package. Unchanged packages
are skipped on re-runs.

## Worktree rules

- NEVER work directly on `main` or checkout feature branches in the main repo directory.
- ALWAYS create a git worktree: `git worktree add .worktrees/<name> -b <branch>` and `cd` into it before making changes.
- In a fresh worktree, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` before `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, or `pnpm prepush`. Dependency bootstrap is per checkout/worktree, not a one-time repo setup step.
- If you are already in a worktree, stay there. Do not `cd` back to the main checkout.
- When your PR is merged, clean up: `git worktree remove .worktrees/<name>` from the main checkout.
- NEVER run `git checkout <branch>` or `git switch <branch>` in the main repo checkout. It must always be on `main`.

## Development workflow

1. **Branch** from `main` — use `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/` prefixes
2. **Write tests** for any new logic — extract pure functions into `helpers.ts` files and test them
3. **Check locally**: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`
4. **Create a PR** — base on `main` (or stack on a feature branch)
5. **Request review** — use the `code-reviewer` subagent (see below)
6. **Address feedback**, then merge

## Code review

Always request a review before merging:

```
Use the code-reviewer subagent to review PR #N
```

The reviewer posts findings to PiComms and GitHub. Fix any critical/warning issues before merging.

## Testing

- Test runner: **Vitest**
- Tests live next to source: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`
- Extract testable logic into `helpers.ts` — keep `index.ts` for extension wiring
- Tests run on **pre-push** hook (via husky)
- Use temp directories for filesystem tests, clean up in `afterEach`
- Per-package test scripts run via Turborepo

## Conventions

- **Zero npm runtime deps** — use native Node.js APIs (`node:fs`, `node:sqlite`, `fetch`, `WebSocket`)
- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no implicit returns
- **Prettier** for formatting (auto-runs via lint-staged on commit)
- **Oxlint** for TypeScript linting
- Config in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` under extension name key
- Env vars as fallback for secrets

## Agent coding standards

Treat review feedback as repo-owned guardrails, not one-off fixes. When an
agent or reviewer catches a repeatable issue, prefer a cheap deterministic lint,
test, or CI check so the next agent gets the correction before review.

- **Write decisive code.** Prefer clear invariants over defensive branches,
  catches, comments, and tests for states the system does not permit. Catch only
  where failure changes ownership or retry behaviour. Every regression test must
  fail against the bug or a plausible mutation; otherwise remove it.
- **Parse boundaries, do not spread `unknown`.** External, serialized, config,
  JSON, Slack, Pinet, and MCP-shaped values must be parsed at the boundary into a
  named DTO or domain type. The diff-aware `lint:agent-standards` check prevents
  net-new explicit `unknown` and `any` type escape hatches in changed TypeScript.
- **No `isRecord`.** Generic record guards hide the real boundary. The agent
  standards lint bans new functions and variables named `isRecord`; parse the
  boundary first, then use a domain-specific parser/type guard only if one is
  still needed.
- **Inline one-use helpers.** A helper with one call site usually costs more
  context than it saves. The agent standards lint flags newly added local
  top-level helpers with one call site. Keep one only when it is a real semantic
  seam and add `agent-standards-ignore prefer-inline-single-use-helper: <reason>`
  immediately above it.
- **No explicit `any`.** Oxlint's `typescript/no-explicit-any` is an error. In the
  rare generic-type-system escape hatch where `any` is the precise TypeScript
  tool, keep it tiny, tested, and locally documented.

## GitHub

- Remote: `github.com:gugu91/pinet.git`
- Auth: `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user gugu91)` prefix for `gh` commands
- Create PRs with `gh pr create`
- Merge with `gh pr merge`
- npm publish readiness lives in `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` and `plans/npm-publish.md`. Do not run real publishes, tag, or bump versions without explicit maintainer release approval.

## Extension patterns

Design every extension with token-efficient progressive discovery. This is
