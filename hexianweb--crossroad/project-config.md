## Three.js Development Guidelines

### Scene Management
- Keep scene graph hierarchy clean and optimized
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Implement proper cleanup methods for disposed objects
- Group related meshes using Object3D for better organization
- Use meaningful names for all scene objects

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize draw calls by using geometry instancing where appropriate
- Implement proper level of detail (LOD) for complex models
- Use texture atlases when possible to reduce texture switches
- Implement frustum culling for off-screen objects
- Cache frequently accessed values and objects
- Use BufferGeometry instead of Geometry
- Optimize shader complexity based on target devices

### Resource Management
- Implement proper asset loading and management
- Use TextureLoader for efficient texture loading
- Implement proper error handling for failed loads
- Use DRACO compression for complex geometries
- Properly dispose of materials, geometries, and textures

### Animation
- Use the Animation System efficiently
- Implement proper animation mixing and transitions
- Use skeletal animation when appropriate
- Optimize animation data for performance
- Implement proper animation cleanup

### Camera Controls
- Implement smooth camera transitions
- Set appropriate near/far planes
- Use proper camera projection for the scene
- Implement proper camera collision detection if needed
- Handle camera aspect ratio changes properly

### Rendering
- Use appropriate renderer settings for the target platform
- Implement proper post-processing pipeline
- Use appropriate shadow mapping techniques
- Implement proper anti-aliasing strategy
- Handle window resize events properly

### Debug & Development
- Use Stats.js for performance monitoring
- Implement proper debug views
- Use proper logging for WebGL warnings
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use appropriate development tools (OrbitControls, etc.)
