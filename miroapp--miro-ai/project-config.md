Miro AI Developer Tools - A plugin/integration repository connecting AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Kiro, and other MCP clients) to Miro boards. This is primarily a **documentation and configuration repository** - not a traditional compiled codebase.

# CRITICAL

- NO code without vendor documentation check first.
- Make sure you understand how Claude Code plugins work by reading the relevant MCP documentation.
- Reduce the level of verbosity in your response to be concise and to the point.
- You must provide clear, direct answers and avoid unnecessary explanations or elaborations.
- Use diagrams, tables, or bullet points to explain.
- Provide working code and references to it instead of code snippets.
- Keep architecture implementation simple, concise, performant, and modular.
- Use conventional commits
