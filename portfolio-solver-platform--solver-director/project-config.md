# Claude Code Documentation - solver-director

## Project Overview
This is a Flask-based microservice called "solver-director" designed to manage different solver-controllers. It's containerized with Docker and deployable to Kubernetes using Helm charts with Skaffold for development workflow automation.

## Repository Structure

```

## Key Components

### Container Configuration (`Dockerfile`)
- Base: `python:3.13-slim`
- Security: Non-root user (uid 10001), optimized for production
- Exposed port: 8080
- Python environment variables for optimization

### Kubernetes Deployment (`helm/`)
- **Chart**: solver-director v0.1.0
- **Security**: Comprehensive security context with non-root, read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities
- **Scaling**: HPA with 1-10 replicas based on 70% CPU utilization
- **Resources**: 200m-1000m CPU, 256Mi-2Gi memory
- **Probes**: Liveness (30s delay) and readiness (5s delay) on `/` endpoint
- **Service**: ClusterIP on port 8080
- **PDB**: Max 1 unavailable pod
- **Rolling updates**: 0 unavailable, 1 max surge

## Development Workflow

### Available Commands
```bash
# Development (local Kubernetes)
skaffold dev                    # Build, deploy, and watch for changes

# Staging
skaffold run -p staging        # Deploy to staging environment

# Production
skaffold run -p prod           # Deploy to production environment

```

### Skaffold Profiles
- **dev**: Local development with port forwarding (localhost:8080), no image push
- **staging**: Staging deployment with production values, local build
- **prod**: Production deployment with image push enabled

## Environment Requirements
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (local or remote)
- Skaffold (`/usr/local/bin/skaffold`)
- Helm (`/usr/local/bin/helm`)
- Python 3.13+ (for local development)


## Notes for Claude
- This is a microservice architecture component
- Focus on Flask web development patterns
- Kubernetes-native deployment approach
- Security-first container and deployment configuration
- Development workflow optimized with Skaffold for rapid iteration%
