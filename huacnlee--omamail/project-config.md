# Repository working agreements

## Colors

- Use colors from the active Omarchy system theme. Do not hard-code UI colors.
- Pass semantic colors down from `App.qml` as required component properties so
  a theme change propagates through every view.
- Derive muted, hover, and selected variants from an inherited color with
  alpha, or from `Style.normalFillFor` / `hoverFillFor` / `selectedFillFor`.
  Do not introduce literal fallback grays.
- Secondary text mixes the foreground toward the **background**, not
  `Qt.darker`. On a light theme, darkening an almost-black foreground makes
  "secondary" text heavier than body text — the opposite of what it means.
- `tests/test_source.sh` enforces the no-literal-colors rule. Keep it updated
  rather than working around it.

## JavaScript libraries

- Files at the repository root ending in `.js` are read by the QML engine.
  They start with `.pragma library` and use `var` and `function` only — no
  `const`, `let`, arrow functions, or template literals.
- Everything that parses, formats, or decides lives in one of them, so the node
  tests can reach it without a compositor. QML holds no logic worth testing.

## Entry points

- `Service.qml` is constructed by the shell itself, which injects only `shell`,
  `manifest`, `pluginRegistry`, and `barWidgetRegistry`. It must declare **no**
  required properties: one the shell does not know about makes the whole plugin
  fail to instantiate, with the reason buried in a console warning.
- Plugin settings reach the service from the bar widget via `applySettings`,
  because the shell hands settings to the widget rather than to the service.

## UI labels

- Suffix button and menu labels with `...` when activating them opens a dialog,
  a page, a browser, or a terminal workflow instead of completing the action
  immediately.
- Never let colour alone carry state. Unread is a dot, a heavier weight, and a
  brighter subject, because some themes put the accent close to the foreground.
- Prefer the shorter label when both are honest, but never buy brevity with
  accuracy: "Mark these read" acts on the messages that are loaded, so it does
  not claim to mark all of them.

## Popups and their triggers

- A control that opens a popup holds a selected style for as long as that popup
  is on screen. A trigger that looks untouched while its own menu is up leaves
  the menu looking unattached to anything, and leaves the user without an answer
  to "which of these opened it".
- Anchor a popup to the trigger's own edge, not to the pointer. `mapToGlobal(0, 0)`
  on the control, never the click position: the menu should land in the same
  place however the control was pressed.
- Place a popup *after* it opens, and again whenever its height changes. A
  `QQC.Popup` does not build its contents until the first `open()`, so its
  height is still zero while any placement code is deciding whether it fits —
  the first open lands somewhere different from every one after it, which is the
  bug this rule exists to prevent.
- A popup that would overflow flips to the other side of its trigger, then
  clamps to the window edge, then clamps to zero. All three, in that order.

## Secrets

- Refresh tokens go to GNOME Keyring over stdin, never through a command line.
- The OAuth client goes to a 0600 file, never to plugin settings: `shell.json`
  is world-readable.
- Anything that could carry a credential passes through `OAuth.redact` before
  it can reach a label.
- Remote images in a message body are blocked until the reader asks for them.
  Qt's rich text engine really does fetch them, so rendering one fires every
  tracking pixel in the message.

## Verification

- Run `make validate` after any QML or behavior change. It runs the node tests,
  the source regressions, `qmllint`, and `omarchy plugin validate`.
- `qmllint` cannot resolve `qs.Ui` / `qs.Commons` and reports unresolved-import
  warnings for every plugin, including the shell's own. The exit code is the
  gate, not the warning count.
