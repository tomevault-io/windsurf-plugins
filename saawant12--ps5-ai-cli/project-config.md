# Repository instructions

## Public documentation and privacy

Treat this repository as public. All documentation and Markdown intended for
the repository, including README files and this file, must be safe to publish.

- Never include private information from the user, conversations, the local
  environment, or connected devices in public documentation or Markdown.
- Never include credentials, tokens, account details, personal information,
  private network addresses, machine identifiers, absolute local workspace
  paths, or unredacted diagnostic logs. Use generic placeholders such as
  `PS5_IP` and `/path/to/project` where configuration examples are necessary.
- Never commit task lists, internal plans, investigation notes, session history,
  or private progress reports. Keep task tracking in ignored local storage;
  never copy it into or link to it from public docs.
- Document public product behavior, verified compatibility, build/install
  instructions, and user-facing limitations without exposing private context.
- Before finalizing any documentation change or preparing a commit, inspect
  the content and proposed Git changes for private information and task notes.
  Confirm local task files and diagnostics remain ignored and unstaged.
