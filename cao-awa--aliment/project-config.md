# Aliment

Fabric mod for Minecraft 26.3 (Scala 3.9 / Kotlin 2.4 / Java 25). See `SPOILER.md`, `PHYSIOLOGY.md`, and
`TECHNICAL.md` for the content and architecture documentation, and `tools/README.md` for asset generators and dev self tests.

## Languages: where code goes

The mod is deliberately split by language, and the build enforces the direction
(`src/main/scala` -> `src/main/kotlin` -> `src/main/java` -> `src/client`):

| Language | Lives in | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scala 3** | `src/main/scala`, package `...aliment.physiology.model` | **Every number and every calculation.** The per-tick model, the steady states, the mineral reference ranges, the derived symptom magnitudes. |
| Kotlin | `src/main/kotlin` | Minecraft glue: Fabric attachments and codecs, mob effects, events, the command, the tick handler - and the storage value types (`AlimentData`, `Mediators`, `Electrolytes`, `TraceElements`, `Mineral`). |
| **Java** | `src/main/java/.../physiology/AlimentModelBridge.java` | **The seam to the model.** The one file allowed to mention a Scala type: converts Kotlin state to and from `ModelState`, forwards every operation and magnitude, re-exports the numbers. |
| Java | `src/main/java`, `src/client/java` | Mixins, because Loom's annotation processor and the compiler check the targets. |
| Kotlin | `src/client/kotlin` | Client-only rendering and HUD. |

**Write new numerical or steady-state code in Scala, in `src/main/scala`.** Rules that keep this
workable:

* The model is a **pure function of numbers**: it must not import Minecraft, Kotlin, Fabric or
  anything under `src/main/kotlin`. It compiles first, and that is why it cannot.
* **No Kotlin file may name a Scala type** - not in a signature, not in a body, not in a KDoc link.
  K2 resolves a Scala class by also loading its supertypes, so a Kotlin file that merely mentions
  `Mineral` drags in `scala.Product` and IntelliJ reports `Cannot access 'scala.Product' which is a
  supertype of 'Mineral'`, however the classpath is wired. That is why Kotlin has its own
  `AlimentData`/`Mediators`/`Electrolytes`/`TraceElements`/`Mineral`, and why every call crosses
  through `AlimentModelBridge`. The grep that checks it: any hit for `physiology.model` under
  `src/main/kotlin`, or for one of the model's names (`ModelState`, `ModelConstants`, `ModelMineral`,
  `ModelMediators`, `ModelElectrolytes`, `ModelTraceElements`, `ModelDrugs`, `MineralRanges`, `MediatorLevels`,
  `ElectrolyteDefaults`, `TraceElementDefaults`, `DrugDefaults`, `Physiology.`), is a bug.
* `AlimentModelBridge` must not put a Scala type in a **public** field, parameter or return type
  either: Kotlin resolves those eagerly, even though it resolves the Java file's private fields and
  method bodies lazily (verified: a private field of a nonexistent type does not break
  `compileKotlin`). Scala types are private fields and bodies only.
* Nothing in the bridge may contain a number or a threshold. If a value is needed on both sides it
  is added to the model and re-exported through `AlimentModelBridge` under the name Kotlin uses.
* The model compiles in its own task, `compileModelScala`, and **not** through the Scala plugin's
  `compileScala`. That task unconditionally depends on `compileJava` (joint Java/Scala compilation),
  which would close the cycle `compileJava -> compileKotlin -> compileScala -> compileJava`; the
  dependency survives the source set having no Java at all, and clearing it from `dependsOn` does not
  stick because the plugin re-adds it when the task is realised. A hand-made `ScalaCompile` task
  needs four things the plugin normally supplies by convention: `incrementalOptions.analysisFile`,
  `incrementalOptions.classfileBackupDir`, `targetCompatibility`, and `javaLauncher`. The plugin's
  own `compileScala` is left with no sources so nothing is compiled twice.
* The model's output reaches everything downstream as a plain file dependency
  (`files(compileModelScala)` on the main and client classpaths, plus `tasks.jar { from(scalaClasses) }`),
  never as `libraries.from(model.output)` or `compileClasspath += <another source set>.output`.
  IntelliJ turns those into a dependency on another *module* and then resolves Scala types out of
  that module's sources as light classes.
* Kotlin cannot use named arguments on Java methods, and Java has no default arguments, so
  `AlimentPhysiology` keeps the old call sites working: it is a thin Kotlin facade over the bridge
  that restores the defaults (`tick(data)`, `drink(data)`, `seed(data, bacteria = 4f)`).
* If a Scala type needs a `@BeanProperty` getter for Java to read a field, it needs one - the bridge
  reads `state.getBacteria()`, not `state.bacteria()`.
* **The model's names never collide with Kotlin's.** Its case classes are `ModelMineral`,
  `ModelMediators`, `ModelElectrolytes`, `ModelTraceElements`, `ModelDrugs` and `ModelState`, and its constants
  live in *separately named* objects rather than in companions - `MineralRanges`, `MediatorLevels`,
  `ElectrolyteDefaults`, `TraceElementDefaults`, `DrugDefaults`, `ModelConstants` - so that a Java file can
  `import ...physiology.model.*` and refer to every one of them by its short name. That is also why
