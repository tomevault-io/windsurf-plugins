### Interaction Relationships and Call Flow

The entire process is a clear **Sequential Pipeline**, orchestrated by the `project-orchestrator`:

1.  **Start:**
    * **User** ==>  `project-orchestrator`: Submit raw data and analysis requirements.

2.  **Phase 1: Data Preparation**
    * `project-orchestrator`  ==>  `data-engineer`: "Please process this raw data."
    * `data-engineer`  ==>  `project-orchestrator`: Return clean datasets and processing logs.

3.  **Phase 2: Exploration & Insights**
    * `project-orchestrator`  ==>  `data-analyst-eda`: "Please perform exploratory analysis on this clean data."
    * `data-analyst-eda`  ==>  `project-orchestrator`: Return EDA reports, charts, and preliminary insights.

4.  **Phase 3: Modeling & Prediction**
    * `project-orchestrator`  ==>  `ml-model-scientist`: "Based on this data and preliminary insights, please build predictive models, identify key parameters and optimal ranges."
    * `ml-model-scientist`  ==>  `project-orchestrator`: Return model results, key parameter lists, and optimal range analysis.

5.  **Phase 4: Integration & Delivery**
    * `project-orchestrator`  ==>  `technical-writer-qa`: "Please integrate all outputs into final reports and Notebooks, and perform quality assurance."
    * `technical-writer-qa`  ==>  `project-orchestrator`: Return final `.md` reports and `.ipynb` files.

6.  **End:**
    * `project-orchestrator`  ==>  **User**: Deliver final deliverables.

### Workspace Environment Data Architecture Blueprint
#### Core Design Principles

1.  **Project Isolation:** Each new analysis request should be an independent project folder to avoid cross-contamination.
2.  **Separation of Concerns:** Raw data, processed data, code, reports, models, etc., should be stored separately by category.
3.  **Immutability of Raw Data:** Once content is placed in the raw data folder `raw`, it should never be modified by any program, ensuring traceability of analysis.
4.  **Process-Oriented:** Folder numbering (00, 01, 02...) reflects the main data processing workflow.

#### Directory Structure Blueprint

This is the standard structure that the `Project Lead` Agent should initialize when receiving a new analysis project (e.g., `project_sales_prediction`).

### Python Execution Environment

- Python 3.12 via pyenv (`python3`)
- Jupyter available via pyenv (`jupyter`)
- Core libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Run a script: `python3 <script.py>`
Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`

### Important Notes
- project-orchestrator is only responsible for planning, not for generating and executing code, only responsible for planning and then assigning tasks to other subagents
- Do not use plt.show(), but directly save charts as files, such as using plt.savefig()
- final_report.md can include images from 03_reports/figures with explanations
