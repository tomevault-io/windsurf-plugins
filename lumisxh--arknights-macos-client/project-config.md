# Agent Instructions

## Scope

- Build only for Apple Silicon and macOS 26 or newer.
- Support only the official Global PC client; do not add CN behavior without a verified API and an explicit decision.
- Keep source code, UI copy, documentation, commits, and tests in English.
- Use SwiftPM as the source of truth; do not add an Xcode project.
- Do not commit Arknights binaries, game files, downloaded artwork, Wine runtimes, or files from `dist/`.

## Commands

| Task          | Command        |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Source checks | `just check`   |
| Full CI       | `just ci`      |
| Run launcher  | `just run`     |
| UI preview    | `just preview` |
| App bundle    | `just app`     |
| Dev runtime   | `just runtime` |
| App + runtime | `just dev`     |
| DMG + runtime | `just dev-dmg` |
| App icon      | `just icon`    |

## Key Conventions

- Use tabs with a width of four in Swift files; follow `.swift-format`.
- Keep SwiftUI views in `UI`, state and user actions in `ViewModels`, external work in `Services` or `Runtime`, and persisted paths in `Storage`.
- Keep handwritten Swift files below 350 lines; split cohesive behavior into focused types or extensions.
- Keep UI state changes on `@MainActor`; move long synchronous network, hashing, extraction, and file work off it.
- Treat game installation as an exclusive operation. A refresh, Settings action, or repeated click must never start another installer or overwrite active progress.
- Preserve resumable `.part` downloads and validate every manifest path before writing it.
- Use standard macOS storage locations through `AppPaths`; do not introduce repository-local or legacy migration paths without an explicit requirement.
- Keep the interface native to macOS while following `docs/design.md`; branding may be angular, but primary actions use native controls.
- Add focused tests for changed installer, updater, storage, parsing, or concurrency behavior.
- Record user-visible changes in the next release section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Preserve MPL-2.0 SPDX headers in handwritten Swift, C, and Python source files.
- Regenerate `Resources/AppIcon.icns` and `Resources/Assets.car` with `just icon`; do not edit them directly.
- Unless explicitly requested, do not install, launch, download, uninstall, or alter a user's local game while verifying changes.

## Release Rules

- Releases are manual draft releases triggered with an `X.Y.Z` version.
- Trigger releases only from clean, pushed `main`; the version must match `CHANGELOG.md` and `Resources/Info.plist`.
- Never replace a published tag or release asset; issue a higher version for fixes.
- Keep the prefix revision, tested runtime versions, provenance, URLs, and SHA-256 values in `runtime.json`. Increase `prefixRevision` when existing prefixes must reapply runtime configuration. Release automation must not replace these values with hidden repository configuration.
- Do not claim Developer ID signing, notarization, or silent self-updates without an Apple Developer account.
