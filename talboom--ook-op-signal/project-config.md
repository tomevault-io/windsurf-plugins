# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"Ook op Signal" (Also on Signal) is a client-side web tool that lets users add a language-specific "Also on Signal" badge overlay to their profile picture. The tool encourages people to switch from WhatsApp to Signal. Live at [signalbadge.eu](https://www.signalbadge.eu) / [ookopsignal.eu](https://www.ookopsignal.eu).

## Tech Stack

- Static site with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build system, no bundler, no framework)
- CSS framework: Bulma 0.9.3 (via CDN)
- Icons: Font Awesome 6.5 (via CDN)
- Backend: Single PHP file (`analytics.php`) for page/click analytics with MySQL
- No package manager, no test framework

## Development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve with any static file server. No build step required.

## Important: No smart quotes in JavaScript

When editing `javascript/language.js` (or any `.js` file), never use typographic/curly quotes (`'` `'` `"` `"`) — only straight ASCII quotes (`'` `"`). The user's editor may auto-convert quotes on save. After writing to any JS file, verify the output contains only straight quotes. If curly quotes slip in, the entire file will fail to parse and all downstream scripts will break.

## Architecture

**Two pages:**
- `index.html` — Main tool page (upload photo, position crop, select badge, download)
- `waaromSignal.html` — "Why Signal?" informational page

**JavaScript modules (loaded as separate `<script>` tags, order matters):**
1. `javascript/burger.js` — Mobile navbar hamburger menu toggle
2. `javascript/language.js` — i18n system: contains all translations as a `translations` object and `overlayImages` language-to-badge mapping. Reads `?lang=` URL param, falls back to browser language, defaults to `nl`. Exposes global functions (`getLanguageFromUrl`, `setLanguage`, `translatePage`) and the `overlayImages` map used by other scripts
3. `javascript/upload.js` — Image upload handling, canvas rendering, spotlight (crop area) setup with resize handles. Depends on globals from `language.js` (`overlayImages`, `lang`)
4. `javascript/drag.js` — Makes the spotlight/crop area draggable and resizable (mouse + touch + pinch-to-zoom)
5. `javascript/download.js` — Crops image to spotlight area, composites the selected badge overlay, and triggers PNG download. Depends on globals from `language.js`
6. `javascript/analytics.js` — Sends page_visits/upload_clicks/download_clicks events to `analytics.php`

**Internationalization:**
- 10 languages: cs, de, en, es, fr, it, nl, pl, pt, sv
- All translations live in the `translations` object in `language.js`
- HTML elements use `data-i18n="key"` attributes; `translatePage()` sets innerHTML from translations
- `data-lang-only="nl"` hides/shows content for specific languages (used for NL-only "learn more" links)
- Internal links use `data-internal="true"` and `{{lang}}` placeholder in href, replaced at runtime
- Each language has a corresponding badge overlay PNG in `images/` (e.g., `alsoonsignal.png`, `ookopsignal.png`)

**Image processing pipeline (all client-side, no server upload):**
1. User uploads image → drawn to hidden `<canvas>`
2. A draggable/resizable "spotlight" div lets user select the crop area
3. On download: crop area coordinates are mapped back to canvas pixels, cropped to max 800x800, then the selected badge PNG is composited on top
