description: - Always use the venv when running python commands.

- Always use the venv when running python commands.
- Always use uv.
- DO NOT uses pyenv.
- Always use pyproject.toml, not requirements.txt.
- Instead of creating separate documents recording fixes, update the original code issue docs.
- After making any significant change to types, run pyright.
- Whenever providing hard-coded dates (e.g. when a report was updated) check the current date. You usually get it wrong, often by years.
- When running tests, make sure the output is streamed and not just buffered or hidden.
- Always lint a file after editing it.
