# nt_helper - Disting NT MIDI Helper

Flutter app for Disting NT Eurorack module: preset management, algorithm loading, parameter control via MIDI SysEx.

**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, Windows
**Modes:** Demo (no hardware), Offline (cached), Connected (live MIDI)

## Architecture

- **State:** Cubit pattern with delegate decomposition (`lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart`)
- **MIDI:** Interface-based with mock/offline/live implementations (`lib/domain/i_disting_midi_manager.dart`)
- **Database:** Drift ORM (`lib/db/database.dart`)
- **MCP:** Model Context Protocol server (`lib/services/mcp_server_service.dart`)

### DistingCubit Delegates

The main cubit is decomposed into delegates and mixins for maintainability.

**Rule of thumb**: keep `lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart` as an orchestration/facade layer. Add new non-trivial behavior in a delegate or an existing ops mixin.

| File | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `*_connection_delegate.dart` | Delegate | MIDI device connection |
| `*_parameter_fetch_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Parameter loading with retry |
| `*_parameter_refresh_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Live parameter polling |
| `*_parameter_value_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Parameter value writes + verification |
| `*_parameter_string_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Parameter value-string reads/writes |
| `*_mapping_delegate.dart` | Delegate | CV/MIDI/i2c/performance mappings |
| `*_slot_state_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Slot state updates + routing refresh |
| `*_slot_maintenance_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Slot repair/refresh/reset helpers |
| `*_state_refresh_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Refresh state from MIDI manager |
| `*_state_helpers_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Routing + offline metadata helpers |
| `*_algorithm_library_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Algorithm library refresh/rescan |
| `*_plugin_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Plugin installation |
| `*_sd_card_delegate.dart` | Delegate | SD card preset listing/scanning |
| `*_lua_reload_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Lua reload with state preservation |
| `*_offline_demo_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Demo/offline mode |
| `*_hardware_commands_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Screenshot/display/reboot/remount |
| `*_monitoring_delegate.dart` | Delegate | CPU monitoring + USB video |
| `*_refresh_delegate.dart` | Delegate | Refresh/cancelSync orchestration |
| `*_algorithm_ops.dart` | Mixin | Algorithm operations |
| `*_preset_ops.dart` | Mixin | Preset operations |
| `*_slot_ops.dart` | Mixin | Slot operations |

All use `part of 'disting_cubit.dart'` for private access. See `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for pattern details and guardrails.

## Routing System

OO framework in `lib/core/routing/` for data-driven routing visualization.

- `AlgorithmRouting.fromSlot()` creates routing from live Slot data
- `ConnectionDiscoveryService` discovers connections via bus assignments (1-12 inputs, 13-20 outputs)
- `RoutingEditorCubit` orchestrates state; `RoutingEditorWidget` displays only
- ES-5 algorithms (clck, eucp, clkm, clkd, pycv) support direct output routing via `Es5DirectOutputAlgorithmRouting`

## Key Files

| Area | Path |
|------|------|
| State | `lib/cubit/disting_cubit.dart` (+ delegates/mixins) |
| Routing | `lib/core/routing/algorithm_routing.dart` |
| Main UI | `lib/ui/synchronized_screen.dart` |
| Routing UI | `lib/ui/widgets/routing/routing_editor_widget.dart` |
| Metadata | `lib/services/algorithm_metadata_service.dart` |

## Graphify Codebase Graph

`nt_helper` is indexed in Substrate's registered `graphify-mcp` graph. Invoke
the `graphify` skill for graph search, architecture discovery, relationship
tracing, ownership/adjacency checks, or PR impact work. The skill is the source
of truth for live service discovery and tool routing.

Route every Graphify service lookup and tool call through `mcp__substrate`.
Use the `graphify-mcp__*` tools mapped by Substrate, or
`mcp__substrate.invoke_tool` when the compatibility wrapper is required. Never
connect to or invoke a standalone Graphify MCP server directly.

Use Graphify to find existing behavior before introducing a new helper,
delegate, service, or parallel implementation.

1. Start with the smallest useful query: `query_graph` for orientation,
   `get_node`/`get_neighbors` for a specific symbol, and `shortest_path` for a
   relationship between concepts.
2. For architecture or impact work, inspect the relevant communities rather
   than stopping at Community 0, which is only the largest cluster.
3. Treat Graphify as a map, not source truth. Confirm important findings with
   `rg` and the actual files in this checkout before editing.

Follow the skill's Substrate-registered service workflow rather than using
generic knowledge search, an external Graphify install, or a local graph
rebuild. Prefer plain `rg` for a simple exact text/file lookup. Use PR-impact
tools only for PR/merge work, and corroborate current GitHub status separately.

## Commands

```
flutter analyze          # Must pass with zero warnings
flutter test             # Run before commits
flutter run -d macos --print-dtd   # Run with DTD URL for MCP connection
```
