# CLAUDE.md — Break Tracker Development Rules

## What This Product Is

A real-time decision signal tool for sports card breaks. Users are in live streams, emotional, and need fast trust signals — not data to interpret.

Output is always one of: 🔴 Overpriced / 🟡 Fair / 🟢 Value / 🔥 Strong Buy Zone

Numbers are context, never the message.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- No backend. No server. No API calls. All logic runs client-side.
- No database. No persistence. No localStorage for state (session-only).
- No authentication. No user accounts. No identity.
- No external state libraries (no Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.). React `useState` and `useReducer` only.
- No CSS-in-JS runtime libraries (no styled-components, Emotion). Use Tailwind or CSS modules.
- Signal output must always be computed in < 1ms. It must never be async.
- The primary signal (emoji + label) must be visible without scrolling on any device.
- Never render raw computed numbers as the primary UI element. Numbers are always secondary.

---

## Architecture Boundaries

**Allowed:**
- Next.js (App Router, static export)
- React hooks for all state
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Plain TypeScript utility functions for computation
- `useMemo` for derived values

**Not Allowed:**
- Server components that fetch data
- API routes
- Any npm package that adds > 10KB gzipped to the bundle without clear justification
- Class components
- Context API for anything other than a single top-level config value (e.g., theme)

---

## State Model

Static template data is not dynamic state. Teams belong to `BreakTemplate`, not `BreakState`.

```ts
type Team = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  weight: number;
};

type BreakTemplate = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  teams: Team[];
};

type BreakState = {
  removedTeamIds: Set<string>;
  purchasedTeamIds: Set<string>;
  priceInput: number | null;
};
```

Derived values (never stored in state):
- `remainingTeams` — filter from `template.teams` minus `removedTeamIds`
- `remainingValue` — sum of weights of `remainingTeams`
- `fairValue` — `remainingValue / remainingTeams.length`
- `signal` — derived from `fairValue` vs `priceInput`

**Rules:**
- Derived values are computed inline or with `useMemo`. Never stored in state.
- State updates are synchronous. No async state mutations.
- Never nest state. Flat structures only.
- `removedTeamIds` and `purchasedTeamIds` use `Set<string>` keyed by team ID. No arrays of objects for these.

---

## Signal Computation

```ts
function getSignal(fairValue: number, price: number): Signal {
  const ratio = price / fairValue;
  if (ratio < 0.85) return 'STRONG_BUY';
  if (ratio < 0.98) return 'VALUE';
  if (ratio < 1.10) return 'FAIR';
  return 'OVERPRICED';
}
```

- Thresholds live in a single `constants.ts` file. Nowhere else.
- This function is pure. It takes numbers and returns a string. No side effects.
- Must have unit tests. This is the core of the product.

---

## Component Design Rules

**Split a component when:**
- It has its own local state unrelated to the parent
- It renders a repeated unit (e.g., each team in a list)
- It is reused in more than one place

**Do NOT split a component when:**
- The only reason is "it's getting long"
- The split would require threading props through a new intermediate component
- The extracted component would never be reused and has no independent state

**Max component depth for any feature: 3 levels.** If you're going deeper, the component model is wrong.

**Props:**
- No prop drilling past 2 levels. Lift state or rethink layout.
- No "god props" (objects with 10+ fields passed to a child). Pass what the child needs.

---

## Performance Rules

These must always be O(1) or trivially fast:

- Signal computation (`getSignal`)
- Rendering the signal display
- Any click handler on team removal

**Avoid:**
- `useEffect` for computing derived values — use `useMemo` or inline computation
- Sorting or filtering inside render without `useMemo`
- Re-rendering the full team list on every price keystroke — debounce price input at 150ms or derive signal only from the final committed value

---

## Validation Rules

- Validate numeric inputs at boundaries only — not deep inside compute functions
- Clamp impossible values instead of throwing errors
- Never block UI interaction because of a validation failure
- Prefer sane defaults over exceptions
- Pure compute functions must never return `NaN` — guard all division and coerce bad inputs at the edge
- Derived state must always have safe fallbacks (e.g., `fairValue` returns `0` when no teams remain, signal returns `null`)

---

## Testing Rules

**Must have unit tests:**
- All pure compute functions in `lib/`
- `getSignal` — every threshold boundary
- `computeFairValue` — including empty remaining set
- Edge cases: 0 remaining teams, `null` price input, duplicate toggles, empty templates

**Do NOT test:**
- UI snapshots
- Tailwind class output
- Click handlers in isolation
- E2E flows in v1

**Approach:**
- Vitest (or Jest if already present). No browser-based test runner.
- Tests live in a top-level `tests/` directory.
- No mocking — there are no network calls to isolate in v1.
