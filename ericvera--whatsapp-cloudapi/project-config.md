trigger: always_on
description: Applies to any file that contains code comments, including all test files
---

# Rules

## No inline comments
Comments should be on their own line above code, not at the end of code lines.

## Only explain complex segments of code
Do not add comments explaining the reasoning. Only add it for non-trivial sections of code.

## Document all exported entities
All exported entities must have documentation comments. All interface properties must have documentation comments.

# Examples

## Valid
```typescript
/** 
 * Represents a business entity that can have multiple locations
 */
export interface Business {
  id: ID

  /** Customer facing name of the business */
  name: string

  /** Timestamp of when the business was last updated */
  updated: Date
}
```

```typescript
// Test file example with proper comments
import { it, expect } from 'vitest'

// Authentication failure tests
it('throws when not authenticated', async () => {
  // Test implementation
})

// Authorization failure tests
it('throws when user does not have access', async () => {
  // Test implementation
})
```

## Invalid
```typescript
export interface Business { // Represents a business
  id: ID // Unique identifier
  name: string // Business name
  updated: Date // Last update time
}
```

```typescript
export interface Business {
  id: ID
  name: string  // Missing doc comment
  updated: Date
}
```

```typescript
expect(diff).toMatchInlineSnapshot() // Will be populated with the actual diff on first run
```
