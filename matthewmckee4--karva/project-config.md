- ALWAYS read CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to run tools
- ALWAYS attempt to add a test case for changed behavior. Get your tests to pass — if you didn't run the tests, your code does not work.
- PREFER integration tests, e.g., at `it/...` over unit tests.
- ALWAYS use snapshot tests when running a command in integration tests.
- PREFER running specific tests over running the entire test suite
- ALWAYS run `just test` to run all tests.
- ALWAYS run `uvx prek run -a` at the end of a task.
- FOLLOW existing code style. Check neighboring files for patterns.
- AVOID writing significant amounts of new code. Look for existing methods and utilities first.
- AVOID using `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `.unwrap()`, unsafe code, and clippy rule ignores. Encode constraints in the type system instead.
- PREFER patterns like `if let` to handle fallibility
- PREFER `#[expect()]` over `[allow()]` if clippy must be disabled
- PREFER let chains (`if let` combined with `&&`) over nested `if let` statements
- PREFER short imports over fully-qualified paths for readability.
- AVOID redundant comments and section separators (e.g., `// --- Section ---`) in test files. Use comments to explain invariants and why something unusual was done, not to narrate code.
- AVOID useless inline comments in tests (e.g., `// Run tests`, `// Accept remaining`, `// Review again`). The code should speak for itself. Only add comments when the intent is non-obvious.
- PREFER function comments over inline comments.
- ALWAYS add labels to PRs.
- ALWAYS use the pull request template when writing PR descriptions.
- ALWAYS write human-readable PR descriptions using paragraphs and code examples instead of bullet points.
- CONSIDER whether a change needs a docs update under `docs/`. Not every change does — internal refactors, bug fixes, and tweaks to existing behavior usually don't — but new flags, new public APIs, removed features, or changed defaults almost always do. When in doubt, check whether an existing page describes the area you touched.
