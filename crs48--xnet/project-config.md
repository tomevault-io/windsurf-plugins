# AGENTS.md — xNet coding agent guidelines

xNet is a local-first, CRDT-backed workspace: your data, synced everywhere,
owned by you. This file is loaded every session — keep it small. Surface-specific
conventions live in nested `AGENTS.md` files that load only when you read files
there.

## Skills

Invoke with the Skill tool. Repo-local skills live in `.claude/skills/`
(`.agents/skills` symlinks to it for Codex and Copilot).

| Skill                            | Read it when                                        |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `babysit-pr`                     | Driving a PR to green                               |
| `changelog`                      | You shipped something a user would notice           |
| `changeset`                      | You edited a publishable `packages/*` library       |
| `electron-prototype`             | Building or testing anything in `apps/electron`     |
| `explore`                        | Researching a topic into `docs/explorations/`       |
| `humanize`                       | Prose reads as machine-written; editing blog essays |
| `implement`                      | Executing an exploration's checklist                |
| `mvp-followup`                   | Deciding what to close out after a feature pass     |
| `verification-before-completion` | Before claiming done, or writing `[x]`              |
| `visual-exploration`             | An exploration is about UI and prose cannot show it |
| `writing-agent-instructions`     | Editing any `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md`               |

## Nested instructions

| Path                      | Covers                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web/AGENTS.md`      | Playwright, test auth bypass, viewport   |
| `apps/electron/AGENTS.md` | Prototyping ladder, ports, preload       |
| `apps/expo/AGENTS.md`     | Expo/EAS, no Node APIs                   |
| `packages/AGENTS.md`      | Barrels, changesets, `TaggedError`, seed |
| `packages/hub/AGENTS.md`  | Roles, wire format, authorization        |

<!-- Nested files are NOT re-injected after /compact; anything that must hold
     for a whole session belongs in this file, not a nested one. -->

## Build & test

```bash
pnpm install                      # install
pnpm build                        # build all packages
pnpm test                         # all tests (~2400)
pnpm --filter @xnetjs/data test   # one package
pnpm typecheck                    # turbo run typecheck
pnpm lint
```

Vitest resolves the **root** config: `pnpm --filter <pkg> test` runs every
project. Target one with `pnpm exec vitest run --project <name> <path>`.

## Project structure

`packages/*` are the libraries, `apps/*` the surfaces (`web`, `electron`,
`expo`, `cloud`, `demos`), `site/` the Astro marketing + docs site, `tests/*`
the e2e and reliability suites. `site/` installs with `--ignore-workspace` — it
cannot import `@xnetjs/*`.

## Spelling the brand: `xNet`

Lowercase x, uppercase N — in **everything a human reads**: prose, doc titles,
code comments, UI strings, CLI help, package descriptions, commit messages.
Never `XNet`, `Xnet` or `XNET`. Sentence-initial is still `xNet`; recast the
sentence rather than capitalising the mark.

Lowercase everywhere a machine reads: `@xnetjs/*`, the `xnet` bin, `xnet://`
URIs, file and database names.

| Where                                                 | Form                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Prose, comments, UI strings, commits                  | `xNet`                                  |
| npm packages, bins, URLs, DB/file names, env prefixes | all lowercase                           |
| Identifiers already named `XNet*`                     | leave as-is (`XNetProvider`, `useXNet`) |
| Mermaid node ids, `SCREAMING_SNAKE` constants         | leave as-is (`XNET_HUB_URL`)            |

**Existing identifiers keep their casing** — renaming one is a breaking change,
not a copy fix. The line is identifier vs copy, and it does not follow file
type: code samples inside markdown are code. When sweeping, match on a word
boundary (`\bXNet\b`) and skip fenced code blocks — `docs/plans/` and
`docs/explorations/` quote an `XNet` SDK class that an unbounded replace
silently corrupts.

## Code style

- **Imports**: named over default; type-only imports use `import type`.
- **Naming**: `camelCase` values, `PascalCase` types and components,
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE` consts.
- **TypeScript**: no `any` in new code; prefer inference over annotation.
- **Exports**: see `packages/AGENTS.md` for the sub-barrel policy.
- **Comments**: match the surrounding density. Explain _why_, not _what_.
- **React**: hooks at the top, no conditional hooks, prefer composition.
- **Styling**: prefer Tailwind over custom CSS.
- **Errors**: a `catch`, default, or coercion that returns a value callers
  cannot distinguish from success is a bug, not a guard. "Absent" and
  "unreadable" must be different values; a truncated run is not a completed one.
  Prefer a loud, typed failure over a plausible-looking normal state.
