- **PRD-First Development Mandate**
  - **PRD is Always the Foundation**: No development work begins without a completed, high-quality PRD
  - **PRD-Driven Discussions**: All technical discussions, feature planning, and implementation decisions must reference the PRD
  - **Quality Gate**: PRD completion and approval is the mandatory first milestone before any coding begins
  - **Single Source of Truth**: The PRD serves as the definitive reference for project scope, features, and technical approach

- **PRD Template Structure**
  - PRD files should be store at docs/project-name.prd.txt
  - Always use the standardized template format shown below
  - Maintain strict separation between `<context>` and `<PRD>` sections
  - Follow the exact section order and formatting specified

- **Complete PRD Template**
  ```
  <context>
  # Overview  
  [Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable.]

  # Core Features  
  [List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
  - What it does
  - Why it's important
  - How it works at a high level]

  # User Experience  
  [Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
  - User personas
  - Key user flows
  - UI/UX considerations]
  </context>
  <PRD>
  # Technical Architecture  
  [Outline the technical implementation details:
  - System components
  - Data models
  - APIs and integrations
  - Infrastructure requirements]

  # Development Roadmap  
  [Break down the development process into phases:
  - MVP requirements
  - Future enhancements
  - Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

  # Logical Dependency Chain
  [Define the logical order of development:
  - Which features need to be built first (foundation)
  - Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
  - Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

  # Risks and Mitigations  
  [Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
  - Technical challenges
  - Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
  - Resource constraints]

  # Appendix  
  [Include any additional information:
  - Research findings
  - Technical specifications]
  </PRD>
  ```

- **Mandatory PRD Development Workflow**
  - **Step 1: Product Design Discussion** - Collaborative exploration and vision refinement
  - **Step 2: PRD Consolidation** - Create comprehensive PRD using template above
  - **Step 3: PRD Quality Review** - Validate completeness and quality against checklist
  - **Step 4: PRD Approval** - Formal sign-off before any development begins
  - **Step 5: PRD-Driven Development** - All subsequent work references and builds upon the PRD

- **PRD Quality Requirements**
  - **High-Quality Standard**: PRD must be comprehensive, detailed, and complete before development
  - **No Shortcuts**: Never begin development with incomplete or draft PRDs
  - **Stakeholder Alignment**: PRD must represent shared understanding among all project stakeholders
  - **Technical Clarity**: Architecture and implementation approach must be clearly defined
  - **Actionable Detail**: Features must be detailed enough to generate specific development tasks

- **Product Design Discussion Phase**
  - **Start with Context Building**: Begin all product discussions by exploring the Overview, Core Features, and User Experience sections
  - **Collaborative Exploration**: Engage in iterative discussions to refine product vision before technical planning
  - **Key Discussion Areas**:
    - Problem definition and target audience identification
    - Feature prioritization and value proposition
    - User journey mapping and experience design
    - Market research and competitive analysis
  - **Documentation Practice**: Take detailed notes during discussions but avoid premature PRD creation
  - **Completion Criteria**: Discussion phase is complete only when all stakeholders have shared understanding

- **PRD Consolidation Requirements**
  - **Template Adherence**: Use the exact template format shown above
  - **Context Section (User-Facing)**:
    - `# Overview`: Clear problem statement, target audience, and value proposition
    - `# Core Features`: Detailed feature descriptions with importance and high-level functionality
    - `# User Experience`: User personas, key flows, and UI/UX considerations
  - **PRD Section (Implementation-Focused)**:
    - `# Technical Architecture`: System components, data models, APIs, infrastructure
    - `# Development Roadmap`: Phase-based breakdown focused on scope, not timelines
    - `# Logical Dependency Chain`: Foundation-first approach with atomic, buildable features
    - `# Risks and Mitigations`: Technical challenges, MVP strategy, resource planning
    - `# Appendix`: Research findings and technical specifications

- **Development Roadmap Guidelines**
  - **Scope-Focused Planning**: Emphasize feature scope and requirements over timeline estimates
  - **No Timeline Estimates**: As stated in template - "Do not think about timelines whatsoever"
  - **MVP-First Approach**: Define minimum viable product that delivers core value
  - **Atomic Feature Design**: Each feature should be complete, testable, and buildable in isolation
  - **Task-Ready Breakdown**: Detail features to the level where they can be converted into development tasks

- **Logical Dependency Chain Requirements**
  - **Foundation-First**: Identify and prioritize infrastructure and core system components
  - **Rapid Feedback Loop**: Prioritize getting a usable frontend working as quickly as possible
  - **Atomic Development**: Ensure each feature can be built independently while supporting future enhancements
  - **Build-Upon Strategy**: Design features to be incrementally improved as development progresses
  - **Dependency Visualization**: Clearly identify which features must be completed before others can begin

- **PRD-Driven Development Enforcement**
  - **All Code References PRD**: Every development decision should trace back to PRD specifications
  - **Feature Scope Control**: No features outside PRD scope without formal PRD updates
  - **Change Management**: PRD modifications require formal review and re-approval
  - **Progress Tracking**: Development progress measured against PRD milestones and dependency chain
  - **Documentation Alignment**: All technical documentation must align with PRD specifications

- **File Organization Standards**
  - **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names like `user-authentication.prd.txt` or `dashboard-analytics.prd.txt`
  - **Location**: Store PRDs in a dedicated `docs/` directory or similar documentation folder
  - **Version Control**: Include PRDs in version control for collaborative editing and history tracking
  - **Accessibility**: PRD must be easily accessible to all team members throughout development

- **Quality Assurance Checklist**
  ```markdown
  ✅ Context section completed with all three required subsections
  ✅ PRD section includes all six required subsections  
  ✅ Development roadmap focuses on scope over timelines
  ✅ Logical dependency chain prioritizes foundation and rapid frontend
  ✅ Technical architecture aligns with identified features
  ✅ Risks and mitigations address MVP strategy
  ✅ Format exactly matches template above
  ✅ Features are broken down to task-convertible level
  ✅ All stakeholders have reviewed and approved PRD
  ✅ PRD provides sufficient detail for development team
  ```

- **PRD Completion Gates**
  - **Completeness Gate**: All nine sections must be fully populated with substantive content
  - **Quality Gate**: Content must meet high standard for clarity, detail, and actionability
  - **Stakeholder Gate**: All relevant stakeholders must review and approve PRD
  - **Technical Gate**: Development team must confirm PRD provides sufficient technical guidance
  - **Ready Gate**: PRD must enable immediate task extraction and development planning

- **Cross-Tool Compatibility**
  - **Tool-Agnostic Format**: PRDs should be readable and usable by any project management system
  - **Plain Text Structure**: Use markdown-compatible formatting for maximum compatibility
  - **Task Extraction Ready**: Write features at a granularity that allows any tool to convert them into actionable tasks
  - **Documentation Standards**: Follow consistent formatting that works across different development workflows

- **Mandatory Workflow Pattern**
  ```markdown
  1. **Product Design Discussion Phase** (REQUIRED FIRST)
     - Collaborative brainstorming and vision refinement
     - User research and competitive analysis
     - Feature prioritization and value mapping
     - Complete stakeholder alignment
  
  2. **PRD Consolidation Phase** (REQUIRED SECOND)
     - Use template format above exactly
     - Complete all required sections with high quality
     - Focus on scope and atomic features
     - Pass all quality gates
  
  3. **PRD Approval Phase** (REQUIRED THIRD)
     - Formal review by all stakeholders
     - Technical validation by development team
     - Final approval before any coding begins
  
  4. **PRD-Driven Development Phase** (ONLY AFTER PRD COMPLETE)
     - Extract tasks from completed PRD
     - Set up project tracking referencing PRD
     - Begin implementation following dependency chain
     - All decisions reference PRD as source of truth
  ```

- **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
  - ❌ Starting any development work before PRD completion and approval
  - ❌ Creating PRDs without the product design discussion phase
  - ❌ Accepting incomplete or low-quality PRDs as "good enough"
  - ❌ Making feature decisions that aren't grounded in the PRD
  - ❌ Modifying scope without formal PRD updates
  - ❌ Including timeline estimates in the development roadmap
  - ❌ Skipping the logical dependency chain analysis
  - ❌ Creating features that cannot be built atomically
  - ❌ Proceeding with unclear or ambiguous PRD sections
