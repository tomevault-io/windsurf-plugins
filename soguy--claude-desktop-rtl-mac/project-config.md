# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A macOS-specific patcher that adds RTL (Hebrew/Arabic) support to Claude Desktop. It does **not** modify the original `/Applications/Claude.app` — it produces a separate patched copy at `~/Applications/Claude-RTL.app`. The RTL detection JS (`rtl-payload.js`) is from the upstream Windows project [shraga100/claude-desktop-rtl-patch](https://github.com/shraga100/claude-desktop-rtl-patch); the value-add of this repo is the macOS patching pipeline.

## Commands

```bash
./patch.sh --install     # Build patched copy at ~/Applications/Claude-RTL.app and launch it
./patch.sh --uninstall   # Delete the patched copy (original is never touched)
./patch.sh --status      # Show installed versions + ASAR fuse state
./patch.sh               # Interactive menu
```

`--install` is idempotent — re-running it removes any prior patched copy first, and the JS injection itself is guarded by a `CLAUDE RTL PATCH START` marker. There is no test suite, lint, or build step; the only artifact is the patched `.app` bundle.

Runtime deps (checked by `check_dependencies` in [patch.sh:83](patch.sh#L83)): `npx` (Node ≥16, used to fetch `@electron/asar` and `@electron/fuses` on demand) and `codesign` (Xcode CLI tools). No `package.json` — npm tooling is invoked via `npx --yes`.

## Patching pipeline (patch.sh)

The whole pipeline lives in [patch.sh](patch.sh) — a single bash script with `set -euo pipefail`. Steps in `install_patch` ([patch.sh:130](patch.sh#L130)):

1. `cp -R` the source app to `~/Applications/Claude-RTL.app`.
2. Replace `Contents/Resources/electron.icns` with `icon.icns` and **delete** `CFBundleIconName` from `Info.plist` — macOS prefers the asset-catalog icon over the `.icns` file unless that key is removed ([patch.sh:162](patch.sh#L162)).
3. Set `CFBundleDisplayName=Claude-RTL`. Do **not** change `CFBundleName` — Electron's fuse lookup reads `CFBundleName` and changing it breaks the next step ([patch.sh:169](patch.sh#L169)).
4. `asar extract` → prepend a combined header (`rtl-payload.js` + an optional `@font-face` injector built by `build_font_injector`) to every `.js` file under `.vite/build/` **except the Electron main-process entry** (read from the extracted `package.json`'s `"main"` field, currently `index.pre.js`) → `asar pack`. Injecting the payload into the main process makes Electron fail to spawn any `BrowserWindow` at startup (black-screen launch); skipping that one file is the fix. The font injector only runs when `--font NAME` (or `RTL_FONT_FAMILY=NAME`) is set — the default is no font replacement. The injection is also skipped per-file if the `CLAUDE RTL PATCH START` marker is already present ([patch.sh:188](patch.sh#L188)).
5. `@electron/fuses write … EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation=off`. **Required** — Electron validates the ASAR hash at startup and the modified archive will crash the app without this.
6. `codesign --force --deep --sign - --entitlements <plist>` (ad-hoc). The original Anthropic signature is invalidated by the ASAR/fuse changes; ad-hoc signing is what lets macOS launch the modified bundle. Entitlements are extracted from `$SOURCE_APP` and re-applied — without them, runtime entitlement checks fail (notably Cowork, which calls `@ant/claude-swift`'s VM check and shows "installation appears to be corrupted" when `com.apple.security.virtualization` is missing). Three team-id-coupled keys are stripped before re-signing: `com.apple.application-identifier`, `com.apple.developer.team-identifier`, `keychain-access-groups` — they reference Anthropic's team ID `Q6L2SF6YDW` and macOS rejects them under an ad-hoc signature.

`quit_claude_rtl` ([patch.sh:113](patch.sh#L113)) is deliberately scoped to the `Claude-RTL.app` bundle path so it never touches the user's running original Claude Desktop or Claude Code CLI.

## RTL payload (rtl-payload.js)

A self-contained IIFE wrapped in `// --- CLAUDE RTL PATCH START ---` / `--- END ---` markers (the start marker is what `patch.sh` greps for to skip already-patched files). Bails out early if `document` is undefined so it's safe to prepend to any renderer bundle, including ones that may run in a non-DOM context. Uses a `MutationObserver` to handle Claude's streamed responses and force-keeps `<pre>`/`<code>` LTR. When editing payload behavior, preserve the start/end marker comments — removing them breaks idempotency. The font-family for RTL text is *not* set here — it's injected by `build_font_injector` only when the user opts in (see below) so the family name has a single source of truth.

## RTL font (fonts/ + build_font_injector)

Font replacement is **opt-in, not on by default** — the patch leaves Claude's font alone unless the user passes `--font NAME` (or sets `RTL_FONT_FAMILY=NAME`). When opted in, the font is **embedded as a base64 `data:` URI**, not loaded from a CDN or a local file. This is forced by Claude's enforced CSP: the main window is `font-src 'self' data:` with `connect-src 'none'`, and the artifact-preview sandbox is `font-src data:` — so external hosts (Google Fonts/jsDelivr) are blocked and a `data:` URI is the only source that works in every context.
