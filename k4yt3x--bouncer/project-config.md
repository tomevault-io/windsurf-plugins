# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Rust Coding Guidelines

- Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
- Do not write organizational or comments that summarize the code. Comments should only be written in order to explain "why" the code is written in some way in the case there is a reason that is tricky / non-obvious.
- Prefer implementing functionality in existing files unless it is a new logical component. Avoid creating many small files.
- Avoid using functions that panic like `unwrap()`, instead use mechanisms like `?` to propagate errors.
- Be careful with operations like indexing which may panic if the indexes are out of bounds.
- Never silently discard errors with `let _ =` on fallible operations. Always handle errors appropriately:
    - Propagate errors with `?` when the calling function should handle them
    - Use `.log_err()` or similar when you need to ignore errors but want visibility
    - Use explicit error handling with `match` or `if let Err(...)` when you need custom logic
    - Example: avoid `let _ = client.request(...).await?;` - use `client.request(...).await?;` instead
- When implementing async operations that may fail, ensure errors propagate to the UI layer so users get meaningful feedback.
- Never create files with `mod.rs` paths - prefer `src/some_module.rs` instead of `src/some_module/mod.rs`.
- When creating new crates, prefer specifying the library root path in `Cargo.toml` using `[lib] path = "...rs"` instead of the default `lib.rs`, to maintain consistent and descriptive naming (e.g., `gpui.rs` or `main.rs`).
- Avoid creative additions unless explicitly requested
- Use full words for variable names (no abbreviations like "q" for "queue")
- Use variable shadowing to scope clones in async contexts for clarity, minimizing the lifetime of borrowed references.
  Example:
    ```rust
    executor.spawn({
        let task_ran = task_ran.clone();
        async move {
            *task_ran.borrow_mut() = true;
        }
    });
    ```

## Build & Formatting Commands

- Always run `cargo fmt` and `cargo sort -w` after editing code
- Always run `cargo build` after completing all tasks

## Changelog

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` after every meaningful change (new features, bug fixes, breaking changes, deprecations, removals)
- Follow the [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format
- Add entries under the `[Unreleased]` section
- Keep each changelog entry to around 100 characters (soft limit)
