# Cursor AI Rules Configuration

This configuration guides the AI assistant to generate content that matches project conventions. It does not affect any existing CI/CD or other validation rules.

## Git Commit Message Rules

### Principles
- Commit messages must be written in English.
- The commit message should clearly describe what changed in this commit.
- Follow Conventional Commits, but use English descriptions.
- Use an ordered list for detailed change items.

### Commit Type Prefixes
Use the following standard prefixes, followed by an English description:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (neither a new feature nor a bug fix)
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `style`: Code style/formatting changes (no functional changes)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test-related changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tooling changes
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration and scripts changes
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

### Commit Format Requirements
- **Subject line**: type prefix + one concise summary (recommended ≤ 50 characters)
- **Details**: use an ordered list to enumerate specific change points
- Keep the subject short; put details in the list

## Commit Log Examples

```
