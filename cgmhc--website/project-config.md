- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment with auto-deploy

### Future Enhancements (Not Planned)
- Comparison page (`src/app/compare/page.tsx`)

## Key Files and Their Purpose

### Data
- `data/IHCC Covid Mental Health Master Cohort Table.xlsx` - Source data file (Excel, 27 cohorts, 68 columns)
- `public/cohorts.json` - Processed JSON data (regenerate with `npm run convert-data`)
- `public/data/` - Editable data files:
  - `project.json` - Grant info, mission statement, scientific aims
  - `institutions.json` - Institution definitions (MGB, Oxford, USP, etc.)
  - `team.json` - Team members/investigators array
  - `cohort-associations.json` - Cohort-PI mappings and data access info
- `public/headshots/` - Team member photos (mgb/, oxford/, usp/, other/)
- `scripts/convert-excel.js` - Excel to JSON conversion script

### Core Application
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Landing page with consortium overview (SERVER COMPONENT)
- `src/app/explorer.tsx` - Explorer component with map/list views (CLIENT COMPONENT)
- `src/app/explorer/page.tsx` - Explorer page wrapper
- `src/app/cohort/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual cohort detail page (SERVER COMPONENT, statically generated)
- `src/app/investigators/page.tsx` - Team/investigators page (SERVER COMPONENT)
- `src/app/publications/page.tsx` - Publications page placeholder (SERVER COMPONENT)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with FilterProvider

### Components
- `src/components/Map/CohortMap.tsx` - Leaflet map with dynamic import (avoids SSR issues)
- `src/components/Filters/FilterSidebar.tsx` - Filter sidebar with collapsible sections
- `src/components/CohortList/CohortList.tsx` - Table view of cohorts
- `src/components/ui/SiteHeader.tsx` - **Shared navigation header** used by all pages (logo, nav links, optional page title)
- `src/components/ui/Header.tsx` - Explorer-specific header extending SiteHeader with search bar and view toggle

### Data & Types
- `src/lib/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces (Cohort, FilterState, measure interfaces)
- `src/lib/investigators.ts` - TypeScript interfaces (Investigator, Institution, ScientificAim)
- `src/lib/data.ts` - Data utilities (filtering, grouping, formatting)
- `src/lib/constants.ts` - Country coordinates, colors, map config

### State Management
- `src/contexts/FilterContext.tsx` - Global filter state with React Context
- Manages: filters, viewMode, selectedCohorts for comparison

## Data Structure

The Excel file has a two-row header structure:
- Row 1: Category names (Administration, Characteristics, Life History, etc.)
- Row 2: Column names (Cohort, Country, Baseline age range, etc.)
- Row 3+: Cohort data

### Main Categories
1. **Administration** (cols 1-4): Cohort name, Country, 5yrs waves, Data access
2. **Characteristics** (cols 5-7): Population, Age range, Longitudinal status
3. **Life History** (cols 8-13): Discrimination, Deprivation, Abuse measures
4. **Sociodemographic** (cols 14-24): Demographics and SES variables
5. **Psychological Status** (cols 25-51): Mental health measures
6. **Cognitive Status** (cols 52-56): Cognitive measures
7. **Lifestyle** (cols 57-60): Behavioral measures
8. **Covid-19** (cols 61-68): Pandemic-specific measures

### Data Values
- "yes" / "no" / "n/a" for boolean availability
- Some fields have detailed text (e.g., "yes (KSADS)", "yes (EHR)")
- Numeric values for population counts

## Design Decisions

### Tech Stack Choices
- **Next.js 14 App Router**: Modern React with server components, good for SEO
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development, consistent design system
- **Leaflet**: Open-source maps, no API key required
- **Static JSON**: Pre-processed data for fast loading, no backend needed

### Architecture Decisions
- Static site generation where possible for performance
- Client-side filtering for instant user feedback
- URL-based filter state for shareability
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Common Tasks

### Updating Data
When the Excel file is updated:
1. Run `npm run convert-data` to regenerate `public/cohorts.json`
2. Test that all cohorts display correctly
3. Check that filters still work with any new values

### Adding New Filters
1. Add filter type to `src/lib/types.ts`
2. Add filter component in `src/components/Filters/`
3. Update `FilterContext.tsx` with new filter state
4. Update filtering logic in `src/lib/data.ts`

### Adding New Data Fields
1. Update types in `src/lib/types.ts`
2. Update conversion script to include new field
3. Update detail page to display new field
4. Consider if field should be filterable

## Testing

```bash
npm run lint      # Check code style
npm run typecheck # TypeScript validation
npm run test      # Run tests (if configured)
```

## Deployment

The app is deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions:
1. Push to main branch triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Build runs with static export (`output: 'export'` in next.config.ts)
3. Auto-deploys to https://cgmhc.github.io/website

Configuration notes:
- `basePath: '/website'` in next.config.ts for GitHub Pages subdirectory
- `images: { unoptimized: true }` required for static export

For local development:
```bash
npm run dev   # Development server at localhost:3000/website (basePath configured)
npm run build # Production build
```

## Performance Considerations

- Map markers are clustered to avoid rendering issues
- Images should be optimized before adding to public/
- Large data transformations happen at build time, not runtime
- Use React.memo for components that re-render frequently

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible
- Map should have text alternatives
- Color is not the only indicator of information
- Filters maintain focus appropriately

## Known Limitations & Issues

- Some cohorts span multiple countries (handled as single entry with first country's coordinates)
- **Age range data issue**: Some Excel cells containing "9-10" are interpreted as dates by Excel, showing as serial numbers like "45179" in the JSON. May need manual correction in Excel or conversion script fix.
- Map uses simple markers, not true clustering library - overlapping markers at same coordinates may be hard to distinguish
- LMIC Cohorts entry has empty country field
- Filter state not yet synced to URL params

## Next Steps (Phase 3 Priorities)

1. **Fix data issues** - Address age range date parsing issue
2. **Comparison page** - Side-by-side cohort comparison
3. **Mobile responsiveness** - Filter drawer, touch-friendly controls
4. **UI polish** - Loading states, animations, better typography

## Updating Data

### Data File Structure
Data is organized into separate files for easier maintenance:

```
public/
├── cohorts.json              # Auto-generated from Excel (don't edit directly)
└── data/
    ├── project.json          # Grant info, mission statement, scientific aims
    ├── institutions.json     # Institution definitions
    ├── team.json             # Team members/investigators
    └── cohort-associations.json  # Cohort-PI mappings
```

### Editing Team Members
To update team member information, edit `public/data/team.json`:
- Add `credentials` (e.g., "MD, PhD")
- Add `title` (e.g., "Associate Professor")
- Change `role` - supports custom strings like "Faculty", "Project Manager", "Collaborator", "Consultant"
- Add `email` for email contact icon
- Add `orcid` ID (e.g., "0000-0001-2345-6789") - will auto-link to orcid.org
- Set `isConsultant: true` to display in Consultants section
- Set `role: "Collaborator"` to display in Collaborators section
- Add new team members following the existing structure

### Editing Project Info
To update mission statement or grant info, edit `public/data/project.json`:
- `scientificMission` - Mission statement text on landing page
- `projectInfo.grantTitle` - Grant title
- `projectInfo.grantNumber` - NIH grant number
- `scientificAims` - Array of scientific aims (displayed on investigators page)

### Editing Institutions
To add or modify institutions, edit `public/data/institutions.json`:
- Add new institution with `id`, `name`, `shortName`, `location`, `website`

### Editing Cohort Associations
To update cohort PIs or add cohorts, edit `public/data/cohort-associations.json`:
- `cohortId` - Must match ID in cohorts.json
- `cohortName` - Display name
- `piNames` - Array of PI names
- `dataAccess` - "DPUK" or "Federated"
- `cgmhcCollaborators` - Array of linked team member IDs (e.g., `[{ "investigatorId": "brunoni-andre" }]`)
  - Links team members to cohorts, displays them in "CGMHC Collaborators" section on cohort detail pages
  - Use the `id` field from team.json (e.g., "brunoni-andre" for André Brunoni)

### Available Institutions
- `mgb` - Mass General Brigham
- `oxford` - University of Oxford
- `usp` - University of São Paulo
- `ufrgs` - Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul
- `harvard` - Harvard University
- `dalhousie` - Dalhousie University
