# AGENTS.md

Guidance for agents working in this repository. See `README.md` for what the
tool does from a user's point of view.

## What this is

A per-terminal CPU and memory monitor for Ghostty on macOS, plus a focused-tab
time tracker. One binary, one file: `src/main.rs`.

## Hard constraints

These are the rules that shape most decisions here. Check a change against them
before writing code.

- **Zero dependencies.** `Cargo.lock` contains exactly one package: this one.
  Everything is the standard library plus command-line tools that ship with
  macOS (`ps`, `lsof`, `ioreg`, `osascript`, `stty`, `launchctl`, `pgrep`).
  Do not add a crate. If something seems to need one, it almost certainly does
  not — the TUI, the ANSI handling, the mouse decoding, and the civil-date maths
  are all hand-rolled here already.
- **Setup stays trivial.** Build and run; no config file, no flags required, no
  setup steps. The intent is for this to be installable with a single command
  (a Bun-installable package is the eventual goal), so anything that adds an
  install step works against the point of the tool.
- **Never modify Ghostty.** Ghostty is observed, never patched or configured.
  Everything comes from read-only queries: its AppleScript dictionary at
  `/Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/Ghostty.sdef`, plus `ps`/`lsof`.
- **macOS only.** `main` exits early on other platforms.
- **Data is append-only and versioned.** Files under
  `~/Library/Application Support/ghostty-top/` are never pruned or rewritten.
  A schema change means a new `-v2` file, not an edited `-v1` one.

## Commands

```sh
cargo build              # or --release
cargo test               # 32 unit tests, all in the tests module in main.rs
cargo clippy --all-targets   # expected to be silent
cargo fmt
```

Run it without touching your real history by pointing `HOME` at a scratch
directory — every data path is derived from `HOME`:

```sh
HOME=/tmp/scratch ./target/debug/ghostty-top --seed-demo-history
HOME=/tmp/scratch ./target/debug/ghostty-top --track
```

`--once` prints a single snapshot and needs no terminal, which makes it the
quickest way to check the monitor. The interactive TUI needs a tty; drive it
under `script` when you need to see a real frame:

```sh
(printf 'u'; sleep 3; printf 'q') | script -q /dev/null ./target/debug/ghostty-top
```

## Two platforms

macOS is the primary target; Linux runs the monitor. Every difference is
`#[cfg]`-gated and collected near the top of the file — put new ones there
rather than branching at the call site.

- Data lives under `Application Support` on macOS and `XDG_DATA_HOME` on Linux.
- `ps` is `-axo …command=` (BSD) versus `-eo …args=` (procps); `stty` takes
  `-f` versus `-F`; no tty prints as `??` versus `?` (use `has_tty`).
- A terminal's root process is `/usr/bin/login` on macOS. Linux Ghostty execs
  the shell directly, so any child of Ghostty holding a tty is a surface.
- Working directories come from `lsof` on macOS and `/proc/PID/cwd` on Linux.
- **Focused-tab tracking is macOS only.** Ghostty reports the focused tab
  through AppleScript and offers nothing equivalent elsewhere, so `TRACKS_FOCUS`
  is false on Linux and the calendar says so. Do not fake it by watching window
  focus: that measures the app, not the tab, and would quietly record wrong
  numbers.

CI runs the full suite on both platforms with `-D warnings`, so a `#[cfg]` that
leaves dead code or an ungated test fails the build. Check both locally before
pushing, and read the **exit code** rather than grepping the output:

```sh
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Releasing

The npm package ships one **universal** binary and `bin` points straight at it.
There is deliberately no launcher script: Bun does not run install scripts by
default, and a Bun-only user may have no Node to run a JS shim with. Keep it
that way — a shim would break `bun install -g` for exactly the audience this
tool is for.

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin   # once, for Intel support
./scripts/build-binaries.sh             # lipo both slices into binaries/
npm publish                             # version comes from package.json
```

`scripts/build-binaries.sh` warns and keeps going when a target is missing, so
check its `lipo -info` output says `arm64 x86_64` before publishing. Keep
`version` in `package.json` and `Cargo.toml` in step.

## Layout of `src/main.rs`

Roughly in file order: constants and types, `App` (state and input handling),
`UsageStore`/`UsageTracker` (persistence and sampling), the macOS query helpers,
`main` and the event loop, process aggregation, leak analysis, the two render
functions, small formatters, then `mod tests`.

Two views share one `App`: `View::Monitor` and `View::Usage`.

## Things that are easy to get wrong

**Click targets must be computed, not hardcoded.** Rendering returns a `Layout`
holding `ClickZone`s built while the line is assembled, so hit boxes and drawn
text cannot drift apart. Earlier versions hardcoded column ranges and they
silently went stale. When adding a clickable thing, emit a zone; do not write a
