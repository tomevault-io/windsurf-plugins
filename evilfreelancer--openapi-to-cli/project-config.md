## Workflow Rules

### Documentation

- Main documentation is `README.md` in the root of `openapi-to-cli`.
- When changing CLI behavior, profile format or `.ocli` structure, update `README.md`.
- All documentation for this project must be written in English.

### New features (TDD)

When adding new functionality to `openapi-to-cli`:

1. First write a test in `tests/` (for example for profile parsing or command generation).
2. Run the test and make sure it fails.
3. Implement the feature in `src/` following architecture and code-style rules.
4. Run the test again and make sure it passes.
5. Run all tests: `npm test` from the `openapi-to-cli` directory.

### Bug fixes (TDD)

When fixing a bug:

1. Write a test that reproduces the bug.
2. Make sure the test fails.
3. Fix the code.
4. Make sure the test passes.
5. Run all tests.

### Tests

- Tests are stored in `tests/` next to `src/`.
- Test file names: `*.test.ts`.
- Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```
