## Architectural Rules

### General Architecture

The `openapi-to-cli` project is a Node.js/TypeScript CLI application that:

- reads an OpenAPI/Swagger spec from a URL or file;
- caches the spec in `.ocli/specs`;
- uses profiles to describe connected APIs;
- maps OpenAPI operations to `ocli` subcommands.

### Data Flow

```text
ocli onboard --options --> write profile (profiles.ini) --> download OpenAPI --> save to .ocli/specs
       |
       v
ocli [--profile] <tool> [options] --> load profile + cached spec --> build commands from OpenAPI --> perform HTTP request to API_BASE_URL
```

### Components

- **config** - locate and select `.ocli` directory, resolve `profiles.ini` paths with global and local priority.
- **profile-store** - read and write profile INI files (`profiles.ini`), select current profile.
- **openapi-loader** - load spec from URL or file and cache it into `.ocli/specs/<profile>.json`.
- **openapi-to-commands** - parse OpenAPI, apply include/exclude filters, build command names and option schemas.
- **cli** - entry point, argument parser, command registration, help rendering.

### Design Principles

1. **OpenAPI-driven** - the list of commands and their parameters is defined by the spec.
2. **Profiles** - all API settings are configured via profiles (global or local).
3. **Spec cache** - the spec is cached under `.ocli/specs` to avoid fetching it on every run.
4. **TypeScript strict** - `strict: true`; explicit types for public APIs and profile interfaces.
5. **TDD for core logic** - unit tests for profile parsing, spec loading and command mapping.
6. **Language** - all documentation and code comments for this project must be written in English.

### Repository Layout (for the openapi-to-cli directory)

- `README.md` - concept and description of the CLI and profiles.
- `package.json` - npm package with the `ocli` binary.
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config with strict mode.
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration.
- `src/`:
  - `cli.ts` - `ocli` binary entry point.
  - future modules: `config`, `profile-store`, `openapi-loader`, `openapi-to-commands`, etc.
- `tests/` - tests for the modules above.
