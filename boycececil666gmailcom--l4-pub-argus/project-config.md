# Code Organization

## Region Structure

Always divide files into named regions in this order:

```python
# region Imports
...
# endregion

# region Constants
...
# endregion

# region Fields / Private
...
# endregion

# region Fields / Public
...
# endregion

# region Initialization
...
# endregion

# region Private Methods
...
# endregion

# region Public Methods / API
...
# endregion
```

For languages that support it, use the native syntax:
- **C# / JS / TS**: `#region Name` / `#endregion`
- **Python**: `# region Name` / `# endregion`

Only include regions that are relevant — skip empty ones.

## Member Ordering

Within each file, order members as:
1. Imports / dependencies
2. Constants and config
3. Private fields / state
4. Public fields / properties
5. Constructor / init
6. Private methods (helpers, internals)
7. Public methods / API surface

## API Comments

Add a docstring/comment to every public function, class, or method that is part of the external API or called from other modules. Include:
- What it does (one line)
- Parameters (if non-obvious)
- Return value (if non-obvious)
- Exceptions it may raise

```python
# ✅ GOOD
def query_range(start_ts: float, end_ts: float, include_idle: bool = False) -> list:
    """Return snapshots in [start_ts, end_ts).

    Args:
        start_ts: Unix timestamp range start (inclusive).
        end_ts: Unix timestamp range end (exclusive).
        include_idle: If True, include idle snapshots.
    """

# ❌ BAD — no doc on a public API function
def query_range(start_ts, end_ts):
    ...
```

Internal / private helpers only need a comment if the logic is non-obvious.
