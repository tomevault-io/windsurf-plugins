# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository is the standalone home for the `pagespeed-optimization` Codex skill.

## Scope

- Keep this repo focused on one skill only.
- Preserve alignment between `SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, and `references/`.
- Update the documentation when the official guidance or supported stack patterns change.

## Working Rules

- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Do not add unrelated skills, templates, or project-specific clutter.
- Keep examples practical and implementation-oriented.
- Do not weaken performance guidance to make the repo easier to read.

## Validation

- Confirm `SKILL.md` frontmatter stays valid.
- Confirm the references still match the skill body.
- Re-check official docs when changing metric guidance, Next.js image guidance, React hooks guidance, or TypeScript patterns.

## Repo Layout

- `SKILL.md` - canonical skill definition
- `agents/openai.yaml` - Codex UI metadata
- `references/` - official notes and implementation examples
- `docs/` - repo-level documentation and alignment notes

## Done Criteria

- The skill is documented clearly.
- The skill remains faithful to the official sources.
- The repo is ready to publish as a single-skill repository.
