# Repository Guidelines

## Change scope

- Keep each pull request focused. Split unrelated behavior fixes, mechanical renames or moves, formatting, and tooling changes into separate pull requests. If feature work depends on a general prerequisite fix, add its regression test and land it first.
- Keep diffs minimal: do not change unrelated whitespace, indentation, names, or unaffected backend paths. Keep backend-specific fixes scoped to that backend and validate them there.

## Design and invariants

- Treat impossible internal states and invalid lifecycle calls as programmer errors: assert or fail fast instead of adding recoverable error plumbing. For explicitly recoverable runtime failures, propagate the error and preserve the promised recovery contract.
- Prefer direct data flow and standard lifecycle mechanisms. Remove redundant state, ad hoc cleanup registries, and intermediate error-message plumbing when they add no behavior.

## Tests and validation

- Every bug fix or semantic behavior change must add a focused regression test covering the reported failure and any newly promised recovery path. Verify that the test fails without the fix and passes with it.
- Assert observable data and complete state transitions, not only that an API returned successfully. For scoped state, check the relevant values before, during, and after the scope.
- Put new tests in the existing test tree and make them runnable through the repository's standard test convention. Write shared scenarios to run on every backend and hook mode that supports the behavior without weakening existing coverage.
- Before merging, run the full regression suite and the relevant affected-backend tests, then paste the complete passing results in the pull request. Include before-and-after evidence for fixes when practical.

## Comments and documentation

- Prefer self-explanatory code. Remove comments that restate the code and delete commented-out code; keep concise comments for non-obvious constraints or examples explicitly written as tutorials.
- Keep README updates brief and avoid bold emphasis. When a user workflow changes, document the simplest supported path and preserve guidance for known downstream integrations.
