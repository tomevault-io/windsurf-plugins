## Comments are maintenance context

- Preserve existing comments unless they are factually wrong, obsolete, or explicitly requested for removal.
- Never remove comments merely to align code with repository style or a general preference for fewer comments.
- Treat comments about undocumented SUNAT behavior, manual sections, production verification, required parameters, runtime differences, privacy, safety, and implementation rationale as part of the maintained contract.
- When moving or refactoring code, move or update its contextual comments with it.
- If a comment must be removed, preserve its still-valid context in nearby code, tests, or documentation and explain the removal in the pull request.
- Add concise comments when surprising behavior or external evidence would otherwise be lost. Do not narrate obvious syntax.
