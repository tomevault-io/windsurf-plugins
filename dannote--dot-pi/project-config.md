# Development Guidelines

## Installation

Enable extensions, skills, and rules by creating symlinks in `~/.pi/agent/`:

```bash
# Extensions
ln -s /path/to/dot-pi/extensions/codesearch.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/

# Skills
ln -s /path/to/dot-pi/skills/ai-news ~/.pi/agent/skills/

# Rules
ln -s /path/to/dot-pi/rules/typescript.md ~/.pi/agent/rules/
```

Each symlink points directly to the source file or directory. No intermediate symlinks.

## Adding New Components

When adding new extensions, skills, or rules:

1. Add entry to the corresponding table in `README.md`
2. Keep tables alphabetically sorted
3. Include Origin column with link to source if adapted from another project
4. Commit both the component and README update together
