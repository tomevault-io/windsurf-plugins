description: - Add SUCCINCT docblocks to structs and methods.
---

## Code documentation

- Add SUCCINCT docblocks to structs and methods.
- Give an added focus to Domain definitions.
- Do NOT document things that are painfully obvious. For example, a `Rect { w: int64, h: int64 }` has no need for documentation.
- If an implication is particularly complicated, document implementation sections.

## Verifying (MUST BE RUN BEFORE CONSIDERING A TASK COMPLETE)

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo test --all-features`
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all`
- Any live, end-to-end testing can be done with the `herdr` CLI and `/herdr` agent skill.
