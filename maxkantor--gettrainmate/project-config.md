# Frontend changes → commit and push

When you change any `*.ts` / `*.tsx` under `apps/web/` (including tests; `*.ts*` covers both):

1. Run **`npm run web:build`** from the repo root if the change affects production bundles (skip only for comment-only or trivial edits).
2. **`git add`** only paths under `apps/web/` (and `package-lock.json` if npm changed it for the web workspace). Do not stage unrelated root zips (`*.zip`) unless the user asked.
3. **`git commit`** with a clear message (e.g. `fix(web): …` or `feat(web): …`).
4. **`git push`** to the tracked upstream (e.g. `origin` + current branch).

If the working tree has no staged diff after add, do not create an empty commit. If push fails (auth/network), report the error and stop.
