# seo-survival-kit: project instructions for Claude Code

## What this repository is

seo-survival-kit is a Claude Code plugin (marketplace name `seo-survival-kit`, plugin name `seo-rescue`) that bundles seven SEO skills built from real e-commerce recovery work after Google Core Updates. It is MIT-licensed, has zero npm runtime dependencies, and is published at https://github.com/maxschottke-spec/seo-survival-kit.

```

The plugin has two layers:

1. **Pure-Markdown framework skills** — `post-core-update-recovery`, `ai-search-rescue`, and parts of `seo-audit-free`. No scripts. They encode SEO decision frameworks that Claude applies to user-specific situations. Work as standalone documentation even without the rest of the plugin.

2. **Script-backed skills** — `seo-outreach-report`, `competitor-deep-audit`, `psi-weekly-cron-baseline`, and parts of `seo-audit-free`. Plain Node.js scripts that the user (or Claude on their behalf) invokes with `node script.js`. No `package.json`, so no install step, so no npm supply-chain attack surface.

## Routing

The `rescue` skill is the orchestrator. Users can either:

- Type `/seo-rescue:rescue` to see the routing table and let Claude choose the right sub-skill, or
- Call any sub-skill directly via `/seo-rescue:<skill-name>` (e.g. `/seo-rescue:seo-audit-free example.com`)

Each sub-skill has `user-invokable: true` and an `argument-hint` in its YAML frontmatter so Claude Code's autocomplete shows it.

## Skill-naming convention

We use descriptive multi-word skill names (`post-core-update-recovery`, `channel-economics-analyzer`) over short verbs (`recovery`, `channels`). This is a deliberate trade-off: longer names are less autocomplete-friendly but clearer in search and discovery, and renaming would invalidate existing external references (Anthropic submission, dev.to article, awesome-list PR, MEMORY.md).

If a future plugin in the same marketplace needs shorter aliases, the `rescue` orchestrator can route them as subcommands (e.g. `/seo-rescue:rescue audit <url>` already aliases `/seo-rescue:seo-audit-free`).

## Release process

Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The current installable version is in `plugins/seo-rescue/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

**Before tagging:**

```bash
claude plugin validate plugins/seo-rescue   # plugin
claude plugin validate .                     # marketplace
```

Both must show `✔ Validation passed`. Tags pushed without validation cost a release cycle (see CHANGELOG.md for v0.2.0 and v0.2.1, both un-installable due to missing manifest-path and YAML-frontmatter checks). The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs the same checks on every push and PR, but local validation before `git tag` is the canonical gate.

After validation passes:

```bash
git tag -a v<X.Y.Z> -m "v<X.Y.Z> — short summary"
git push origin v<X.Y.Z>
gh release create v<X.Y.Z> --notes-file CHANGELOG-extract.md
```

## Security model

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). Highlights:

- All slugs validated via shared `safeSlug()` in `plugins/seo-rescue/lib/safe.js`
- Cache moved from world-writable `/tmp/` to per-user `~/.cache/seo-rescue/` (mode 0700, refused on symlink)
- Strict CSP meta tag on rendered PDF HTML (`frame-src 'none'; object-src 'none'`)
- Chrome subprocess via `spawnSync` with argv-array (no shell), isolated `--user-data-dir`
- Size caps via `safeReadFile()` on all external-input file reads
- No telemetry, no phone-home, no postinstall hooks, no `npm install`
