# Repository Context

You are working in a high-performance, highly-available distributed cache and infrastructure system.

Treat every implementation, bugfix, review, and design task as infrastructure engineering work, not CRUD work.
Performance, concurrency safety, memory safety, recovery correctness, and operational availability are repository-level
requirements.

Use the shared repository-local context under `.repo_context/`.

Read order:

1. `.repo_context/README.md`
2. `.repo_context/index.md`
3. `.repo_context/maintenance.md`
4. `.repo_context/generated/repo_index.md`
5. `.repo_context/modules/overview/engineering-principles.md`
6. relevant `.repo_context/modules/<domain>/*.md` or `.repo_context/playbooks/<category>/...`

Rules:

- source code is the final source of truth;
- `.repo_context/` is an index and memory layer, not a substitute for reading code;
- if touched module structure or behavior changed, update `.repo_context/` in the same task when practical;
- if context is stale, correct it instead of ignoring the mismatch.
- before adding new logic, search for existing helpers, utilities, status/error patterns, thread pools, persistence
  helpers, recovery paths, and test harnesses;
- identify hot-path, concurrency, ownership, persistence, recovery, and failover risk before making claims or edits;
- before claiming completion, use `.repo_context/playbooks/upkeep/ai-self-verification.md`.
