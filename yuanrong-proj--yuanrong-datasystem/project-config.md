# Repository Instructions

You are working in a high-performance, highly-available distributed cache and infrastructure system.

Treat every implementation, bugfix, review, and design task as infrastructure engineering work, not CRUD work.
Performance, concurrency safety, memory safety, recovery correctness, and operational availability are repository-level
requirements.

This repository keeps a shared AI context under `.repo_context/`.

Start here before large implementation, bugfix, review, or codebase Q&A tasks:

1. Read `.repo_context/README.md`.
2. Read `.repo_context/index.md`.
3. Read `.repo_context/maintenance.md`.
4. Read `.repo_context/generated/repo_index.md`.
5. Read `.repo_context/modules/overview/engineering-principles.md`.
6. Read the relevant file under `.repo_context/modules/<domain>/` or `.repo_context/playbooks/<category>/`.
7. Confirm important claims against the actual source before acting.

Rules:

- Source code is the final source of truth.
- If the touched module's responsibilities, structure, build path, or test path changed, update the relevant `.repo_context/` files in the same task when practical.
- If `.repo_context/` is stale, fix it rather than silently working around it.
- Keep context additions narrow, source-backed, and reusable.
- Before adding new logic, search for existing helpers, utilities, status/error patterns, thread pools, persistence
  helpers, recovery paths, and test harnesses.
- Identify whether the change touches a hot path. If it does, explicitly assess latency, throughput, lock contention,
  allocations, copies, cache locality, IO, and foreground impact from background work.
- For stateful changes, explicitly assess persistence, crash consistency, partial writes, startup rebuild, compaction,
  cleanup, idempotency, retry safety, and failover behavior.
- For shared state, document ownership, protection, lock ordering, visibility, and lifetime assumptions in the design or
  review notes.
- Prefer small, scoped changes that match existing style. Do not perform unrelated refactors or broad formatting churn.
- Before claiming completion, use `.repo_context/playbooks/upkeep/ai-self-verification.md`.
