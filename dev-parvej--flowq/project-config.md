# WordPress Dynamic Survey Plugin - Current Implementation

## What's Currently Implemented

### Core Plugin Structure
- WordPress plugin with proper activation/deactivation hooks
- Database migration system with custom tables
- Internationalization support (text domain: 'flowq')
- Security measures (nonce verification, capability checks)

### Question System
- **Single Question Type Only**: Hardcoded 'single_choice' type in `class-question-manager.php:62`
- Question CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, duplicate)
- Question fields: title, description, extra_message
- Questions ordered by ID (no custom ordering)

### Answer System
- Multiple answer options per question
- Answer fields: answer_text, answer_value, answer_order
- **Conditional Logic**: Each answer can specify `next_question_id` for branching
- **External Redirects**: Each answer can specify `redirect_url`
- **Skip Question Option**: Questions can be marked as skippable, allowing users to proceed without selecting an answer
- Answer reordering functionality

### Database Schema
Tables created:
- `flowq_surveys`
- `flowq_questions`
- `flowq_answers`
- `flowq_responses`
- `flowq_participants`
- `flowq_sessions`
- `flowq_templates`

### Admin Interface

   - Updated to use pre-fetched `question_count` from survey data array

2. **`includes/class-survey-manager.php`**:
   - Modified `get_surveys()` method signature to accept `include_question_count` parameter
   - Implemented LEFT JOIN query: `SELECT s.*, COUNT(q.id) as question_count FROM surveys s LEFT JOIN questions q ON s.id = q.survey_id GROUP BY s.id`
   - Updated `create_survey()` and `update_survey()` to use `wp_kses_post()` for form_subtitle
   - Added GROUP BY clause for correct aggregation

3. **`admin/class-admin.php`**:
   - Updated `display_all_surveys_page()` to pass `include_question_count => true` parameter
   - Changed form_subtitle sanitization from `sanitize_textarea_field()` to `wp_kses_post()`

**Key Code Patterns:**

- **Page Selection**: Use `get_pages()` with `post_status => 'publish'` for WordPress page lists
