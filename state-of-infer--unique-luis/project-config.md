# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Project Architecture

This is a React 19 application built with Vite that implements a car rental website with auction functionality. The project uses a feature-based architecture with Redux Toolkit for state management and Firebase for data persistence.

### Key Technologies
- **React 19** with React Router DOM v7 for routing
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management with multiple slices
- **Firebase/Firestore** for database operations
- **Vite** for build tooling and development
- **Axios** for API communication
- **Bootstrap 5** with custom styling

### State Management Architecture

The application uses Redux Toolkit with feature-based slices:

- `auth/userSlice` - User authentication and session management
- `modal/modalSlice` - Modal dialog state management  
- `registro/registroSlice` - User registration workflows
- `slideshow/slideshowSlice` - Image carousel management
- `subastaSlice/subastaSlice` - Auction functionality and bidding
- `busqueda/busquedaSlice` - Search and filtering logic
- `vender/venderSlide` - Car selling/listing functionality
- `loader/loaderSlice` - Loading states across the app

### API Layer

The application uses a custom API wrapper (`src/api/api.js`) with:
- `fetch()` - Authenticated requests with JWT tokens
- `fetchSinToken()` - Unauthenticated requests
- `postFile()` - File upload functionality
- `getFile()` - File download with authentication

### Component Structure

- **Layout Components**: `Header`, `Footer` provide consistent navigation
- **Page Components**: Route-based components in `src/pages/`
- **Section Components**: Reusable page sections (hero, testimonials, etc.)
- **Input Components**: Form controls with validation in `src/components/input/`
- **UI Components**: Utility components like `ScrollTop`, `Breadcrumb`

### Firebase Integration

Firebase is configured in `src/db/firebase.js` with Firestore for data persistence. The configuration is imported from `src/db/config/firebase.js`.

## Working with the Codebase

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature directory in `src/views/` for new functionality
2. Create Redux slice if state management is needed
3. Add API functions in `src/api/api.js` if backend integration required
4. Create components following the existing naming conventions
5. Update routing in `src/router/AppRouter.jsx` for new pages

### Router Architecture
The application uses a sophisticated routing system with authentication:

- **AppRouter**: Main router that handles authentication state and renders appropriate routes
- **Layout Components**: Provide consistent structure across the application
- **Route Protection**: PrivateRoute and PublicRoute components control access based on authentication
- **Authentication Flow**: Uses JWT tokens with automatic refresh functionality

### State Management Patterns
- Use Redux Toolkit `createSlice` for new state
- Async operations use `createAsyncThunk` in thunk files
- Access state via `useSelector` and dispatch via `useDispatch`

### API Integration
- Use `fetch()` for authenticated requests
