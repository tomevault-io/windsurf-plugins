# yiibu — the portable contract

**Read this if you are not Claude Code.** Codex, Antigravity, another model, a
plain script, a human: this file is the whole standard, and every rule in it is
a command you can run rather than advice you have to remember.

It sits at the repo root because that is where your tool looks for it. The
commands, however, run from the skill itself — start with:

```bash
cd skills/yiibu
```

The design rule behind that:

> **Quality lives in the executable checks, never in the agent driving them.**
> Anything that depends on an agent remembering, noticing, or being clever is
> not a standard — it is a hope. If a rule matters, it is a gate.

The proof is in the repo's own history: the same defects came back after being
documented in prose twice, and stopped only once code refused to proceed. So a
different model must be able to reach the same standard by running the same
commands — that is the bar this file exists to hold.

## 0. Check the machine once

```bash
python3 doctor.py
```

Needs `ffmpeg`, Pillow and numpy. The caption font is bundled. Hardware
encoding (`h264_videotoolbox`) is used when present and falls back to libx264
automatically, so a Linux clone works — slower, same output spec.

## 1. Read the standard BEFORE authoring anything

```bash
python3 gates.py --preflight
```

Prints the locked spec — font, caption sizes and minimum dwell, pill geometry,
cover rules, the hook and end-card requirements — straight out of
`house_style.json`, **which is the single source of truth**. Prose in SKILL.md
explains it; it does not define it. A project may override any key by writing
`WORK_DIR/house_style.local.json`, and every active override is printed, so an
exemption is visible instead of assumed.

## 2. Plan the length before cutting

```bash
python3 plan.py SOURCE_DIR --platform reels
```

Say the recommended number to the user before you cut. Length comes from
retention structure, not from how much footage exists.

## 3. Record the user's decisions — never default them

`WORK_DIR/decisions.json` is REQUIRED; gates fail without it.

```jsonc
{
  "loudness": {"value": "original", "why": "..."},   // or -14LUFS, needs a why
  "captions": "on",                                  // or deferred, needs a why
  "end_card": {"value": "on"}                        // off needs a why
}
```

## 4. Transcribe, then PROOF-READ

```bash
python3 proofread.py WORK_DIR/words.json --media CLIP.mp4
```

Exit 1 means do not caption from this transcript. Two failures it catches that
nothing downstream can:

- **Prompt echo** — on noisy audio Whisper returns your `initial_prompt` as the
  transcript, at ordinary-looking probabilities. It would ship as a quote the
  person never said. **Do not pass an `initial_prompt`.**
- **Decoder loop** — a phrase repeating forever on near-silent audio.

Then: a caption that QUOTES speech must match the audio under it word for word.
Anything you cannot confirm goes in an authored style (`Note`), never a verbatim
one (`Speech`). Tightening a quote to read better is fabrication.

## 5. Build with the proven primitives

```bash
python3 build_lint.py YOUR_BUILD.py     # before running it, and after editing it
```

Compose `modules/buildkit.py` (`prep_segment`, `concat`, `overlay_pills`,
`burn_subtitles`, `duck_mix`, `final_encode`, …). Each function encodes a trap
that has cost real build time. Writing a raw ffmpeg graph for something
buildkit covers is the known failure mode. Importing buildkit self-lints the
calling script, so an antipattern refuses to start rather than stalling later.

Two that matter for hand-off:

- `final_encode(..., delivery=True)` is the default and uses a delivery
  bitrate. At the intermediate bitrate a 90-second reel came out **211 MiB**.
- `duck_mix(..., speech_spans=[(start, end), …])` when speakers sit at
  different distances from the mic. The automatic mode derives its threshold
  from the material, but an explicit list is deterministic and inspectable.

## 6. Ship BOTH versions, and gate every render

```bash
python3 verify.py WORK_DIR --output FINAL.mp4    # advisory
python3 gates.py  FINAL.mp4 --work-dir WORK_DIR  # BLOCKING
```

A music version and a `-nomusic` version always ship, plus `cover.jpg`, at the
project's first level.

| exit | meaning | what to say |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | shippable | it passes the gates |
| `1` | something is broken | what failed; do not hand over |
| `2` | nothing broken, gates **deferred** by a recorded decision | it is **not finished**, and which parts are outstanding |

**The rule that outranks every threshold:**

> Do not reason about whether a measurement is acceptable.
> A number outside the threshold is a failure **even when you can explain it**.

A silent ending shipped twice; both times the level was measured, seen, and
talked away. Explaining a number is not checking it.

Every run appends to `WORK_DIR/build_log.jsonl` and rewrites `BUILD_LOG.md`,
including how many attempts it took and which gates rejected which one.

## 7. Look at what the gates cannot see

```bash
python3 coverage.py WORK_DIR      # also printed under every gates.py run
```

Gates check for **defects**. They are structurally blind to:
