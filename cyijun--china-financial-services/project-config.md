# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A Claude plugin marketplace plus Managed Agents (CMA) cookbook for China A-share equity research, built on Tushare Pro. There is no application runtime here — the deliverables are **manifests** (`plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `agent.yaml`) and **prompt assets** (`agents/*.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`). All "code" is glue: lint, sync, deploy, dry-run.

Outputs are analyst drafts staged for human sign-off. Never investment advice. Skill prose enforces this; do not weaken those guardrails when editing.

## Common commands

```bash
# Lint & cross-reference everything (YAML/JSON parse, frontmatter, refs, drift, depth)
python3 scripts/check.py

# Re-vendor agent-plugin bundled skills from vertical-plugins/ (source of truth)
python3 scripts/sync-agent-skills.py

# Re-sync hooks/ from the source-of-truth plugin to every other plugin
python3 scripts/sync-hooks.py

# Dry-run all cookbooks — proves they resolve to a well-formed POST /v1/agents body
bash scripts/test-cookbooks.sh

# Dry-run a single cookbook (prints resolved JSON bodies)
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh <slug> --dry-run

# Live deploy a cookbook (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + jq + zip + pyyaml)
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh china-market-researcher
```

`check.py` and `test-cookbooks.sh` together form the CI gate: run both before pushing manifest or skill changes. Tushare-using skills require `TUSHARE_TOKEN` at runtime (not at lint time).

## Architecture: two plugin shapes, one source of truth

The marketplace at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` ships four plugins in two shapes:

- **`plugins/vertical-plugins/<name>/`** (`financial-analysis`, `equity-research`) — flat collections of skills. **This is the source of truth for any skill that lives here.**
- **`plugins/agent-plugins/<name>/`** (`china-market-researcher`, `china-model-builder`) — a named end-to-end workflow with `agents/<name>.md` plus a `skills/` directory of **vendored copies** of the skills it uses.

The vendored copies must stay byte-identical to the vertical source. `check.py` runs `filecmp.dircmp` and fails on drift; `sync-agent-skills.py` is the only sanctioned way to update them. **Edit a skill in `vertical-plugins/`, then run sync — never edit a bundled copy directly.** Agent-plugin-only skills (no vertical source, e.g. `pptx-author`, `xlsx-author`) are allowed; `check.py` warns but does not fail.

`agent.md` prose references skill names in backticks (e.g. `` `tushare-data` ``); `check.py` requires every such reference to exist in the agent's own `skills/` bundle.

## Architecture: hooks — one source of truth, copied everywhere

Hooks live at `<plugin>/hooks/hooks.json` (plugin root, sibling to `skills/`). `financial-analysis/hooks/` is the **source of truth** for all year-guard hooks. Every other plugin receives a byte-identical copy so that year validation works regardless of which plugin a user installs.

`scripts/sync-hooks.py` has the source of truth hard-coded (`plugins/vertical-plugins/financial-analysis/hooks`). It copies it to every other plugin, overwriting any stale copy and skipping already-identical dirs. **Edit hooks in `financial-analysis/`, then run `sync-hooks.py` — never edit a copied hooks directory directly.**

## Architecture: the cookbook → CMA pipeline

Each cookbook is `managed-agent-cookbooks/<slug>/{agent.yaml, README.md, steering-examples.json}`. The `agent.yaml` is a **convenience manifest**, not a CMA payload. `scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh` resolves it into the flat `POST /v1/agents` body the API expects:

| Manifest sugar | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `system: { file: ../../path.md, append: "..." }` | inlined into `system: "<string>"` |
| `skills: [{ path: ./skill }]` | each dir zipped, uploaded to `POST /v1/skills`, replaced with `{type:custom, skill_id, version:latest}` |
| `skills: [{ from_plugin: ../../plugins/.../<name> }]` | expanded into one `path:` entry per `skills/*` under that plugin |
| `callable_agents: [{ manifest: ./sub.yaml }]` | sub-cookbook deployed first (recursively), referenced by returned agent id |
| `output_schema:` block on a subagent | **stripped** from payload; intended for harness-side validation via `scripts/validate.py` |

Two invariants enforced by `test-cookbooks.sh`:
1. **Depth-1 only.** A subagent (anything not the last entry in the recursion) must not declare `callable_agents`.
2. **Non-empty `system`.** After file-inlining and `append`, the body must be a non-empty string.

The deploy script uses tool type `agent_toolset_20260401` and beta header `managed-agents-2026-04-01`. Skills upload uses a separate `skills-2025-10-02` beta header. Cookbooks default to `claude-opus-4-7`.

`${VAR}` substitution in `agent.yaml` only accepts characters in `[A-Za-z0-9._/:@-]` — `yaml2json` exits if the env value contains anything else. Don't try to inject prose via env.

## Cross-agent handoffs

`scripts/orchestrate.py` is **reference only** — shape of an event loop, not a production engine. Replace with your firm's workflow infra (Temporal, Airflow, etc.). What it documents:
