## Development Commands

```bash
composer test          # Run tests (PHPUnit)
composer format        # Fix code style (PHP CS Fixer)
composer analyse       # Static analysis (PHPStan level 5)
```

Individual tests: `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/AgentTest.php` or `--filter testMethodName`

## Architecture

**Layered Foundation**:
```
RAG ─────► extends Agent ─────► built on Workflow
                              │
Tools ◄───────────────────────┤
Providers ◄───────────────────┤
Chat ◄────────────────────────┴──► shared across all
```

**Workflow** is the foundation. **Agent** composes workflow nodes for AI interactions. **RAG** extends Agent with document retrieval. All share **Chat** for messaging and **Providers** for AI backends.

## Modules

| Module | Purpose                                                       | Dependencies |

## Context Discovery

Read module-specific `AGENTS.md` files when working on that area:

- Working with workflows/interruptions? → `src/Workflow/AGENTS.md`
- Working with agents/chat/stream? → `src/Agent/AGENTS.md`
- Working with messages/history? → `src/Chat/AGENTS.md`
- Adding/modifying AI providers? → `src/Providers/AGENTS.md`
- Creating tools/toolkits? → `src/Tools/AGENTS.md`
- Working with RAG/vectors? → `src/RAG/AGENTS.md`
- CLI commands/code generation? → `src/Console/AGENTS.md`
- AI evaluation/testing? → `src/Evaluation/AGENTS.md`

## Code Standards

- Strict types: `declare(strict_types=1)`
- PSR-12 formatting
- PHPStan level 5
- 100% type coverage (params, returns, properties)
- PHP 8.1+ features (enums, constructor promotion)
- Use **protected** visibility for non-public properties and methods (never private)

## Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
