# Reigh: Working Rules (read first)

## Docs (consult before editing cross-cutting code)
- **Cross-cutting** = spans multiple tools, or touches core tables/storage/auth/billing.
- Start at `../structure.md` (collection-level, links to sub-docs). Deep dives live in `../docs/structure_detail/`.
- **Read the relevant sub-doc before editing** (all in `../docs/structure_detail/` unless noted):
  - *Data & persistence:* Settings → `settings_system.md` · Per-pair data → `per_pair_data_persistence.md` · Data fetching → `data_fetching.md` · DB/RPCs/storage → `db_and_storage.md` · Storage/uploads → `storage_uploads.md`
  - *Infrastructure:* Task creation → `unified_task_creation.md` · Workers → `task_worker_lifecycle.md` · Edge Functions → `edge_functions.md` · Realtime → `realtime_system.md` · Payments → `auto_topup_system.md`
  - *Frontend:* Architecture → `frontend_architecture.md` · Shared utilities → `shared_utilities.md` · Design/motion → `design_motion_guidelines.md` · Auth → `auth_system.md` · Routing → `routing_and_navigation.md` · Performance → `performance_system.md` · Image loading → `image_loading_system.md`
  - *Operations:* Debugging → `../debugging.md` (collection-level, cross-repo) · Error handling → `error_handling.md` · Deployment → `deployment_and_migration_guide.md` · Refactoring → `refactoring_patterns.md` · Video travel tool → `tool_video_travel.md` · Code quality → `docs/code_quality_audit.md`
- **Multiple docs apply?** Start with most specific (e.g., `image_loading` before `performance`).
- **New feature?** Check `adding_new_tool.md` for tool pattern; `structure.md` for where things live.
- **Debugging a flow?** Trace: UI → hook → task creation (`unified_task_creation.md`) → worker (`task_worker_lifecycle.md`) → `complete_task` edge function.

## Supabase safety (non-negotiable)
- Prefer Edge Functions/DB triggers for atomic/elevated/sensitive/guaranteed work.
- Deploy functions individually: `npx supabase functions deploy <name> --project-ref wczysqzxlwdndgxitrvc`
- Migrations: `npx supabase db push --linked` (**never** `db reset --linked`)
- SQL for editor: wrap results in `SELECT json_agg(results) FROM (...) results;`

## UI conventions
- Toasts: **errors only** (no “success” toasts for task creation).
- Don’t create new `*.md` unless explicitly requested.

## Prefer existing patterns
- Reuse shared components/hooks in `src/shared/` before creating new ones.
- Tools follow `src/tools/[name]/{pages,components,hooks,settings.ts}` (see `adding_new_tool.md`).
- UI: shadcn (`src/shared/components/ui/`), lucide icons, **never hardcode colors** (use `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, etc.). Responsive: Tailwind + `@container`.

## Key concepts / correctness
- Generations vs variants: generations are gallery items; variants are per-generation alternates; use `based_on` for lineage.
- **Generation IDs**: Use `getGenerationId(media)` from `shared/lib/mediaTypeHelpers.ts` instead of inline `media.generation_id || media.id`. Handles variants, metadata, and null safely.
- Shots data: use `ShotsContext` via `useShots()`; shot images via `useShotImages(shotId)`.
- React Query: invalidate after mutations; scope invalidations where possible.

## Review discipline
- After changes: ensure nothing out-of-scope was deleted/edited.
- Flag briefly (don't derail): duplication, giant components (>300 LOC), prop drilling (3+ levels), mixed concerns, inconsistent patterns, missing error handling.
- Anti-patterns and quality standards: see `docs/code_quality_audit.md`. Core principle: every change should make the codebase smaller or more explicit.

## Context hooks
- Required-provider hooks must throw when their context is missing. Do not hide missing providers behind default objects with no-op setters.
- Only add a `Safe` hook variant for genuinely optional consumers, and justify that callsite inline.
- Motivating incident: the media-lightbox edit textarea dropped typing because `EMPTY_FORM` setters were no-ops, so missing context failed silently instead of crashing where the provider was absent.

## Thoroughness over speed
- **Don't half-measure.** When reviewing/fixing a batch of items, read every one. Don't blanket-categorize based on metadata alone.
- **Wontfix requires justification.** Every wontfix must include a specific reason for THIS item — not a generic category label. If you can't explain why it's fine, you haven't read it.
- **Fix > wontfix.** The default action is fixing. Only wontfix when fixing would make things worse or the finding is a false positive.
- **Don't game metrics.** Wontfixing to inflate a score is worse than leaving items open. The goal is code quality, not numbers.
- **When the user asks for a complete job, do a complete job.** Don't propose half-measures or shortcuts unless the user explicitly says they want speed over thoroughness.

## Debugging
- See `../debugging.md` (collection-level) for cross-repo debugging router, CLI commands, and decision table.
- **Use consistent tags**: `console.log('[MyTag] message', data)` — filter with `debug.py logs --latest --tag MyTag`.
- Debug logs are dev-only (stripped in prod), so temporary instrumentation is OK.
