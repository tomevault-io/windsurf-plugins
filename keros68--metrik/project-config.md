# Prototype Instructions

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

## Durable product decisions

- The selected visual source is Product Design ideation option 2, saved at `design/reference-option-2.png`.
- The interface should feel Apple-like through restraint, typography, material depth, spacing, and motion; do not imitate Apple branding or proprietary screens.
- The default desktop form is a compact approximately 380 x 440 widget. Full analytics remain available through a one-click expanded view; pinning above other windows is opt-in, not forced.
- Gemini CLI is explicitly out of scope. The initial adapters are Codex and Claude Code; future agents must use the adapter contract.
- Statistics must distinguish official quota, locally parsed usage, and estimated cost. Never present estimates as official billing.
- Never synthesize a comparison curve or silently replace a failed desktop read with demo numbers. Missing or stale data must be labeled explicitly.
- The product is local-first. Multi-device sync is optional and must not upload prompts, conversation text, credentials, or raw tool output.
- On Windows, compact transparency must come from a native whole-window system backdrop; do not simulate glass by only lowering the opacity of Metrik's own background. The expanded window stays opaque and owns its light/dark theme independently.
