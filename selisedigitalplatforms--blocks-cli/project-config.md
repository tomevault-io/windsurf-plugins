# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This is the AI entry point for the repository.

## Workflow

1. Understand the user's objective.
2. If the task involves building or modifying a Blocks application (not this monorepo's own source), use the installed `blocks` CLI and package guides from the consumer app context. If project/login state is unknown, start with `docs/AI_ROUTING_GUIDE.md`.
3. If the starting point is unclear, read `docs/AI_ROUTING_GUIDE.md` before choosing a package guide or source path.
4. Read the relevant package `AGENT_GUIDE.md` when the task touches a package's own behavior in depth.
5. Inspect the existing implementation before making changes.
6. Make the smallest correct change.
7. Verify the result before finishing.

## Rules

* Reuse existing architecture, packages, and patterns.
* Do not duplicate business logic.
* Respect package boundaries.
* Use the CLI or SDK instead of reimplementing functionality.
* Create Blocks projects only through `blocks projects create` (single `dev` environment, after the user agrees - it accepts the Blocks terms on their behalf), never through raw project APIs. Adding environments to an existing project is portal-only.
* Never expose secrets or credentials.
* Ask for approval before destructive or cloud-mutating operations.
* After changing any CLI endpoint or any `blocks-*/server` contract, run `npm run verify:endpoints` in `blocks-cli/` -- it checks every CLI route+verb against the checked-out service controllers (this is how a stale `/api` base and a wrong Storage/Delete verb were caught). It verifies routes only; DTO field names, FromQuery/FromBody binding and replace-vs-patch semantics still need the server source read, and any skill prose stating endpoint behavior must be re-checked at the same time (0.4.1: two skills went stale when blocks-iam moved).
* Most Blocks `save`/`update` endpoints are full-record replacements, not patches: a field left out of the body is stored as its default (false, 0, empty), not kept. Every CLI save/update that targets one reads the current record and merges the flags over it (`src/lib/merge-current.ts`); a new such command must first check the server source (the endpoint may be a sparse patch, like `POST /users/{id}` since blocks-iam retired its full-replace body), and must check the GET's field names against the POST DTO because they can differ (`signup-settings` GET says `defaultRolesForNewUser`, POST binds `defaultRolesForNewUserOnSignUp`). Confirm every write by re-reading state after `--yes`.
* `iam users access grant` replaces a user's whole role list and permission list for one organization when a non-empty list is passed; pass the complete set the user should end up with, and know which `--organization-id` resolves. `iam users update` patches profile fields only -- roles, permissions and MFA state moved to their own endpoints, and the CLI refuses them there.
* Verify changes before considering the task complete.

## Working on Blocks apps vs. working on this monorepo

Two different jobs land here, and the rules below apply only to the second one:

- **Building/modifying a Blocks application** (the common case for an external user): treat this monorepo as a black box - work entirely through the installed `blocks` CLI and `@seliseblocks/client` package. Do not read this repo's `blocks-cli`/`blocks-client` source to figure out package behavior; use `blocks --help`, `blocks doctor --json`, and each package's own `AGENT_GUIDE.md` instead - a real consumer only ever has the installed packages, never this source tree.
- **Maintaining, publishing, or debugging the `blocks-cli`/`blocks-client` packages themselves**: this exception doesn't apply - read the source normally, that's the task.

## Monorepo-only meta-rules (apply regardless of which job above)

* Never open, read, print, or otherwise expose the CLI's local storage files (its config/token/secret files on disk, wherever `blocks doctor --json` says they live) or anything inside them - client ids, root tenant id, account names, tokens. Only ever interact with them through `blocks` commands.

* Gateway paths are `/<service>/v4/<Controller>/<action>` -- never put `api` after the version segment (`/release/v4/Build/repos-list`, not `/release/v4/api/...`; the gateway answers the latter with an HTML error page). The `/api/...` prefix seen in the portal clients is their same-origin dev-proxy base, not a gateway path. The only legitimate `/api/` URLs in the CLI are the two IdP-host OIDC calls (`oidcUrl` + `/api/oidc/token`, `/api/oidc/device_authorization`), which do not go through the gateway. Check a new path against the service's `server/Api/Controllers` `[Route]`/`[Http*]` attributes; `grep -rn v4/api blocks-cli/src` must stay empty.

## Documentation Order

1. `docs/AI_ROUTING_GUIDE.md` - the routing guide when the agent can start from any state.
2. `<package>/AGENT_GUIDE.md` - exact flags, defaults, and failure codes for one package.
3. Source code - only when maintaining the CLI/SDK packages themselves (see above).

Use the highest-level document that answers the current task. Do not duplicate instructions between documentation layers.
