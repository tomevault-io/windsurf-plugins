This is an extremely important rule for client performance.

This is an example of how we want data to be fetched:

```tsx
function StatsCard() {
 return <Suspense=fallback{<Skeleton/>}>
          <StatsCardInternal/>
        </Suspense>
};

function StatsCardInternal(){
    const data = await getData();
    return <div>{...data}</div>;
};
```

The reason this format is important is because it allows us to have a fallback UI while the data is loading, and a non-blocking experience for the user.

Use react-query for data fetching and revalidation.

Use the `useQuery` hook to fetch data.

Use the `useMutation` hook to mutate data.

Use the `useQueryClient` hook to get the query client.

Use the `useQueryState` hook to get the query state.
