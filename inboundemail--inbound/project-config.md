# Changelog Management Guide

## Overview
The project uses an MDX-based changelog system located at `/changelog`. All changelog entries are stored as MDX files in the [app/changelog/entries](mdc:app/changelog/entries) directory.

## Creating Changelog Entries

### File Naming Convention
Use date-based naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.mdx`
Example: `2025-01-23-lambda-multi-recipient-fix.mdx`

### Required Frontmatter
Every changelog entry MUST include the following frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: Your Feature Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
version: X.Y.Z
summary: Brief one-line description of the change
---
```

### Version Numbering
Follow semantic versioning (SemVer):
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major overhauls
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, significant improvements
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, small improvements

### Content Structure
1. **Overview/Problem**: Describe what issue this addresses or what's new
2. **What Changed**: List the specific changes made
3. **Technical Details** (if applicable): Code examples, configuration changes
4. **Impact**: How this affects users
5. **Migration Guide** (if needed): Steps users need to take

### Example Entry
```mdx
---
title: Webhook Retry Logic Implementation
date: 2025-01-24
version: 1.9.1
summary: Added automatic retry logic for failed webhook deliveries with exponential backoff
---

## Overview
We've implemented robust retry logic to ensure webhook deliveries succeed even during temporary network issues.

## What Changed
- Failed webhooks now retry up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload
- New monitoring metrics in dashboard

## Technical Details
Webhooks now support configuration options:
\`\`\`json
{
  "retryAttempts": 3,
  "retryDelay": 1000
}
\`\`\`

## Impact
No action required - fully backward compatible.
```

## Changelog Page Features

### Main Page ([/changelog](mdc:app/changelog/page.tsx))
- Timeline visualization with connected dots
- Sorted by date (newest first)
- Shows title, date, version, and summary
- Links to full entry details

### Entry Pages ([/changelog/[slug]](mdc:app/changelog/[slug]/page.tsx))
- Full MDX rendering with syntax highlighting
- Custom styled components matching app theme
- Back navigation to main changelog

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Write user-focused summaries
- Include code examples for technical changes
- Mention if changes are breaking
- Add migration guides when needed
- Use clear, descriptive titles

### DON'T:
- Use internal jargon without explanation
- Forget to test MDX rendering
- Skip the summary field
- Use inconsistent version numbers

## Adding to Navigation
The changelog is already linked in:
- [SiteHeader](mdc:components/site-header.tsx) - For public pages
- [MarketingHeader](mdc:components/marketing-header.tsx) - For marketing pages

## MDX Components
The changelog supports all standard markdown plus:
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables
- Images (automatically styled)
- Links (styled with primary color)
- Lists (bullets and numbered)
- Blockquotes

## Deployment
Changelog entries are automatically included in the build. No additional configuration needed - just add the MDX file to the entries directory.
