When writing code, always apply the following style guide:

1. Use variant props for component styling — never apply custom colors, sizes, or border-radius directly. `className` is only for spacing and layout.
2. Always use CSS color variables from `global.css` — never hardcode colors.
3. Default theme is light mode; all new styles go in `globals.css` under light mode.
