Engineering rules for this repository. These override any default behavior — follow them exactly as written.

## 1. Config-like constants live in the config, single-sourced — never scattered literals

A tunable, operational value — a threshold, budget, size/limit, count, timeout/interval, ratio, schedule, model name or LLM param, port/host/url, retry count, cache/state path — belongs in the config (`src/kapso/config.yaml`, loaded via `load_config()` / `load_mode_config()` in `src/kapso/core/config.py`), read at the call site or threaded to it. Do NOT bury such a value as a literal in a module, and NEVER re-hardcode a default that duplicates an existing config value: a copied literal silently drifts from its config home — the exact bug class this rule exists to kill.

When a value genuinely needs a module-level or dataclass default (for direct construction / tests), SOURCE it from the canonical config — not a fresh literal — so there is ONE source of truth and a default change can never leave two copies out of sync; the live per-run override still threads from `load_config()`.

This does NOT cover STRUCTURAL constants — regex / format / prompt strings, JSON or enum keys, sentinels, array indices, version strings, HTTP status codes, math constants — which are not user knobs and stay in code. Companion to Rule 3: Rule 3 says config comes from the file (never an env var); this rule says config-like values must actually BE in the config, not duplicated as literals next to it.

## 2. No try/except, no fallbacks — validate explicitly, fail loud

No try/except anywhere in the code, and no fallback-style error swallowing. Validate inputs with explicit checks (`isinstance`, `.exists()`, presence checks, regex) and let genuine errors propagate. A missing file may return a documented default; a corrupt one must raise. This is strict even for parsing on-disk JSON/JSONL and model JSON output: a malformed line raises, it is not skipped.

## 3. No configuration via environment variables

All configuration is read from the config file (`config.yaml`, passed explicitly via `--config` / `config_path`), never from environment variables. Never read `os.environ` / `getenv`. Secrets are not read by our code — provider SDKs read their own credentials; the config file holds no secrets.

## 4. All imports at the top of the file

Every `import` / `from … import` goes at the top of its module — no function-local or lazy imports. To keep the package installable without heavy optional deps, isolate those deps in modules that are only loaded when that feature runs, and have the core CLI launch them as subprocesses rather than importing them.

## 5. Naming — self-contained, never index-style

Code identifiers must be descriptive of what they do. NEVER use index-style names (M1/M2/…, C18, etc.) in code (functions, classes, modules, vars). Docstrings/comments may cite a design doc's index names for provenance ("M4 §4.1"), but code's own names stay descriptive.

## 6. Never truncate a message bound for an LLM call — above all a user message

Any content that goes INTO a model prompt must be passed in FULL. NEVER clip it with a character cap (`text[:N]`), a "first non-blank line", a "head" slice, or any other length limit on the way to an LLM call. This is strictest for the user's own messages (prompts, pasted code/errors): the model must see the whole thing — intent and detail do not always live in the first N characters. This covers every prompt-building path (search strategies, researcher, knowledge-base prompts). A model-produced ABSTRACTION (e.g. a judge's one-line label) is fine — that is the model's own summary, not us cutting the input. If a prompt is genuinely too large for the context window, WINDOW it (segment into multiple complete calls) or bubble the problem up — never silently truncate. Length caps for non-LLM purposes — display (dashboards, ledgers), git short-shas, id/slug minting, prefix classifiers that only inspect a head — are allowed; the rule is specifically about data crossing into a model call.

## 7. No backward compatibility during development — implement the new design cleanly

This codebase is pre-release and still in active design flux. When a design decision changes, implement the NEW design directly — do NOT keep the old behavior alive for compatibility. No migration shims, deprecated aliases, dual code paths, "support both the old and new format" branches, or versioned fallbacks: delete the superseded code/format and move its callers and tests to the new shape. Prior on-disk state written under an earlier design may be re-derived or discarded — there are no external consumers to protect yet. Backward compatibility becomes a concern only once we ship; until then the codebase tracks the current design with no legacy weight.

## 8. Commit after each feature change
