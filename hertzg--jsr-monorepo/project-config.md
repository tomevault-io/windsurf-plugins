# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Deno monorepo published to JSR (jsr.io) containing binary structure
encoding/decoding libraries and related utilities. The core package is
`@hertzg/binstruct`, which provides type-safe binary data serialization with
full TypeScript support. Additional packages implement format-specific decoders
(PNG, WAV, Ethernet) and utilities (WireGuard configuration, CLI tools).

## Essential Commands

### Testing and Linting (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS run these commands from project root before completing ANY coding
task:**

```bash
# Run from project root - MANDATORY final check before completing work
deno task lint
deno task test
```

Both commands must pass with exit code 0 before any task is considered complete.

### Development Commands (Workspace Level)

For faster feedback during active development, run in individual workspace
directories:

```bash
# Quick feedback loop during development
deno test
deno test --doc
deno lint
```

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Coverage reports
deno task cov              # View coverage summary
deno task cov:gen          # Generate lcov coverage
deno task cov:view         # View HTML coverage report
```

## Monorepo Structure

### Workspace Organization

- **Root**: Contains shared `import_map.json` and workspace configuration in
  `deno.json`
- **Packages**: Each workspace has its own `deno.json` with name, version, and
  exports
- **Publishing**: All packages follow JSR publishing conventions

### Workspaces

All packages are located in the `packages/` directory:

- `packages/binstruct` - Core binary structure encoding/decoding library
- `packages/binstruct-cli` - CLI tools for binary structure operations
- `packages/binstruct-ethernet` - Ethernet frame parsing
- `packages/binstruct-png` - PNG file format support
- `packages/binstruct-wav` - WAV audio file format support
- `packages/wg-keys` - WireGuard key management
- `packages/wg-ini` - INI file parsing
- `packages/wg-conf` - WireGuard configuration handling
- `packages/routeros-api` - MikroTik RouterOS API client
- `packages/tplink-api` - TP-Link Router API client
- `packages/mymagti-api` - MyMagti API client
- `packages/bx` - Binary hex string utilities
- `packages/ip` - IPv4/CIDR utilities
- `packages/crc` - CRC checksum utilities
- `packages/xhb` - HomeBank XHB file parse/serialize

## Core Architecture

### Binstruct Library Design

The `@hertzg/binstruct` package is built around three fundamental concepts:

1. **Coders**: Objects that implement both `encode` and `decode` methods
   - Identified by `kCoderKind` symbol to avoid string comparisons
   - Generic over the decoded type: `Coder<TDecoded>`
   - Always return `[value, bytesRead]` from decode operations

2. **Context System**: Context objects flow through encode/decode operations
   - Contains `direction` ("encode" or "decode")
   - Uses `kCtxRefs` symbol for internal reference storage
   - Avoids global state - all operations are context-aware
   - Created via `createContext(direction)` helper

3. **Reference System**: Enables self-referential and circular structures
   - `ref()` creates reference values for field-to-field dependencies
   - `computedRef()` creates computed references from multiple values
   - References stored in context via WeakMap for memory efficiency

4. **Single-Pass Processing**: All encoding/decoding operations work in a single
   forward pass
   - Fields are processed in declaration order (top to bottom)
   - References can only access **earlier** fields (forward-only references)
   - No backward references - fields cannot depend on values that come later
   - Structure field order matters - organize fields in dependency order
   - Enables optimal performance without multiple buffer passes or lookahead

### Refiner Pattern

The `refine()` function transforms decoded values into refined types:

```typescript ignore
// Transforms arrays to/from formatted strings
const macAddr = refine(array(u8be(), 6), {
  refine: (arr: number[]) =>
    arr.map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0")).join(":"),
  unrefine: (mac: string) => mac.split(":").map((hex) => parseInt(hex, 16)),
});
```

Used extensively in format-specific packages (PNG, Ethernet) to convert between
binary and domain-specific representations.

## Dependency Management

### Critical Rules

- **NEVER** use `deps.ts` for dependency management
- **ALL** dependencies defined in root `import_map.json`
- Use bare imports throughout (e.g., `@std/assert`, `@hertzg/binstruct`)
- When **NOT** referencing public methods use `./something.ts` relative imports
- `node:` imports are allowed
- Import validation enforced by `deno task lint:import-map`

### Updating Dependencies

When updating dependency versions in `import_map.json`, the `lint:deps` check
will fail because it uses snapshots to track dependency versions. This is
expected behavior, not a breaking change. To fix:

```bash
deno run -A _tools/check_deps.ts --update
```

This updates the `_deps.snap` files to reflect the new dependency versions.

### Correct Import Patterns

```typescript ignore
// ✅ Correct - Bare imports from import_map.json
import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert";
import { struct } from "@hertzg/binstruct";

// ❌ Incorrect - NO deps.ts files
import { assertEquals } from "./deps.ts";
```

## Code Standards

### No Defensive Programming

- Assume users provide adequate buffer sizes
- Misuse causes undefined behavior - this is intentional
- Write comprehensive JSDoc instead of runtime checks
- Fail fast with meaningful errors only for critical validation

### Performance First

- Use `DataView` for binary operations
- Implement explicit endianness support (big-endian, little-endian)
- Use symbols for internal identifiers (avoid string comparisons)
- Context-aware operations enable efficient testing without global state

### Module Organization

- Named exports only (enables tree-shaking)
- Main `mod.ts` has comprehensive module-level JSDoc with `@module` tag
- All exported files must be treated as if it was the `mod.ts` of the package
- Place types alongside implementation (no separate `types.ts`)
- Prefer functions over classes
- Export types with `export type` for type-only exports

### Feature Implementation Guidelines

- **CRITICAL:** Make MINIMAL CHANGES to existing patterns and structures.
- **CRITICAL:** Preserve existing naming conventions and file organization.
- Follow project's established architecture and component patterns.
- Use existing utility functions and avoid duplicating functionality.

## Documentation Requirements

### JSDoc Standards

**ALL exported members MUST have JSDoc documentation** including:

- Description of functionality
- `@param` tags for all parameters
- `@returns` tags for return values
- `@example` blocks with executable assertions
- `@template` tags for generic types

### Example Quality

- Examples MUST be executable and use `assert*` functions
- **AVOID** `console.log` and comments in examples
- Examples are tested during `deno task test`
- Use realistic data demonstrating real-world usage
- Show both encoding and decoding operations
- Verify data integrity with assertions
- Use `// deno-fmt-ignore` to preserve formatting of byte arrays and binary data
  when specific formatting aids readability

Example structure:

````typescript ignore
/**
 * Function description
 *
 * @param param Description
 * @returns Return value description
 *
 * @example Brief example description
 * ```ts ignore
 * import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert";
 * import { func } from "@hertzg/package";
 *
 * // Setup
 * const result = func(input);
 *
 * // Assertions
 * assertEquals(result, expected);
 * ```
 */
````

## Testing Standards

### Test Organization

- Use `Deno.test()` with descriptive names
- Group related tests logically
- Test positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases and error conditions

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function testing with edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and data flow
3. **Round-trip Tests**: Essential for binary encoding/decoding - verify data
   integrity
4. **JSDoc Examples**: Treated as executable tests

### Assertion Patterns

```typescript ignore
// Data integrity
assertEquals(decodedValue, originalValue);
// Note: Only when encode / decode is symmetrical (this is not always the case)
assertEquals(bytesRead, bytesWritten);

// Error handling
assertThrows(() => invalidOperation(), SpecificError);
await assertRejects(async () => await asyncInvalidOperation(), SpecificError);
```

## Workflow

### Development Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run workspace-level commands for quick feedback (`deno test`, `deno lint`)
3. Fix issues and iterate
4. **Complete all code changes**
5. **Run `deno task lint` from project root**
6. Fix any linting issues
7. **Run `deno task test` from project root**
8. Fix any test failures
9. Repeat steps 5-8 until both commands pass
10. **Only then consider the task complete**

### Quality Gates

Both `deno task lint` and `deno task test` must pass before:

- Completing any coding task
- Committing code changes
- Considering work production-ready

### Commit Message Rules

- Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): summary`; these messages
  are consumed by Release Please.
- Only `feat`, `fix`, or `chore` types are allowed.
- A scope is mandatory and must consist solely of package names; use commas to
  list multiple packages.
- Release Please uses file paths to determine which packages are affected, and
  commit types to determine version bump level.
- Commit messages are used to generate the changelog—write concise, user-facing
  summaries.

#### Breaking Changes

When a commit introduces a breaking change, append `!` after the scope and
include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body. Release Please uses this
to trigger a major version bump and generate the correct changelog entry.

```
feat(@hertzg/ip)!: auto-unwrap IPv4-mapped IPv6 in parseIp

BREAKING CHANGE: parseIp("::ffff:192.168.1.1") now returns a number instead of bigint.
```

#### Committing and Pushing

- Commit in reasonable, logical chunks — group related changes, separate
  unrelated ones.
- Always flag breaking changes with `!` and `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer so Release
  Please detects the correct version bump.
- Push after committing unless told otherwise.

#### Commit Message Examples

- ✅ `feat(@hertzg/binstruct): link submodule docs to jsr pages`
- ✅ `feat(@binstruct/png): fixed the png idat chunk parsing`
- ✅ `feat(@hertzg/ip)!: rename parse functions` (breaking change)
- ❌ `feat(hertzg/binstruct): link submodule docs to jsr pages`
- ❌ `feat(binstruct): bla bla`
- ❌ `feat(@nonexistent/pacakgename): bla bla`

#### Valid Commit Scopes

Commit scopes must match the `name` property in each workspace's `deno.json`.
The CI pipeline fails if scopes are wrong, and the only recovery is to rebase
and reword commits—avoid this by double-checking scopes before committing.
Currently allowed scopes:

It is imperative that scopes are specified correctly or else the whole CI
pipeline fails and the only remedy is rebasing and rewording commits, which is
both tiresome and error-prone.

- `@hertzg/binstruct`
- `@binstruct/cli`
- `@binstruct/ethernet`
- `@binstruct/png`
- `@binstruct/wav`
- `@hertzg/wg-keys`
- `@hertzg/wg-ini`
- `@hertzg/wg-conf`
- `@hertzg/mymagti-api`
- `@hertzg/bx`
- `@hertzg/ip`
- `@hertzg/crc`
- `@hertzg/routeros-api`
- `@hertzg/tplink-api`
- `@hertzg/xhb`

## Adding New Workspaces

When adding a new workspace to the monorepo, update these files:

1. **CLAUDE.md** (this file):
   - Add the workspace to the "Workspaces" list
   - Add the package name to the "Valid Commit Scopes" list

2. **README.md**:
   - Add the new package to the table with JSR badge

3. **Configuration files** (validated by `deno task lint`):
   - `.github/labeler.yml` - Add label with package name and glob pattern
   - `.github/workflows/title.yaml` - Add package name to scopes
   - `.github/release.yml` - Add package name to scopes
   - `import_map.json` - Add JSR import for the package

The lint tools `lint:labeler`, `lint:title`, `lint:import-map`, and `lint:deps`
will fail if these files are not updated correctly.

## Common Patterns

### Binary Data Operations

- Document buffer size requirements in JSDoc
- Show encoding and decoding in examples
- Verify round-trip data integrity
- Support both platform-default and explicit endianness

### Struct Composition

Complex binary formats are built by composing coders:

```typescript ignore
const header = struct({
  magic: string(4),
  version: u16le(),
  flags: u32be(),
});

const fileFormat = struct({
  header: header,
  data: bytes(ref(() => header.fields.size)),
});
```

### Reference Dependencies

Use `ref()` for field-to-field dependencies (e.g., length-prefixed data):

```typescript ignore
const lengthCoder = u32le();
const data = struct({
  length: lengthCoder,
  payload: bytes(ref(lengthCoder)), // payload size from length field
});
```

### Forward-Only References

Due to single-pass processing, fields can only reference earlier fields:

```typescript ignore
// ✅ Correct - length comes before data
const length = u32le();
const data = struct({
  length, // Decoded first
  payload: bytes(ref(length)), // Can reference earlier field
});

// ❌ Incorrect - cannot reference later fields
const length = u32le();
const invalid = struct({
  payload: bytes(ref(length)), // Error: length not in context yet
  length, // Decoded after payload
});

// ✅ Workaround - compute lengths during encode, structure fields in order
const dataLength = u32le();
const fileWithPadding = struct({
  dataLength, // Store computed length first
  data: bytes(ref(dataLength)), // Then the data
  padding: bytes(computedRef( // Then padding based on earlier fields
    [ref(dataLength)],
    (len) => (4 - (len % 4)) % 4, // Align to 4-byte boundary
  )),
});
```
