- Always run `gh` in the same shell as the user or it won't be authenticated.
- When committing, prefix the PR title with the package name, such as "@tus/server: foo bar". By default, commit message and description become the default PR title.
- Instead of running tests locally, push the changes to the branch and poll CI.
- Always poll the Devin Review GitHub Action, when it's done, read its PR comments.
