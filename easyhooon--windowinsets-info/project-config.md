# WindowInsets — Codex project guide

## Product goal

Clone https://safearea.info as faithfully as possible for Android. The reference is
the product specification, not visual inspiration: match its information hierarchy,
layout, typography, spacing, responsive transitions, diagram proportions, controls,
and direct-manipulation behavior before proposing independent improvements. Adapt
only the platform-specific substance—Android WindowInsets semantics, navigation
modes, fold states, and official Samsung device artwork. Keep reference-shaped UI
when an Android equivalent exists; document every intentional divergence in
`docs/REFERENCE_PARITY.md`. Improve the existing device set before collecting more
data or adding unrelated features.

Coverage decision (2026-09-22, updated 2026-09-24): all Samsung Galaxy models
with official skins are in scope when released in 2020 or later; Galaxy Fold
and Flip models with official skins are in scope at any release year. Discontinuation
and flagship status do not affect coverage. Follow
the priority order in README: current S/Fold/Flip quality → Tab → Note and A.
Keep other pre-2020 artwork archived but exclude it from public devices/routes. Check
new imports against `docs/DEVICE_COVERAGE.md`. TriFold supports official cover/inner
artwork and a two-hinge 3D animation (approved 2026-09-24). Artwork-only entries stay previews;
missing measurements must not be invented.

RTL collection policy: keep registered skins regardless of RTL availability,
but prioritize new measurements from RTL-offered models. User-supplied physical
devices (such as Fold2) can also contribute verified captures. Track RTL catalog status
separately from per-screen captures. Only a complete, dated reservation inventory
can establish that a model is not listed; 403 responses and featured-only lists
leave other models unverified. Preserve historical captures. See
`docs/RTL_COVERAGE.md` for evidence and comparison status.

## Start here

- `docs/REFERENCE_PARITY.md`: binding clone doctrine, observed reference behavior,
  intentional Android substitutions, implementation status and visual QA.
- `docs/MEASUREMENT_WORKFLOW.md`: capture process, known RTL issues, corrections.
- `docs/MEASUREMENT_WORKFLOW.md` "Device Status & Progress": the single
  remaining-measurement queue. Phones and foldables need natural, rotation 1
  and rotation 3 captures in both navigation modes; tablets also need reverse
  portrait, for all four distinct rotations per mode. Pick the next device
  from the queue and update it in the same commit as each device's captures.
- `docs/RTL_CREDITS.md`: published credit policy, live grant evidence and budget rules.
- React Router framework mode, React, TypeScript, three.js; pnpm; static prerender.
- `pnpm dev`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test:visual`,
  `node --test tests/rendering.test.mjs`.

## Non-negotiable data boundaries

- Raw files in `measurements/` are immutable evidence. Missing measurements stay
  null/pending. Skin pixel coordinates are artwork metadata, not measured insets.
- Fold8's legacy `main-*.json` captures are 1248×1972, matching the official COVER
  skin. The website classifies them as cover from this evidence; the original
  labels/files remain unchanged. The dated `recapture-2026-09-22/` set contains
  separate verified cover and 2448×1848 landscape inner captures. Never rotate or
  stretch the legacy cover values onto the inner display.
- Skin foregrounds depict physical cameras; DisplayCutout bounds describe an OS
  exclusion rectangle. Do not replace the artwork's camera with the bounds.
- Orientation never invents WindowInsets. Flat devices show a rotation's insets
  only from a capture of that rotation (`landscape-<rotation>-*` probe files); otherwise window
  size and corners follow the display geometry and insets read "not measured
  yet". 3D foldables follow the same rule: the model turns while its display
  shows the upright, re-laid-out screen.

## Rendering and assets

- `app/components/DeviceView.tsx` owns view state and controls.
- `DiagramViewport.tsx` owns fit, pan, pinch, keyboard zoom and view rotation.
- `InsetsDiagram.tsx` uses SVG for flat displays; `FoldRenderer3D.tsx` uses a
  textured display plus a lit, closed chassis. `foldGeometry.ts` owns hinge math.
- `app/data/skins.ts` contains official asset rectangles. `public/skins/` keeps
  original Samsung images and emulator layout files with provenance. Body clips
  are illustrative, display rectangles come directly from the layout.
- For rendering or control changes, check desktop and mobile, Fold/Flip/bar,
  dp/px, closed/partial/open, controls, and no-data screens. Do not rely on a
  successful TypeScript build as visual QA.
- For artwork-only skin registration (ZIP assets, generated skin data, and
  coverage docs without behavior changes), inspect the new layout and asset
  links plus the new desktop/mobile preview. Skip automated test suites,
  typecheck, and build for this case; run them when application or
  importer behavior changes or a concrete failure needs diagnosis.
- Keep motion reduced when requested by the OS; dispose GPU resources on unmount.
