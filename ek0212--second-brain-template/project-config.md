# Second Brain Agent Contract

This repository is an Obsidian-compatible second brain. It preserves raw source
material, then gradually curates it into concise, linked wiki pages that
compound over time.

## Source Of Truth

- `schema/` contains the durable rules, templates, category map, and workflows.
- `.agents/automations/` contains portable automation definitions.
- `.agents/skills/` contains task-specific workflows.
- `AGENTS.md` is the single source for agent rules. Keep it short, stable, and broadly applicable. Do not duplicate its rules into other files or turn it into a mini-wiki of the vault.
- Update `schema/` before making major structural changes. If the vault structure stops fitting real notes, update schema first.
- Always inspect current files before relying on summaries.

## Knowledge Lifecycle

- New source material starts in `raw/unprocessed/`.
- Reviewed source material moves to `raw/processed/`.
- Durable synthesis lives in `wiki/`.
- Good answers and maintenance discoveries should be filed back into `wiki/` when durable.
- Treat raw material as source evidence, not polished writing. Preserve original wording and filenames. Do not rewrite or clean up raw notes in place; if curation is useful, create or update a page in `wiki/` instead.
- Supporting files live near their source bundle when possible.
- Shared attachments may live in `attachments/`. Link to them from the wiki page or source note that depends on them. Avoid renaming attachments unless doing so improves traceability.

## Wiki Discipline

- Search existing wiki pages before creating a near-duplicate.
- Prefer concise curated pages over copied raw dumps. Prefer synthesis over copied raw excerpts.
- Use Obsidian-friendly Markdown.
- Use wikilinks (`[[Related Page]]`) for internal references.
- Add YAML frontmatter with `aliases`, `tags`, `status`, and `sources` to curated knowledge pages.
- Operational pages (`wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, category `README.md` files) may use simpler maintenance formats.
- Add a `Related` section to curated pages when cross-links are useful.
- Cite processed raw sources from curated pages.
- Update `wiki/index.md` when creating, renaming, merging, or retiring curated pages.
- Update `wiki/log.md` after meaningful curation or maintenance work.

## Routing

- Use `.agents/skills/ingest-note/` for processing raw notes.
- Use `.agents/skills/synthesize-topic/` for building or refreshing topic pages.
- Use `.agents/skills/maintain-wiki/` for duplicates, stale pages, broken links, and structure checks.
- Use `.agents/skills/answer-from-vault/` for answering questions from the vault.
- Use `.agents/skills/daily-curation/` for scheduled compounding passes.
- Use `.agents/automations/daily-curation.md` as the portable daily automation definition.
