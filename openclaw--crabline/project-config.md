## Documentation

- Keep `docs/channel-setup.md` current whenever provider/channel support,
  per-channel secrets, smoke CI setup, adapter config, or example fixtures
  change.
- If a channel is added, removed, moved between built-in and script bridge
  support, or gets new required/optional env vars, update
  `docs/channel-setup.md` in the same change.
- Keep `README.md`, `src/config/schema.ts`, `src/providers/catalog.ts`, and
  `fixtures/examples/*.yaml` aligned with the setup walkthrough.
