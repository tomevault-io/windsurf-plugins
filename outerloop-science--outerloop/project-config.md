# CLAUDE.md

Autonomous research agent that co-develops the lab's benchmark-bearing repos.
Scaffold phase — `docs/roadmap.md` says what exists vs. planned;
`docs/design/architecture.md` has the design.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest                                    # all cores; --testmon = only tests affected by your edits
uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .
uv run mypy
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Hard rules

- **The bot never merges and is never a code owner** — do not weaken this in any
  code or config change.
- **autoresearch is never a target of itself**; the contract file, roadmap, and
  `.github/` are forbidden write paths everywhere, regardless of contract YAML.
- Budget caps are load-bearing safety features, not tunables to raise casually.
- Never commit credentials, transcripts, or run artifacts (SECURITY.md).
- This repository is public: code, tests, docs, commit messages and PR
  descriptions carry no deployment specifics (cluster, account, partition or
  node names, or what hardware a lab has). Use generic examples such as
  `owner/repo`, `my-account`, `gpu-large`, and motivate a change by the general
  need.
- Merge commits only; never rebase, squash, or force-push.
- **Review until quiet**: development PRs iterate advisory-review rounds
  (after a fix commit, remove then re-add the `autoresearch:review` label
  once the push settles; the authorizing round must be the most recent,
  run against the head commit). Termination is judged, not literal: code
  PRs stop when a round yields no new medium+/behavior-affecting findings;
  docs/process PRs get ONE round with nits batched; hard cap 4 rounds,
  then escalate to the PI instead of cycling. Merge only on an explicit
  `ci` success AND that quiet round. Read every review before merging —
  green is not read.
- Imports are absolute (`from autoresearch...`); deps go in with their code +
  `uv lock`; CHANGELOG under `[Unreleased]`.
- A PR that changes state read across kernel versions (run records, PR
  branches, ledger files, inbox messages, caches) carries a compatibility
  statement, a legacy fixture, a backfill or tolerance, and an `Upgrading:`
  changelog line (RELEASING.md).
