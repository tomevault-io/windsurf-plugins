# Effect Best Practices

## Core Patterns

### Service Architecture
- Always use `Effect.Service` for defining and providing services
- Define interfaces with readonly methods and Effect return types
- Implement services as classes or factory functions using Effect.Service
- Keep services focused on single responsibility
```typescript
// Interface definition
export interface ILoggingService {
    readonly getLogger: (name?: string) => Effect.Effect<Logger>
}

// Service class definition (Effect.Service pattern)
export class LoggingService extends Effect.Service<ILoggingService>()("LoggingService", {
    effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
        // Implementation
    })
})
```

### Effect Generation & Composition
- Use `Effect.gen` for complex operations
- Chain operations using `pipe()`
- Use `yield*` for dependency access
- Compose effects using `flatMap` for sequential operations
```typescript
return Effect.gen(function* () {
    const service = yield* LoggingService
    const config = yield* service.getConfig()
    const result = yield* performOperation(config)
    return result
}).pipe(
    Effect.mapError(e => new DomainError("Operation failed", { cause: e }))
)
```

### Error Handling
- Define domain-specific error hierarchies
- Use `Effect.fail` instead of throwing errors
- Handle all error cases explicitly
- Preserve error context using cause

### Type Safety
- Define explicit Effect return types
- Use type parameters for generic operations
- Create union types for error cases
- Use branded types for type-safe identifiers

## Advanced Patterns

### Performance & Concurrency
- Use `Effect.forEach` with concurrency control
- Add timeouts to long-running operations
- Track operation timing with performance metrics

### Resource Management
- Use `Effect.acquireRelease` for cleanup
- Ensure proper resource scoping
- Handle cleanup in error cases

### Configuration & State
- Use Effect for configuration loading
- Validate configurations at load time
- Provide type-safe access to values

### Logging & Monitoring
- Use structured logging
- Add context annotations
- Track timing information

## Testing Patterns

### Test Structure
- Group tests by feature/method
- Use descriptive names
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert

### Mock Services
- Create interface-compliant mocks
- Use Effect.succeed/fail for paths
- Reset state between tests

### Testing Effects
- Test success and error paths
- Verify error types and messages
- Check state changes and interactions

## Best Practices
1. Always use `Effect.Service` for defining and providing services
2. Keep services focused and interfaces small
3. Use Effect for all async/fallible operations
4. Handle all error cases explicitly
5. Make error handling predictable and consistent
6. Use proper dependency injection via Effect.Service class
7. Keep effects pure and predictable
8. Add timeouts to external operations
9. Track performance metrics
10. Test both success and error paths
11. Document public interfaces and effects

## Anti-patterns to Avoid
1. **Do not use `Context.Tag` directly or via class-based pattern.**
   - Explicit Context.Tag usage is forbidden. Use the Effect.Service class pattern for all service definitions and dependency injection.
2. Don't mix Effect with Promise-based code
3. Don't throw errors in Effect chains
4. Don't use type assertions unnecessarily
5. Don't ignore error cases
6. Don't skip resource cleanup
7. Don't mix sync and async code without Effect
8. Don't bypass the Effect type system
9. Don't use global state
10. Don't test implementation details
11. Don't use real services in unit tests
