### Unit Testing Guidelines for Agents and Their Nodes

1. **Test Framework:**
   - **Vitest** is the required testing framework for all tests.

2. **Configuration Service:**
   - When testing an agent or its nodes, **use the real shared configuration service**.
   - **Do not mock** any configuration files, specifically:
     - **Shared Configuration Files:**  
       - `models.json`  
       - `providers.json`  
       These files are common to all agents and are located in the `agents/config` folder.
     - **Agent-Specific Configuration Files:**  
       - `prompts.json`  
       - `tasks.json`  
       Each agent has its own versions, located in the `agents/{agent-name}/config` directory.

3. **Mocking Practices:**
   - When mocking is necessary for functions or methods, **prefer using Vitest's `spyOn` function** rather than creating full mocks.
   - This practice ensures that the tests remain focused on agent behavior and use real configuration data where applicable.
