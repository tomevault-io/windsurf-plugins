description: Prefer reusing existing ZAP code over writing new redundant helpers

# Prefer reuse; minimize new code

Before adding new functions, SQL, helpers, or modules:

1. Search the repo for an existing API that already does (or nearly does) the job.
2. Prefer calling or lightly extending that API over copying logic or inventing a parallel path.
3. Add new code only when no suitable existing path exists—and keep the addition as small as possible.

## Checklist

- DB access: look in `src-electron/db/query-*.js` first; do not embed raw SQL in `ide-integration/`, `rest/`, or UI layers when a query helper already exists.
- Shared utilities: check `src-electron/util/`, `src/util/`, and nearby modules in the same feature area.
- Match call patterns already used by similar features (grep for callers of the helper you found).

```javascript
// ❌ BAD — new SQL in ide-integration when query-endpoint already covers it
dbApi.dbAll(db, `SELECT ... FROM ENDPOINT ... ENDPOINT_TYPE_CLUSTER ...`)

// ✅ GOOD — reuse existing query helpers
const endpoints = await queryEndpoint.selectAllEndpoints(db, sessionId)
const clusters = await queryEndpoint.selectEndpointClusters(
  db,
  endpoint.endpointTypeRef
)
```

If you almost-duplicate existing code, stop and reuse or extract once into the proper layer instead.
