# Copilot Instructions

This file is intentionally concise to reduce token overhead.

## Canonical policy source

- The canonical, comprehensive agent policy for this repository is `AGENTS.md` at the repository root.
- Apply `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth for architecture boundaries, style, testing, migration rules, and done criteria.

## Always-enforced highlights

- Keep all application LLM instructions separated from code and stored in `resources/config/instructions.json`.
- Project/story file format changes must be backward compatible or include explicit schema/version bumps with automatic chainable migrations.
- Prioritize maintainable, compact code with strict separation of concerns and minimal duplication.
- Code must be professional and production-quality; avoid shortcuts and temporary hacks.

## Type discipline (Python + TypeScript)

- All new/modified Python and TypeScript code must be typed.
- Shared/library helpers should use reasonably wide reusable types where safety is preserved.
- Application/domain functions should use the strictest minimal types possible to encode invariants.
- Convert from wider boundary types to stricter internal types at module boundaries.
