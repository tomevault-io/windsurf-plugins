# AGENTS.md

gbs-anywhere stands in for the espresso machine a Mahlkönig E64 WS grinder
syncs with (Grind-by-Sync). The grinder polls it over HTTP on port 80; a
person on their phone, or an optional integration, reports each shot's time
and weight; the grinder then adjusts its grind setting. One Rust crate, one
HTML page, one Docker image. README.md is for users; this file is for agents
changing the code.

## Layout

- `src/protocol/`: the grinder link as plain types, no I/O. `machine.rs` holds
  the state machine and shot rules, `wire.rs` the JSON field names.
- `src/server/`: axum. `grinder_api.rs` is what the grinder calls
  (`/api/v2/*`); `control_api.rs` is the JSON API and page for people.
- `src/integration/`: optional integrations that report shots by themselves,
  one folder each (see [Integrations](#integrations)).
- `web/index.html`: the whole phone app (HTML, CSS, JS), no build step.
- `src/main.rs`: flags and startup only.

## Commands

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo fmt
# Local run, then open http://localhost:8089/
cargo run -- -p 8089 --control off --no-stdin --config target/dev.json
```

- `web/index.html` is compiled into the binary (`include_str!`). After
  editing it, rebuild and restart the server; refreshing the browser alone
  shows the old page.
- Port 80, the default, is what a real grinder uses. Use another port when 80
  is taken. Keep local settings files under `target/` (git-ignored), because
  they hold passwords.
- Docker is not needed for development; CI builds the image.

## Done means

- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` (no warnings) and
  `cargo test` pass. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same checks on
  every push and pull request.
- For page changes, open the page at phone width (about 390 px) in light and
  dark mode and look at the result. There is no JavaScript test suite.
- README.md (and an integration's own README) matches any change to
  user-visible behaviour, flags or the API.

## Code conventions

- Rust 2024; the minimum Rust version is `rust-version` in Cargo.toml.
  `unsafe` is forbidden by a lint.
- Match the surrounding code: short doc comments saying what and why,
  `anyhow` with `.context(...)` for errors people will read, and messages in
  plain sentences.
- Keep `src/protocol/` free of I/O and clocks (callers pass `Instant`s), so
  the grinder's behaviour stays testable without a grinder.
- The grinder-facing API (`/api/v2/*`, names in `wire.rs`) is exactly what
  the grinder expects. Don't rename, drop or retype fields there.
- Few dependencies, all pure Rust. TLS is rustls with the `ring` provider (no
  OpenSSL, no cmake), which keeps the distroless image working. Give the
  reason when adding a dependency.
- Tests sit next to the code in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` and go through real
  functions rather than mocks. Temporary files go under
  `std::env::temp_dir()`. `src/server/tests.rs` runs the real routers over
  HTTP with `GrinderModel` playing the grinder; extend it when what the
  grinder sees changes.

## Integrations

Each integration is a folder `src/integration/<id>/` with `mod.rs`
(`pub static KIND: Kind`), `config.rs` (the form's `FIELDS`, a typed config,
and a clap `Args` with `#[group(id = "<id>")]`), `run.rs` (implements
`Integration`), `icon.svg` and `README.md`. Register it in
`src/integration/mod.rs` in four places: `pub mod`, `KINDS`, a `CliArgs`
field and its line in `CliArgs::configured`.
The module docs there are the full spec; `la_marzocco/` is the worked example.

- Report shots only through `Link::report`. It holds the rules every
  integration shares: a shot counts only while the grinder waits after a knob
  press, and a missing weight falls back to the recipe weight.
- Secrets are `Input::Password` fields. Settings never go back out through
  the API or into logs. Keys that are not on the form, such as a test base
  URL, stay command-line only.
- Vendor logos are trademarks: draw a generic glyph for `icon.svg`. People
  can supply their own icons with `--icons`.
- Test against a local fake of the vendor's service. Don't send test traffic
  or made-up credentials to a vendor's real service.

## Web app

- One file, no framework, no requests to other hosts: it is served on a home
  network that may have no internet access.
- Colours are CSS variables on `:root`, redefined for dark mode. Use them
  instead of literal colours.
- Phone first: content at most 480 px wide, 16 px side padding, no
  horizontal scrolling.
- Typing the time and weight by hand is the default flow and must work with no
  integration set up. Integrations are optional, behind the green + in the
  header.

## Public repository wording

The repository and its history are public. In code, comments, docs, commit
messages and pull requests:

- Write in English.
- Describe what the app does for the person using it. Don't write about how
  the grinder's protocol was worked out, and don't refer to vendor software
  internals or vendor-internal tools.
- Leave out anyone's local setup: IP addresses (except documentation
  examples such as `192.168.1.20`), hostnames, serial numbers, account names,
  photos, and logs or transcripts from real devices.
