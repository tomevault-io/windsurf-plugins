# Video Clip Extractor

## Build & Run

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/video-clip-extractor.exe <directory>  # Windows
./target/release/video-clip-extractor <directory>       # Unix
```

## Commands

```bash
cargo test                    # Run all tests
cargo test -- --nocapture     # Run tests with print output
cargo test -- --ignored       # Run property-based tests (proptest)
cargo clippy                  # Lint
cargo fmt                     # Format code
cargo check                   # Type check without building
```

## Requirements

- **Rust** (Edition 2024 - requires nightly or recent stable)
- **FFmpeg** (must be in PATH): `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` commands

## Architecture

```
src/
├── main.rs       # CLI entry point, orchestrates components
├── cli.rs        # Argument parsing (clap derive)
├── processor.rs  # Video processing orchestration
├── scanner.rs    # Recursive directory scanning
├── selector.rs   # Clip selection strategies (random, intense-audio, action)
├── ffmpeg/       # FFmpeg wrapper (executor, command_builder, analysis, metadata)
├── progress.rs  # Progress reporting
└── logger.rs    # Failure logging
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Movie folder format only**: Scans for directories matching `"Movie Name (Year)"` pattern (e.g., "The Matrix (1999)")
- Only processes videos inside movie folders, skips non-movie subdirectories
- Skips directories with `backdrops/done.ext` marker (unless `--force` is used)
- Creates `backdrops/backdrop1.mp4`, `backdrop2.mp4`, etc. (configurable via `-c` flag)
- Processes videos **sequentially** (FFmpeg itself is multi-threaded)
- Integration tests create temp videos via FFmpeg; skip if FFmpeg unavailable

## Testing

Integration tests are in `tests/` and use `tests/common/mod.rs` helpers:

- `create_test_video()` - creates test videos with FFmpeg
- `build_binary()` - compiles release binary
- `get_binary_path()` - returns platform-specific binary path

Tests that require FFmpeg: run with `cargo test` (they skip gracefully if FFmpeg is absent).

## Binary Name

- Windows: `video-clip-extractor.exe`
- Unix: `video-clip-extractor`
