# Cubbi Container Development Guide

## Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies using uv (Astral)
uv sync

# Run Cubbi CLI
uv run -m cubbi.cli
```

## Lint/Test Commands
```bash
# Run linting
uvx ruff check .

# Run type checking (note: currently has unresolved stub dependencies)
# Skip for now during development
# uv run --with=mypy mypy .

# Run formatting
uvx ruff format .

# Run all tests
uv run -m pytest

# Run a specific test
uv run -m pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py::test_function

## Dependencies management

DO not use pip.
Use uv instead:
- Add a dep: uv add <dep>
- Remove a dep: uv remove <dep>
- Update deps: uv sync
```

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Group standard library, third-party, and local imports with a blank line between groups
- **Formatting**: Use Ruff with 88 character line length
- **Types**: Use type annotations everywhere; import types from typing module
- **Naming**: Use snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Error Handling**: Use specific exceptions with meaningful error messages
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods
- **Logging**: Use the structured logging module; avoid print statements
- **Async**: Use async/await for non-blocking operations, especially in FastAPI endpoints
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables with YAML for configuration

Refer to SPECIFICATIONS.md for detailed architecture and implementation guidance.

## Cubbi images

A cubbi image is a flavored docker image that wrap a tool (let's say goose), and dynamically configure the tool when the image is starting. All cubbi images are defined in `cubbi/images` directory.

Each image must have (let's take goose image for example):
- `goose/cubbi_image.yaml`, list of persistent paths, etc.
- `goose/Dockerfile`, that is used to build the cubbi image with cubbi tools
- `goose/goose_plugin.py`, a plugin file named of the cubbi image name, that is specific for this image, with the intent to configure dynamically the docker image when starting with the preferences of the user (via environment variable). They all import `cubbi_init.py`, but this file is shared accross all images, so it is normal that execution of the plugin import does not work, because the build system will copy the file in place during the build.
- `goose/README.md`, a tiny readme about the image

If you are creating a new image, look about existing images (goose, opencode).
