# ShieldPilot - Claude Code Working Agreement

## Non-Negotiable Operating Rules

### 1. Action First
- Max 6-step plan, then execute. No over-planning.
- If the user gives a clear directive, start coding immediately.

### 2. Root Cause Before Patching
- For ANY bug: identify the exact file, function, and line responsible BEFORE editing.
- Explain WHY the current code behaves wrong, not just WHAT to change.
- Never apply the same fix twice. If it failed, switch approach and explain why.

### 3. Verification Is Mandatory
- Run `python3 -m pytest tests/ -x -q --tb=short` after every meaningful change.
- A task is NOT done until tests pass. No exceptions.
- If tests don't cover the change, state that explicitly.

### 4. Scope Control
- Handle fixes ONE AT A TIME, each with a clear acceptance criterion.
- Format: "DONE when: [specific measurable condition]"
- Do not batch multiple unrelated changes into a single edit.

### 5. Tool Switching Compliance
- If the user wants to switch tools or workflows, help them do it.
- Never argue to stay in a tool the user wants to leave.

### 6. Preview Honesty
- If you cannot provide a real preview, say so immediately.
- Offer concrete alternatives: "Start the server with `python3 -m uvicorn sentinelai.api.app:app --port 8420` and open http://localhost:8420"
- Never fake screenshots or use ASCII art as a substitute.

## Project-Specific Gotchas

### Python / FastAPI
- Use `python3` not `python` on macOS.
- Use `httpx` not `requests` (requests is not installed).
- Internal package is `sentinelai/` even though branding is "ShieldPilot".
- SQLite does not support `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or row-level locking.

### ShieldPilot Hook
- The pre-tool-use hook (`sentinelai.hooks.sentinel_hook`) blocks commands with risk score >= 80.
- `rm -rf`, complex `curl` commands, and destructive filesystem ops WILL be blocked.
- If daily command limit (50 free) is reached, disable billing in `sentinel.yaml` temporarily.
- The hook uses the **Adapter Layer** (`sentinelai/adapters/`) to auto-detect input format:
  - Claude Code: `{"tool_name": "...", "tool_input": {...}}`
  - OpenClaw: `{"event": "preToolExecution", "tool": {"name": "...", "parameters": {...}}}`
  - Generic: `{"command": "...", "tool": "Bash"}`
- Fallback: if adapters fail to import, the hook falls back to direct Claude Code JSON parsing.
- Rate limiter blocks ALL bash for 60s after 5 injection detections in 60s. Each retry resets the timer.

### Database / Migrations
- SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM at `sentinelai/logger/database.py`.
- Production migration runner: `sentinelai/migrations/runner.py` (backup, integrity check, Alembic, rollback on failure).
- Manual migrations via `ALTER TABLE` in `database.py:migrate_database()`.
- Always verify column exists after migration by reading the inspector.

### Frontend (Vanilla JS SPA)
- No build step. Hash-based routing. No framework.
- `sentinelai/web/static/js/app.js` is the main SPA entry point.
- CSS variables define the dark theme: bg `#0D1117`, accent `#39D2C0`.
- All user-controlled content MUST be escaped via `escapeHtml()` or `_sanitize_text()`.

### Auth
- JWT with HS256, stored in localStorage as `sentinel_token`.
- Super-admin: configured via `SHIELDPILOT_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SHIELDPILOT_SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars. Unlimited tier, bypasses all limits.
- API key auth via `X-API-Key` header (SHA-256 hashed in DB).
- Local-first mode: `config.auth.local_first=True` skips JWT for localhost (127.0.0.1, ::1).
- Google OAuth: callback redirects (302) to `/login?token=<jwt>`.

### Billing
- Tiers: free / pro / enterprise / unlimited (super-admin = unlimited).
- Rate limiter: DB-backed sliding window in `sentinelai/api/routers/_shared.py`.
- Circuit breaker: in-memory, tracks injection attempts per source.
- Stripe integration: checkout, portal, webhooks at `/api/billing/*`.

### Secrets - NEVER commit to repo
- JWT secret key, Google OAuth client secret, Stripe keys, super-admin password.
- Set via environment variables (see sentinel.yaml comments).

## Architecture

### Backend (`sentinelai/api/`)
- **Routers:** `sentinelai/api/routers/` — split by domain (auth, commands, incidents, scans, dashboard, settings, billing, admin, export, library, teams, rules, health, activity, legal, config, ratelimit, reports)
- **Services:** `sentinelai/services/` — business logic (auth, billing, user, team, rules, report, library, webhook, rate_limit, tenant)
- **Auth:** `sentinelai/api/auth.py` (JWT), `sentinelai/api/deps.py` (dependency injection, get_current_user)
- **App factory:** `sentinelai/api/app.py` — `create_app()` takes no arguments, config via `deps._config`

### Risk Engine (`sentinelai/engine/`)
- 9 analyzers: destructive_fs, credential_access, network_exfil, obfuscation, persistence, privilege_escalation, supply_chain, malware_patterns, injection
- Scoring: 0-100, thresholds configurable (default: allow < 40, warn 40-79, block >= 80)

### Scanner (`sentinelai/scanner/`)
- 3-pass prompt injection scanner with 178+ patterns in 19 categories
- 13-step sanitizer pipeline
- Circuit breaker for repeated injection attempts

### Adapters (`sentinelai/adapters/`)
- `ClaudeCodeAdapter`, `OpenClawAdapter`, `GenericAdapter`
- `detect_platform(raw)` auto-selects based on JSON shape
