# Notes for agents working in this repository

This project is a revival of a 2011–2012 hyperbolic-plane map viewer. Most of the hard-won knowledge
is **not** obvious from the code, so it lives in [`notes/`](notes/). Read the notes before changing
anything mathematical.

## Start here

1. **[`notes/log.md`](notes/log.md)** — append-only chronological record of what was implemented and
   *why*. Read the last few entries to see where work stopped.
2. **[`notes/math-audit.md`](notes/math-audit.md)** — the single most important file. Every formula in
   the original code and every formula in this library, with its verification status. **It records
   what was verified *correct* as well as what was broken**, specifically so that working code does
   not get "fixed" by a later pass.
3. **[`notes/open-questions.md`](notes/open-questions.md)** — what is unresolved or unproven.

## House rules

- **Append to `notes/log.md` on every substantive change.** One entry per change: what, why,
  what was rejected and why, what was measured, what is left. Never rewrite or reorder past entries.
- **Keep the topic notes current** when you change the thing they describe. A stale note is worse
  than no note.
- **Do not "correct" anything marked verified-correct in `notes/math-audit.md`** without first
  reproducing the verification and recording the new result there. Several parts of the original code
  look wrong and are not.
- **Never commit `OLD/`.** It held two archived disk images and the original 2011-2012 repo, and it
  is not redistributable. It has been deleted from the working tree. Note there is **no `.gitignore`
  rule** stopping it coming back -- if you ever restore it locally, check `git status` before staging.
  Nothing in this repository depends on it: the last code that did was removed in the PR #2 cleanup.
- **The demos are not regenerated from sources.** The scripts that built `docs/*.json` from the 2011
  databases and from the Escher raster were removed in the PR #2 cleanup; the committed JSON under
  `docs/` is the artifact. Do not try to rebuild it -- edit it, or write a new generator.
- **Before quoting any performance number, check CPU and GPU load** immediately before and after the
  measurement, and record both alongside the result. This machine is often busy with unrelated work.
  If it is busy, say so and defer the measurement rather than reporting a misleading figure.
- **No global software installs.** Temporary or local installs only. `node`, `npm` and `python3` are
  already available.
- The library has **zero runtime dependencies** and must stay that way. `dev/check-bundle.mjs`
  enforces the source constraints that let `dev/build.mjs` work without a bundler — run
  `npm run check` after touching module structure.
- **`dev/` is maintenance scripting, not shipped code**: the bundler and its style checker, the two
  mathematical audits (`audit_atlas_math.py` needs `sympy`; `audit_atlas_numeric.py` needs `mpmath`
  and is fed by `node dev/emit_atlas_samples.mjs > build/atlas-samples.json`), `capture_server.py`
  for exact canvas-pixel diffs, and `md_to_html.py` (needs `mistune`), which made `docs/index.html`
  out of the README once and is **not** part of any build — that HTML is the main copy now. Re-run
  both audits after changing anything in `src/core/` or `src/data/atlas/`. [`tools/`](tools/) is the
  separate, USER-facing directory: the SVG conversion pair, which has no dependencies at all.
- **`docs/index.html` is the documentation**, hand-edited HTML rather than generated from anything.
  `README.md` is the landing page and links to it. Do not move reference material back into the
  README: there is one copy of each fact, deliberately.
- **`src/index.d.ts` is hand-written and must track the barrel.** There is no JSDoc in `src/`, so
  generating it produces `any` everywhere and infers the *defaults* as the types — do not try. Add
  an export to `src/index.js` and you must declare it there too; `test/types.test.mjs` fails by name
  if you do not, and `npm run typecheck` (`dev/typecheck/`, needs the network because it fetches
  `tsc` with `npx -y`) checks that the declarations still reject what they should. It is
  deliberately not part of `npm test`, which must keep working offline.
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml` cannot be renamed.** npm's trusted-publisher configuration
  stores the workflow *filename*, case-sensitively, and matches on it; renaming the file breaks
  publishing until it is re-registered on npmjs.com. `ci.yml` beside it runs the checks on every
  push, including that the committed `dist/` matches a fresh build.
