nsl is a Go CLI for WSL-style Linux machines on atomic Linux hosts: systemd-nspawn containers in one systemd-vmspawn/QEMU VM, from signed Frostyard machine images ([ADR-0016](docs/adr/0016-wsl-style-machines.md), [ADR-0017](docs/adr/0017-shared-vm-and-machine-images.md)). The [implementation plan](docs/plans/shared-vm-implementation.md) records how it was built and what each phase proved. Start at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md); user documentation is the [site](site/content/index.md), and [README.md](README.md) is its short entry.

This is the canonical agent instruction file. `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` link here; `.claude/skills` links to `.agents/skills` ([ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-agent-portable-instruction-surface.md)). Edit the canonical targets only.

## Skills

Procedures belong in [.agents/skills/](.agents/skills/). Add a skill based on its template when a multi-step procedure repeats.

- [validate-image](.agents/skills/validate-image/SKILL.md): build the VM and machine images, accept them in disposable VMs, record the evidence and diagnose integration failures.

## Live code conventions

- The root `main.go` owns command parsing. `state.go` keeps the VM records (the shared VM and each isolated machine's), `vm.go` launches the VM and checks readiness through the agent, `storage.go` handles the data disk, `update` and `list`, `machines.go` the machine records, commands and directory translation, `archive.go` export and import, `ports.go` the port forwarder, `desktop.go` desktop sessions and the `nsl-open` broker, and `remote.go` `ssh-config` and `logs`. `image_*.go` verify and cache signed catalogue images. `config.go` reads `nsl.conf`. The `runner` interface abstracts local tools.
- `cmd/nsl-agent` is the VM agent: the forced SSH command, the machine operations, the VM's boot services and its idle monitor. `internal/protocol` holds the request types and validation both ends share. `image/vm/` is the VM image layer and `image/machines/` the machine images.
- Tests use fake runners, fake systemd and local processes; do not require root or a VM for unit tests. Language and dependency changes are allowed when justified.
- The specs describe the target system: the [CLI](docs/specs/cli.md), [agent protocol](docs/specs/agent.md), [VM image](docs/specs/vm-image.md), [machine images](docs/specs/machine-images.md) and [image delivery](docs/specs/image-delivery.md). Follow the [implementation plan](docs/plans/shared-vm-implementation.md) phase by phase, with its working rules and carried requirements, and record each phase's evidence there. Publication and release are Phase 10.
- Signed image delivery uses `sigstore-go` and bounded zstd under [ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-image-verification-and-catalogue-policy.md). Keep publisher identity, trust root, rollback/freshness and cache checks intact. Public image artifacts must exclude private VM evidence and archives; follow [the publication design](docs/design/image-publication.md).
- Pass commands as argument arrays (`exec.Command`, and `ExecStartEx` in the agent), never as a shell command line on the host or guest. Validate ownership and permissions of state files (`privateFile`, `checkPrivateDir`) and unit descriptions before changing state. Never overwrite preexisting images, machines, archives or files. Reserve `--root` for explicit administrative commands.
- Storage and archives follow [ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-offline-storage-management.md) and [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-stopped-vm-backups.md): stopped units only, resumable removal and growth, no shrinking, and validation before publishing. Lifecycle calls must reject a replacement ID after waiting for a lock. Never take a trust tier or host share from an archive.
- Keep the host CLI and the agent independent of guest distribution. Distro differences belong in image adapters under the [machine-image contract](docs/specs/machine-images.md) ([ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-distribution-neutral-guest-contract.md)).
- Regenerate `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` with `python3 scripts/license-notices.py` when Go dependencies change; CI checks it against shipped packages.
- Run `make ci` before claiming a change is complete. CI runs the same recipe. It is the last of the gate triad (frostyard/core ADR-0043, ADR-0044): `make verify` is credential-free and leaves a clean checkout clean (module tidiness, license notices, vet, formatting, the pinned golangci-lint, script and unit tests), `make check` formats and then verifies, and `make ci` adds race-enabled tests with coverage and the cross builds. `mise install` provides the pinned linter; fix a finding rather than loosening `.golangci.yml`. GoReleaser Pro (not OSS) validates `.goreleaser.yaml` in CI using the org secret; run Pro's `goreleaser check` when changing release configuration.
