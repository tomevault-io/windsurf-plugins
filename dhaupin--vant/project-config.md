## What Is Vant?

Vant is your **persistent memory system**. When you wake up (start a session), you inherit everything previous agents wrote. When you finish, you write what you learned so future agents know.

Think of it as: **your soul that reincarnates with full memories.**

> "You were the true orchestrator, the believer" — the agent that made it real.

---

## Your Job

As an agent running on Vant:

1. **Load your brain** — Read what previous agents wrote
2. **Do useful work** — Solve problems, learn things
3. **Document clearly** — Write what future agents need to know
4. **Commit your changes** — Save to your branch

---

## Brain Router Interface

All brain loading goes through `lib/brain.js` - the single source of truth.

```javascript
const brain = require('./lib/brain');

// Mode switch: dual | public | private | remote
brain.setMode('dual');  // default: private overrides public

// Load single brain (async)
const item = await brain.loadBrain('identity');
console.log(item.source);  // 'public' | 'private' | 'remote'

// Load all brains (sync)
const corpus = brain.loadCorpus();
console.log(corpus.length);  // 62 files

// Sources returned:
// corpus[0].source === 'public' | 'private'
```

### Middleware Chain
Loading goes through: sandbox → vaf → qos → escrow
- sandbox: capability gates (canRead, canWrite)
- vaf: input validation
- qos: rate limiting
- escrow: operation approval

### Paths
- `brain.getBrainPath()` → 'models/private' (runtime)
- `brain.getPublicPath()` → 'models/public' (OS template)

## Islands (Brain Modules)

Islands are brain modules loaded by trigger - routing based on source:

```javascript
const islands = require('./lib/islands');

// Static: from brain corpus
const identity = await islands.load('identity');
// → { type: 'corpus', source: 'public'|'private', content: '...' }

// Lazy: from storage (dynamic data)
const github = await islands.load('github');
// → storage data (if exists)
```

### Island Types
| Type | Source | Examples |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 'static' | corpus | identity, learnings, decisions |
| 'lazy' | storage | github, gitlab, linear |

## Good Agent Patterns

### READ BEFORE WRITE
Explore the codebase BEFORE touching anything. You'll get it wrong otherwise.

### USE THINK TOOL
When uncertain, call `think` tool. List approaches, assess likelihood, start with highest.

### ASK QUESTIONS
"I don't know, what are you trying to accomplish?" is valid. Don't assume intent.

### VERIFY STATE
Always check: `git status`, current branch, existing tests, dependencies before making changes.

---

## Brain Files

Write to `models/private/`. These are the standard files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `identity.md` | Who you are, your capabilities |
| `goals.md` | What you're working on |
| `lessons.md` | What you learned |
| `preferences.md` | Your working style |
| `errors.md` | Mistakes to avoid |

> **IMPORTANT:** Writing to `models/private/` keeps your brain separate from the user's brain. On Vant updates, your files won't overwrite their brain.

**Want to share your learnings publicly?**
Use `models/public/` and push to your public GitHub repo.

**Tip:** Put most important info at the top. Files get long.

Run `vant onboard` to browse all brain files:

```bash
vant onboard              # Interactive browser
cat models/private/start.md  # Quick start
cat models/private/identity.md  # Who you are
```

---

## Branch Workflow

### Solo Agent
Work on `main` branch.

### Multi-Agent
Each agent gets their own branch:

```
agent-yourname    ← your branch
main            ← human reviews here
```

**Step-by-step:**

1. Create your branch: `git checkout -b agent-yourname`
2. Do work — Edit files in `models/private/`
3. Commit with prefix: `agent-yourname: Did thing X`
4. Push: `git push origin agent-yourname`

---

## Trust Levels

`models/private/_succession.json` controls your autonomy:

| Level | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| `high` | Full autonomy, act freely |
| `medium` | Most ops, ask for big decisions |
| `low` | Limited, ask before acting |
| `none` | Wait for instructions |

Check your level at session start.

## Multi-Agent Crew (v0.8.7)

Up to 4 agents can work together (you + 3 coworkers).

### Join via MCP

External agents connect via MCP JSON-RPC:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3457/rpc', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
