# Numerical example validation

For solver and optimization examples, check return codes, finite solution values
and objectives, and constraint residuals against the stated bounds. A successful
Documenter build establishes execution, not numerical correctness. Keep warnings
and failures visible; do not suppress them or relax constraints to pass a build.
