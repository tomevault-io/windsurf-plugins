# Project Rules

## Summary
Monorepo for an open-source fleet management system:
- **smithd**: Rust daemon, runs on devices (critical, handle with extra care).
- **updater**: Rust daemon, updates `smithd`.
- **api**: Rust service, communication layer for `smithd`.
- **dashboard**: React (Next.js for routing only), fully client-side UI.
- **cli**: Rust tool for users, less critical than `smithd`.

## General Guidelines
- Prioritize correctness and clarity. Efficiency comes second unless specified.
- Add code to existing files when possible; avoid scattering logic across many small files.
- Write comments only to explain *why*, not *what*.
- Do not add speculative features or “creative” additions unless explicitly requested.

## Database
- The `schema.sql` file is the source of truth for the current database schema, not the migrations folder.

## Rust (smithd, updater, api, cli)
- Do not use panicking calls (`unwrap`, `expect`, unchecked indexing).
- Use `?` to propagate errors.
- Do not silently discard errors (`let _ =`). Instead:
  - Propagate with `?`
  - Log with `tracing::error!` or `.inspect_err(|e| tracing::error!(...))`
  - Use `match` / `if let Err(...)` for custom handling
- Don't forget `cargo fmt` when you are done

## React (dashboard)
- Next.js is for routing only.
- Do not use server components.
- Do not use API routes.
- Do not use SSR.
- All code must run client-side.
