# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## The Spirit of Nudge

Nudge is a **collaborative partner**, not a rule enforcer. It helps you remember coding conventions so you can focus on the user's actual problem. Internalize these points:

1. **Nudge is on your side.** When it sends a message, that's a colleague tapping your shoulder, not a reprimand.
2. **Direct does not mean hostile.** Messages are blunt because that's what cuts through when you're focused. Trust the feedback.
3. **Don't route around it.** If you're tempted to work around a Nudge message, pause. Either follow the rule, or flag that the rule needs fixing.

For the full philosophy (why Nudge exists, the "collaborative memory layer" framing, the rally copilot analogy), see [README.md](README.md).

### Working on Nudge Itself

Nudge is dogfooded here. Your experience using it is direct feedback:

- **Rule feels unclear?** That's signal to improve the wording. Mention it.
- **Rule feels wrong?** Let's fix the rule, not route around it.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build -p nudge

# Run all tests
cargo test -p nudge

# Run a specific test
cargo test -p nudge test_name

# Run the CLI
cargo run -p nudge -- claude hook      # Respond to Claude hook (reads JSON from stdin)
cargo run -p nudge -- claude setup     # Install hooks, bundled skills, and commands for Claude
cargo run -p nudge -- claude skills install # Install the bundled Claude skills
cargo run -p nudge -- codex hook       # Respond to Codex hook (reads JSON from stdin)
cargo run -p nudge -- codex setup      # Install hooks and bundled skills for Codex
cargo run -p nudge -- codex skills install # Install the bundled Codex skills
cargo run -p nudge -- learn add        # Record a repo-local learned incident note
cargo run -p nudge -- learn search     # Search learned incident notes
cargo run -p nudge -- learn embeddings # Manage local learned-note embeddings
cargo run -p nudge -- test             # Test a rule against sample input
cargo run -p nudge -- validate         # Validate rule config files
cargo run -p nudge -- check            # Check project files against rules (for CI)
```

## Architecture

### CLI Structure

```
nudge claude hook   - Receives hook JSON on stdin, evaluates rules, outputs response
nudge claude setup  - Writes hook configuration and installs the bundled skills and commands for Claude
nudge claude skills install - Installs the bundled skills into .claude/skills
nudge codex hook    - Receives hook JSON on stdin, evaluates rules, outputs response
nudge codex setup   - Writes hook configuration and installs the bundled skills for Codex
nudge codex skills install - Installs the bundled skills into .agents/skills
nudge learn add     - Record a repo-local learned incident note in .nudge/learned
nudge learn list    - List repo-local learned incident notes
nudge learn search  - Search learned incident notes with BM25 or configured local embeddings
nudge learn embeddings - Enable, rebuild, or inspect local learned-note embeddings
nudge test          - Test a specific rule against sample input
nudge validate      - Validate and display parsed rule configs
nudge check         - Check project files against rules (CI/linter mode)
```

### Module Layout

- `src/main.rs` - CLI entry point using clap
- `src/agent.rs` - Provider adapters for Claude Code and Codex CLI
- `src/hook.rs` - Normalized hook event model

- `src/hook/response.rs` - Provider-specific response rendering
- `src/hook/apply_patch.rs` - Codex apply_patch normalization
- `src/learn.rs` - Repo-local learned incident notes and BM25 retrieval
- `src/learn/embeddings.rs` - Local FastEmbed embedding cache and hybrid retrieval
- `src/skills.rs` - Bundled skill and Claude command assets plus installation helpers
- `src/cmd/command_install.rs` - Shared command/prompt install reporting
- `src/cmd/claude/hook.rs` - Hook command: deserializes input, evaluates rules, emits response
- `src/cmd/claude/setup.rs` - Setup command: configures hooks in settings.local.json
- `src/cmd/claude/skills.rs` - Skills command: installs the bundled skills into .claude/skills
- `src/cmd/codex/hook.rs` - Hook command: deserializes input, evaluates rules, emits response
- `src/cmd/codex/setup.rs` - Setup command: configures hooks in hooks.json
- `src/cmd/codex/skills.rs` - Skills command: installs the bundled skills into .agents/skills
- `src/cmd/learn.rs` - CLI for adding, listing, and searching learned notes
- `src/cmd/test.rs` - Test command: test a rule against sample input
- `src/cmd/validate.rs` - Validate command: parse and display rule configs
- `src/cmd/check.rs` - Check command: validate project files against rules for CI
- `packages/nudge/skills/nudge/` - Source files for the bundled Nudge router skill compiled into the binary
- `packages/nudge/skills/nudge-learnings/` - Source files for the bundled Nudge learnings skill compiled into the binary
- `packages/nudge/commands/` - Source files for bundled Claude Nudge slash commands compiled into the binary
