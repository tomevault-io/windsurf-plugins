# HyperFrames Video Pipeline: workspace guide

Turn a talking-head recording into an intentional edit using local HyperFrames
rendering, transcript-driven cuts, and reusable motion graphics.

## Runtime routing

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` contain the same standing guide. Keep them synchronized.
Claude Code uses `.claude/skills/`. Codex uses the generated `.agents/skills/`.
Edit canonical skills in `.claude/skills/`, then run `npm run sync:skills`.
Use `$edit-video` in Codex, `/edit-video` in Claude Code, or natural language.
Model and permission choices belong to the user; `.codex/config.toml` only adds
document loading defaults. Work locally unless the user requests subagents.

## Start and route

Read `README.md` for installation and `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for a complete edit.
Use `edit-video` to coordinate transcription, cuts, design, and verification.
For one stage, load the matching local skill:

| Need | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Full raw-video edit | `edit-video` |
| Silence removal | `cut-silences` |
| Retakes, false starts, or stutters | `cut-mistakes` |
| Narrative arc, persistent world, and visual callbacks | `video-storytelling` |
| Overlay beats, paper takeovers, and glass cards | `hyperframes-video-beats` |
| Select or extend styles and templates | `style-library` |
| HTML compositions and media timing | `hyperframes` |
| Preview, lint, and rendering | `hyperframes-cli` |
| Timeline animation | `gsap` |
| Install HyperFrames catalog blocks | `hyperframes-registry` |

Before a creative session read `MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md` and the project's DESIGN.md.
The philosophy's fast sizzle pacing is a style reference. Give educational speech
room to breathe. The project brief controls pacing, palette, and typography.
Framework skill contracts override historical code recipes in the style guide.

## Workspace

Create a project with `npm run new-video -- my-video`. Keep source media, EDLs,
transcripts, compositions, and renders together under `video-projects/<slug>/`.
Run HyperFrames from that project's directory. The root `scripts/` utilities
accept paths from the working directory. `style-library/registry.json` indexes
cards; each style has a DESIGN.md, CSS tokens, and named text slots.
See `style-templates/README.md` for whole-scene templates.

Preserve raw files. Use a new output filename for each editing stage. Archive
obsolete work. Video projects, personal footage, transcripts, credentials, and
renders are gitignored. A public kit contains reusable resources and synthetic
fixtures only. Never print secrets or copy private media into library examples.

## Editing and timing

Use ElevenLabs Scribe for transcription via `scripts/transcribe-elevenlabs.mjs`;
reuse existing word timestamps whenever possible. Audio is uploaded to ElevenLabs
and consumes the user's credits. Use their own locally configured credentials.
The synthetic demo requires no API key. Avoid implicit Whisper transcription.

Cut silences first; use its edited video AND retimed transcript for cut-mistakes.
Review each mistake in context. Intentional repetition is not a mistake. Record
the reviewed decisions before applying them. If no cuts are needed, preserve the
input or use an empty cuts list. Never mix original timestamps with edited footage.

Load the relevant skills before changing HTML. Root compositions use a visible
div with id, data-composition-id, data-start, duration, width, and height. Timed
elements carry data-start, data-duration, and data-track-index; same-track clips
must not overlap. Visible timed divs use class="clip"; videos do not.
Mute videos and use sibling audio for the mix. Animate a non-timed video wrapper.
Register one synchronous paused GSAP timeline per composition in window.__timelines
using its exact composition ID. Keep finite timelines and explicit durations.
HyperFrames owns media playback. Use deterministic animation and local assets.

## Verification and approvals

Run `node scripts/preflight.mjs <project>` and HyperFrames lint. For anchored
sub-compositions, run `node scripts/validate-beat-sync.mjs <project>`; each beat
needs data-anchor with an exact transcript phrase. Enter between 0.2 seconds after
and 1.8 seconds before that word. Inline timelines require manual timing review.

Review Studio before draft rendering. Review the encoded draft, extract and
inspect hero frames and transition boundaries, and listen to the audio joins.
Check cropped faces, overflow, black flashes, readable labels, clipping, and A/V
sync. Resolve problems before the final render. Save evidence in VERIFY.md.
Use a Range-capable preview server for MP4 scrubbing (for example `npx serve`).

Honor approvals already provided. When review approval is missing, prepare the
concrete preview or cut proposal first. Never claim a lint result proves visual
quality. Only publish or upload a finished video when the user authorizes it.
Automated browser checks must be headless, with Pointer Lock and cursor capture
disabled; synthetic input must remain inside the virtual browser.
