# AGENTS.md - Fusion Studio

> Agent-focused orientation for Fusion Studio. This repository is the development checkout for the Fusion Studio desktop workspace app.

## Current Identity

Fusion Studio is an Electron + React + Node.js workspace application for managing project folders, AI-assisted chat threads, wiki/docs/views, file exploration, and local system resources.

It is not a model provider. AI work is delegated to configured harnesses such as OpenCode or other CLI/service adapters. Fusion Studio owns the workspace shell, persistence, routing, rendering, and orchestration around those harnesses.

## Repository Layout

```

## Active Code Paths

| Area | Path |
|------|------|
| Renderer UI | `fusion-studio-client/src/` |
| Electron main/preload | `fusion-studio-client/electron/` |
| Server | `fusion-studio-server/` |
| Server libraries | `fusion-studio-server/lib/` |
| Current Chat architecture source of truth | `ai/views/wiki-viewer/Wiki/007-Chat_System/000-Overview_and_References/PAGE.md` |
| Project overview | `docs/FUSION_STUDIO_OVERVIEW.md` |
| Architecture outline | `docs/FUSION_STUDIO_ARCHITECTURE_OUTLINE.md` |

Do not use old client or server directory names. The active directories are `fusion-studio-client/` and `fusion-studio-server/`.

## Development Commands

### Client

```bash
cd fusion-studio-client
npm install
npm run build
npm run electron:dev
```

### Server

```bash
cd fusion-studio-server
npm install
node server.js
npm test
```

The Electron development path builds the renderer and starts the app shell, which manages the server process. When validating server code directly, use `fusion-studio-server/server.js`.

## Architecture Summary

Fusion Studio has three primary runtime layers:

| Layer | Path | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| Electron main | `fusion-studio-client/electron/` | Window lifecycle, native APIs, custom protocol, server child process |
| Renderer | `fusion-studio-client/src/` | React UI, Zustand stores, WebSocket client, iframe view mounting |
| Server | `fusion-studio-server/` | Business logic, SQLite, workspace registry, chat/thread routing, harness adapters, file/wiki/resource APIs |

The server owns persistence and orchestration. The renderer presents state and sends user intents. Electron provides local app integration and packages the client/server together.

## Chat And Harness Model

Read `ai/views/wiki-viewer/Wiki/007-Chat_System/000-Overview_and_References/PAGE.md` before changing chat, threads, harness routing, prompt acceptance, live stream rendering, or stop/interrupt behavior.

Current rules:

- `cli.json` is the harness policy. In the current default config, OpenCode is the only listed/enabled harness, so New Thread creates an OpenCode thread directly and no harness picker is shown.
- The persistent identity is the thread, not the workspace tab or current view.
- Passive browsing uses `thread:open`; it hydrates history and live snapshot state without warming or spawning a harness process.
- Assistant activation and new thread creation use `thread:open-assistant`.
- Prompt acceptance is server-owned. The user bubble is committed on `message:sent`, not on optimistic client send.
- Live streams route by `threadId`. Workspace and view context describe where the thread belongs, but `threadId` is the routing key.
- Active in-memory turns can be overlaid on top of SQLite history when a thread is revisited.
- Stop is server-owned. Interrupted turns persist as partial assistant exchanges instead of disappearing.

## Database

The server uses SQLite through Knex + `better-sqlite3`.

- Canonical DB module: `fusion-studio-server/lib/db.js`
- Dev DB path: `fusion-studio-server/data/fusion.db`
- Packaged/user-data DB path: `${FUSION_APP_USER_DATA}/server-data/fusion.db`
- Migrations: `fusion-studio-server/lib/db/migrations/`

Do not describe the current system as using any older database filename. The active database is `fusion.db`.

## Workspace And Views

Each workspace is a folder on disk with an `ai/` subtree. Fusion Studio reads workspace config, views, wiki content, styles, and state from that folder.
