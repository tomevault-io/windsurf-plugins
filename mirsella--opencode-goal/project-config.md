# Agent Notes

## npm publish workflow

- npm publishing is handled by GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
- It runs automatically when a GitHub Release is published (`on.release.types: [published]`).
- It can also be triggered manually with `workflow_dispatch`.
- Manual runs default to `dry_run: true`, so pass `dry_run=false` to actually publish:
  `gh workflow run publish.yml -f dry_run=false`
- The workflow skips `npm publish` when the current `name@version` is already on npm.
