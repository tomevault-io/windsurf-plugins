## Agent Definition Structure

Each agent file follows the standard Claude Code agent format:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of the agent's expertise and purpose
model: opus|sonnet (recommended model for the agent)
---

Agent instructions and specialized knowledge...
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Agent Creation**: Create new specialized agents by following the existing naming convention and structure
2. **Agent Organization**: Place agents in the appropriate category directory based on their primary function
3. **Agent Testing**: Use the `magento-code-reviewer` agent proactively for code quality assurance
4. **Version Control**: All agent definitions are tracked in Git for version control and collaboration

## Key Magento 2 Concepts

When working with these agents, they should be familiar with:
- Magento 2 module structure (`etc/`, `Model/`, `Block/`, `Controller/`, `view/`)
- Dependency injection and service contracts
- Plugin system and observers
- Layout XML and template hierarchy
- CLI commands and cron jobs
- API development (REST/GraphQL)
- Performance optimization (caching, indexing)
- Security best practices
- Theme development (Luma, Hyvä)
- Frontend technologies (RequireJS, KnockoutJS, Alpine.js)

## Agent Specialization

Each agent is designed to be highly specialized in their domain while maintaining awareness of Magento 2 best practices. The `code-reviewer` agent should be used proactively to ensure code quality across all development activities.
