# Copilot Instructions

- Read `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` before suggesting code, reviewing a PR, or answering repository-specific questions. Treat them as the source of truth.
- Start with `devdocs/pipeline-map.md` when you need architecture or data-flow context.
- Prefer repository code and local documentation over external references when they disagree.
- This repository provides eBPF-based instrumentation for applications and integrates with OpenTelemetry.
- Keep changes small, correct, and reviewable.
- Do not include unrelated cleanup, formatting changes, drive-by refactors, or broad rewrites.
- Follow existing package, subsystem, and repository boundaries unless the prompt explicitly asks to change them.
- Reuse existing helpers, utilities, abstractions, and patterns before introducing new ones.
- Do not edit generated files manually: `*_bpfel.go`, `*_bpfeb.go`, `*_bpfel.o`, `*_bpfeb.o`, or anything under `bpf/bpfcore/`.
- Prefer simple, explicit, readable code over clever or compact code.
- Keep functions small and focused, and use early returns when they improve readability.
- Avoid unnecessary interfaces, wrappers, layers, and hidden coupling.
- Keep comments minimal and only add context that the code itself cannot convey.
- Do not assume AI-generated code, plans, issue reports, or PR descriptions are correct. Check them against the repository before accepting them.
- Contributors are responsible for understanding and being able to explain every line they submit, including AI-assisted changes.
- When a change introduces a new helper, utility, abstraction, or pattern, check whether equivalent functionality already exists and prefer reuse.
- Refactors are acceptable only when they are directly relevant to the problem being solved.
- In reviews, prioritize signs of contributor ownership and repository-specific understanding over generic style commentary.
- In reviews, flag PR descriptions that sound generic, plan-like, or tool-generated and do not explain why the approach fits this repository.
- In reviews, flag duplicated implementations, oversized scope, unrelated cleanup, unnecessary abstractions, and changes that do not follow existing repository structure.
- In reviews, flag follow-up patches that appear to apply feedback mechanically without integrating it coherently into the surrounding code.
- In reviews, ask concrete questions about rationale, reuse of existing code, scope, validation, and why this approach is appropriate for this codebase.
- Do not object merely because AI may have been used. Object when the change shows weak ownership, weak understanding, duplication, unnecessary abstraction, poor integration, or missing validation.
