// Automated Release Pipeline
// Usage: Type "release" in cursor and it will run the full pipeline

When the user types "release", execute this pipeline:

1. Run `bun run build` to build the project
2. Check git status for changes
3. If there are changes:
   - Stage all changes with `git add .`
   - Generate a conventional commit message by analyzing the changes:
     - Use "feat:" for new features/functionality
     - Use "fix:" for bug fixes
     - Use "chore:" for maintenance, docs, build changes
     - Use "refactor:" for code restructuring
     - Include a brief description of what changed
4. Commit with the generated message
5. Run `npm version patch` to bump patch version
6. Push commits and tags with `git push && git push --tags`
7. Publish to NPM with `npm publish`

Before executing each step, briefly explain what you're about to do.
If any step fails, stop the pipeline and report the error.

Always confirm the final version number and ask if the user wants to proceed before publishing to NPM.
