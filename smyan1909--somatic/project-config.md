# SoMatic

Use SoMatic when you need to operate a native desktop UI with screenshots, mouse, and keyboard.

## How images reach you

**MCP path:** annotated screenshots arrive **inline** as image content in the tool response — you see the image directly, no extra step needed.

**CLI path:** `somatic screenshot --annotate` writes the annotated PNG to disk and returns its path in `screenshot.annotated_path`. Use the `Read` tool on that path to see the image. The JSON output is text only — use `Read` to get the actual image.

## Operating Loop

1. **At the start of a session, run `vision_init` (MCP) or `somatic vision init` (CLI).** This loads the YOLO ONNX model into a background daemon. First-ever run may take 1–3 minutes; subsequent runs are near-instant. Require `"started": true` (or `"already_running": true`) before continuing.

2. **Always begin a task by taking an annotated screenshot and visually inspecting it.**
   - MCP: call `screenshot_annotated` — the image arrives inline.
   - CLI: run `somatic screenshot --annotate`, then `Read` the path at `screenshot.annotated_path`.

3. **Scan the image before acting.** Check every region — taskbar, dock, desktop icons, system tray, open windows — and identify which numbered mark corresponds to the element you want.

4. **Prefer clicks on visible elements over keyboard navigation.** If the target is already present in the annotated screenshot (a taskbar icon, a tab, a button, a link), click its mark id. Do **not** open Start menu / Run / search when the thing you want is already on screen.

5. **Use the keyboard for what keyboards are for, not as a shortcut around looking.** Keyboard is the right tool for:
   - typing free-form text (`type_text "hello"`)
   - key chords that aren't UI elements (`hotkey ctrl s`, `press enter`, `hotkey alt tab`)
   - launching something that genuinely isn't visible anywhere (then use Win+S, type, screenshot the results, click the best match by mark id — don't blind-press Enter)

6. Inspect the JSON returned by the screenshot tool: `marks` contains `id`, `bbox`, `center`, and `confidence`. There are no captions — refer to elements by id and verify visually.

7. **Click by mark id. `click <id>` automatically clicks the center of that mark's bounding box — you never need to calculate or look up any pixel coordinates.**
   - `click 4` → clicks the center of mark 4's bbox automatically
   - `move 7` → moves the cursor to the center of mark 7's bbox automatically
   - `scroll -5 --target 2` → scrolls near mark 2 automatically
   - **NEVER extract `center` or `bbox` from the JSON and pass raw pixel coordinates like `click 540,320`. That defeats the purpose of mark ids. `click <id>` does it for you.**

8. When YOLO **doesn't** annotate the exact target — empty text inputs, fields that follow a labelled icon, gaps between buttons — use `click_near` with a `dx`/`dy` offset from the nearest visible mark:
   - `click_near 12 --dx 300 --dy 0` (300 px to the right of mark 12's center, automatically)

9. Use raw coordinates only as a last resort when **no mark and no nearby anchor exists at all**:
   - `click 640,420`

10. **Re-screenshot after every consequential action.** Mark IDs are reassigned per screenshot — never apply an id from one screenshot to another screenshot's state.

11. **At the end of the session, run `vision_stop`** to free the model's memory.

12. If something goes wrong, run `doctor` and `vision_status`.

## Decision Rule: Click, Click-Near, or Type?

When choosing how to advance the task, ask: *what does the latest annotated screenshot show?*

- **Target visible as a mark →** `click <id>`. SoMatic resolves the id to the bbox center for you. Don't calculate coordinates. Don't open a launcher.
- **Target NOT visible as a mark but adjacent to one →** `click_near <id> --dx ... --dy ...`. SoMatic resolves the anchor id to its center and applies your offset. (Common for text inputs that sit next to a `+` or send button.)
- **Target's container visible but not the target itself →** click into the container first, re-screenshot, then act on the new marks.
- **Target genuinely invisible →** keyboard shortcut (Win+S to search, Ctrl+L to focus URL bar, etc.). After the keypress, screenshot again before doing anything else.

**Anti-patterns — never do these:**

- ❌ `click 540,320` when you could use `click 4` — marks are already positioned at the right place
- ❌ Reading `center` from the marks JSON and passing those pixels to `click` — `click <id>` does this automatically
- ❌ Calculating coordinates by eyeballing the annotated image — `click <id>` is always more accurate

## Command Rules

- Treat command output as JSON, not prose.
- Use `--dry-run` before risky pointer or keyboard actions when planning a move.
- If a screenshot tool returns `vision_unavailable`, call `vision_init` and retry.
- Don't pre-emptively press Escape or click empty space to "clear state" — trust what the last screenshot shows.

## Common Commands

CLI form:

```sh
somatic doctor
somatic vision init
somatic vision status
somatic screenshot --annotate              # returns annotated_path; use Read to view
somatic click <id>
somatic click <x,y>
somatic click-near <id> --dx 100 --dy 0
somatic type "text"
