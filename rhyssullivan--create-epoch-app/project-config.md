Never use `any`, `unknown`, or TypeScript type casting.

This includes:
- The `any` type
- The `unknown` type
- Type assertions using `as` (e.g., `value as SomeType`)
- Type assertions using angle brackets (e.g., `<SomeType>value`)

Types should be correct and properly inferred or explicitly defined. If you find yourself needing to cast types, refactor the code to use proper type definitions, type guards, or type narrowing instead.
