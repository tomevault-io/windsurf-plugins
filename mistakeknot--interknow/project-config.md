scripts/bump-version.sh <version>   # bump, commit, push, publish
```

## Overview

**interknow** is a durable pattern repository with provenance tracking, temporal decay, and semantic retrieval. Every pattern discovered once should be discoverable forever.

**Problem:** Knowledge discovered during reviews and debugging is trapped in conversation context. Same mistakes get rediscovered across sessions. No structured way to accumulate durable patterns.

**Solution:** Two skills (compound + recall), provenance-tracked knowledge entries, and optional semantic search via qmd MCP server.

**Plugin Type:** Claude Code skill + MCP server plugin
**Current Version:** 0.1.0

## Provenance Model

Each knowledge entry tracks its source:
- **`independent`** — discovered without prior prompting (high confidence)
- **`primed`** — discovered after being reminded of a similar pattern (lower confidence, needs independent confirmation)

This prevents feedback loops where Claude keeps "discovering" patterns it was told about.

## Decay Rules

- 10 reviews without independent confirmation → archive
- Archived entries remain discoverable but are deprioritized in recall

## How It Works

### `/interknow:compound`
Write a knowledge entry: domain tag, evidence anchors (file:line), provenance source, generalized heuristic (no repo-specific paths).

### `/interknow:recall`
Query knowledge for a topic. Domain-aware filtering narrows results. Returns matching entries ranked by relevance and recency.

### SessionStart Hook
Reports knowledge stats as `additionalContext`: `"interknow: N knowledge entries (M archived)"`.

### qmd MCP Server
Optional semantic search via `vsearch` tool. Launched via `scripts/launch-qmd.sh`. Gracefully exits if `qmd` not installed (`bun install -g @tobilu/qmd`). Skills work without it (reduced to filename/heading matching). Source: https://github.com/tobi/qmd

## Integration Points

| Tool | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| interflux | Primary consumer — interknow was extracted from interflux's knowledge layer |
| intermem | intermem promotes memory → docs; interknow stores durable patterns (complementary) |
| qmd | External semantic search binary; optional dependency with graceful fallback |

## Testing

```bash
cd tests && uv run pytest -q
```

## Known Constraints

- qmd is an optional external dependency — semantic search degrades gracefully without it
- Knowledge entries must be sanitized (generalized heuristics only, no repo-specific paths)
- Decay threshold (10 reviews) is hardcoded in the compound skill
