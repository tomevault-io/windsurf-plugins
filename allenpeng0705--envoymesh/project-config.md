description: Mobile app is EnvoyGo (Flutter). Capacitor apps/mobile backup stack was removed.

# Mobile app identity (do not confuse)

**The product mobile app is EnvoyGo:** `apps/envoygo/` (Flutter thin client).

When a task says "mobile", "phone", "iOS", "Android", or "EnvoyGo":
- Work in **`apps/envoygo/`**
- Pair to the home node via QR; call home JSON-RPC through `NodeServiceClient` / `HomeRemoteClient`
- Do **not** recreate the removed Capacitor backup (`apps/mobile/`) unless the user explicitly asks for it

**The Capacitor backup stack (`apps/mobile/` + `packages/mobile-node` / `mobile-storage` / `mobile-vault`) was removed** (Phase 11 experiment). `packages/mobile-identity` remains and is **required**: it is the browser-safe pure-JS Ed25519 (`@noble/curves`) that the Social web app's Vite build aliases as `@envoymesh/identity` — do not delete it.
