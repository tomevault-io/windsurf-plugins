# Cursor Rules

You are working in a project that follows a strict Task Documentation System.

## Task System
- **Source of Truth**: The `docs/tasks/` directory contains the state of all work.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Check context: `./scripts/tasks context`
    2. Create task if needed: `./scripts/tasks create ...`
    3. Update status: `./scripts/tasks update ...`
- **Reference**: See `docs/tasks/GUIDE.md` for details.

## Tools
- Use `./scripts/tasks` for all task operations.
- Use `--format json` if you need to parse output.
