# Agent Instructions

## Verification Policy

- Do not run tests, builds, formatters, package installs, or dev servers unless the user explicitly asks.
- If verification seems necessary, ask the user first and briefly explain why.
- For code changes, inspect the diff and report what was changed, along with any tests or builds that were not run.
- Prefer targeted inspection over broad verification unless the user approves a broader check.
