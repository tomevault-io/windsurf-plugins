# Python Development Standards

Based on the Google Python Style Guide with project-specific additions.

## Imports
- Use `import x` for packages and modules only, not for individual classes or functions
- Import modules: `import pathlib` and reference `pathlib.Path` instead of `from pathlib import Path`
- Importing with alias is acceptable: `import a.b.c as c`
- Use full package names to avoid conflicts: `from sound.effects import echo`
- Exceptions: typing, collections.abc, and typing_extensions symbols can be imported directly

## Type Annotations
- Use Pydantic models for all data structures that need validation

## Comments and Docstrings
- Keep comments minimal - explain WHY not WHAT
- Use comments only when the reasoning behind code isn't obvious
  - And, prefer to rewrite the code to be clearer instead of leaving such comments
- Write docstrings when it isn't clear what a function does from its name and arguments, or for functions that are part of the public interface of some component of the system

## Naming Conventions
- Avoid single character names except for counters or iterators
- Use descriptive names: `employee_ids` not `e_ids`

## Language Features
- Use list/dict/set comprehensions for simple cases
- Use generators for large data processing
- Properties: use `@property` for simple attribute access
- Lambda functions: only for one-liners, otherwise use regular functions
- Conditional expressions: use sparingly for simple cases
- Avoid global state except for module-level constants

## Error Handling
- Document exceptions raised by a method using a "Raises" section in the docstring

## Best Practices
- Use parentheses for line continuation, not backslashes
