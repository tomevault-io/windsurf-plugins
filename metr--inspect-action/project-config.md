# API Development Patterns

- Use FastAPI dependency injection for shared resources
- Define Pydantic models for all request and response bodies
- Use async def for all endpoint handlers
- Use the `validate_access_token` middleware (automatically added to all endpoints) for authentication
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (201 for creation, 204 for deletion, etc.)
- Include proper OpenAPI documentation in endpoints
