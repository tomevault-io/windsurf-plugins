# Kubernetes Operations

- **Important**: We use a Helm chart to create Kubernetes objects. Add new resources to the Helm chart instead of creating them directly with the k8s client
  - The Helm chart is located at `hawk/api/helm_chart/`
- The Hawk API server uses pyhelm3 (https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/pyhelm3) to execute Helm commands. Under the hood, this delegates to the helm CLI
- Only the API server should execute Helm commands using pyhelm3. No other component should do that
