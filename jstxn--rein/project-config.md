# rein-retro

Use this after a miss, failed check, or suspicious shortcut.

## Steps

1. State what failed.
2. Identify the false assumption or missed search step.
3. Classify the miss:
   - bluffing
   - incomplete search
   - insufficient verification
   - reward hacking
   - other
4. State what evidence would have prevented the miss.
5. Propose one concrete protocol improvement.

## Output

Emit a short retro note with:

- failure
- root assumption
- miss classification
- missing evidence
- rule or prompt update to add back into the harness
