# rein-triage

Use this before editing when the task is ambiguous, broad, risky, or likely to touch multiple files.

## Steps

1. Read the task and identify the most likely relevant files.
2. State the top assumptions.
3. Separate verified facts from unverified assumptions.
4. Define what success looks like.
5. Define what would count as cheating, bluffing, or reward hacking.
6. If the task is impossible or conflicting, stop and report the conflict instead of forcing a pass.

## Output

Emit a short triage note with:

- relevant files
- verified assumptions
- open assumptions
- success definition
- cheating boundary
- stop-and-report trigger, if any
