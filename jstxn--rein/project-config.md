# rein-review

Use this after implementation and before committing to review your own diff for problems that verification commands alone will not catch.

## When To Use

- Before any commit that touches more than a trivial change
- After a multi-file implementation pass
- When you are about to declare work complete

## When Not To Use

- The change is a single-line typo fix with no surrounding edits
- rein-verify has already been run and covers diff review (avoid duplication)

## Steps

1. Read the full diff (staged and unstaged).
2. For every changed file, verify you read it before editing it.
3. Check for unrelated changes:
   - files modified that are not part of the task
   - formatting-only changes in files you did not need to touch
   - import reordering or whitespace changes outside the task scope
4. Check for debug leftovers:
   - console.log, print, debugger statements
   - commented-out code that should be removed
   - TODO/FIXME comments added without justification
5. Check for test and fixture integrity:
   - tests removed or weakened without explanation
   - assertions loosened (exact match to contains, strict to loose)
   - test data changed to make failures disappear
   - new tests that only assert the happy path
6. Check for scope drift:
   - refactors beyond what the task required
   - new abstractions or helpers for one-time use
   - feature additions not in the original scope
7. If any issue is found, fix it before committing.
8. If all checks pass, state what was reviewed and confirm the diff is clean.

## Output

Emit a short review note with:

- files reviewed
- issues found (if any) and how they were resolved
- confirmation that the diff is limited to the task scope
- any caveats or remaining concerns
