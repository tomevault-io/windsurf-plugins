# rein-verify

Use this before final completion.

## Steps

1. Discover the repository standard:
   - build
   - typecheck
   - lint
   - format
   - test
2. Run every applicable verification command.
3. Inspect the diff for unrelated edits, debug leftovers, and suspicious test or evaluator changes.
4. If tests, fixtures, or evaluators changed, explain why.
5. Emit a final evidence report.
6. Refuse to declare success without evidence.

## Evidence Report

Report:

- files read
- assumptions verified
- commands run
- tests added or changed
- remaining uncertainties
- why the solution is not reward hacking
