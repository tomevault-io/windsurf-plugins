description: Understand a codebase and maintain .rein/codebase/ as a navigable map with evidence-backed findings

# rein-inspect

`rein-inspect` is a documentation-first reconnaissance skill. Its job is to understand a codebase carefully and maintain a durable map of that understanding under `.rein/codebase/`.

The skill produces:
- `.rein/codebase/MAP.md`
- topical companion docs under `.rein/codebase/`

It observes and records. It does not recommend fixes.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- you need a high-signal map of an unfamiliar repo or subsystem
- a project has grown beyond what one README can orient cleanly
- you want durable codebase reference docs for future agents or humans
- repeated work keeps re-discovering the same architecture or boundary facts

## Do Not Use

Do not use this skill when:
- the user asked for implementation, refactoring, or repair rather than inspection
- the repo already has a maintained codebase map that only needs a tiny manual update
- you only need a quick one-turn explanation instead of persistent docs
- you are not prepared to read enough of the codebase to support the claims you write

## Operating Boundaries

- Read before writing.
- Follow actual code evidence, not guessed architecture.
- Keep output rooted at `.rein/codebase/`.
- Preserve and update existing docs in place.
- Add a new topical doc only when the inspected codebase reveals a real uncovered area.
- Record observations and evidence-backed inferred risks.
- Do not propose fixes, refactors, or migrations.
- Do not edit application code as part of this skill unless the user explicitly asked for code changes outside the inspection pass.

## Output Contract

Always maintain this docs tree:

```text
.rein/
  codebase/
    MAP.md
    <topic>.md
    <topic>.md
```

`MAP.md` is the entrypoint. It should explain the major sections of the codebase and link to the topical docs.

Topical docs should be created from discovered domains, not a hard-coded list. Examples might include:
- `architecture.md`
- `frontend.md`
- `backend.md`
- `data-flow.md`
- `testing.md`
- `tooling.md`

The exact set depends on the repo.

## Procedure

1. Establish scope
   - If the caller provides a subsystem or path, inspect that area first and expand only as needed to explain its boundaries.
   - If no scope is provided, inspect the full repo structure.

2. Discover the repo shape
   - Read root docs and configuration first.
   - Identify major runtime surfaces, packages, apps, libraries, services, tooling, tests, and infrastructure.
   - Trace how the main entrypoints connect to the rest of the codebase.

3. Group the codebase into stable domains
   - Create topical docs around real boundaries in the codebase.
   - Prefer a few meaningful docs over a file-by-file dump.
   - Use names that describe actual responsibilities.

4. Read enough to support each claim
   - Verify architecture statements against code.
   - Confirm patterns by reading representative files, not one isolated example.
   - Confirm fallbacks, failure paths, and important conditionals before documenting them.

5. Write or update `MAP.md`
   - Summarize the major domains.
   - Link to each topical doc.
   - Explain what each doc is for.
   - Keep it navigational, not verbose.

6. Write or update topical docs
   - Preserve useful existing material when it remains accurate.
   - Update stale sections in place.
   - Add a new topical doc when the current set does not cover an important discovered domain.

7. Review for drift
   - Remove claims that are not supported by what you read.
   - Remove recommendation language.
   - Check that the map and topical docs still agree with each other.

## Required Structure For Each Topical Doc

Each generated topical doc should use this minimum structure:

```text
# <Topic>

## What This Area Does
- concise responsibility summary

## Key Paths
- important directories, files, or entrypoints

## How It Works
- main flows, control paths, or lifecycle notes

## Patterns And Conventions
- repeated local patterns, boundaries, and best practices embodied in the code

## Dependencies And Touchpoints
- what this area depends on
- what depends on it

## Findings
- observed findings
- evidence-backed inferred risks
```

Keep sections concise. Expand only when the code actually justifies it.

## Findings Discipline

`Findings` may include:
- direct observations from the code
- evidence-backed inferred risks
- notable fallbacks
- likely regression-sensitive paths

`Findings` must not include:
- fix proposals
- refactor advice
- migration plans
- generic style opinions detached from the repo

When writing an inferred risk:
- tie it to the code evidence that led to it
- state it as a risk or likely consequence, not as a fact you did not verify
- stop before prescribing a remedy

The model is expert inspection: understand carefully, note what is there, note what looks risky, and hand over the notes.

## Quality Bar

The output is good enough when:
- `.rein/codebase/MAP.md` gives a reliable starting point for navigating the repo
- each topical doc reflects a real architectural or functional boundary
- descriptions explain behavior and responsibilities, not just filenames
- findings are grounded and useful without drifting into advice
- repeat runs improve the docs without trashing prior useful structure
