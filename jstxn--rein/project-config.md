# rein-plan

Use this after triage and before implementation when the work involves multiple files, multiple concerns, or a non-obvious execution order.

## When To Use

- The task touches more than two files or modules
- The execution order matters (migrations before code, types before consumers)
- There are dependencies between subtasks
- The risk of a partial implementation is high
- A completed `rein-interview` spec bundle already exists and should drive the plan

## When Not To Use

- The task is a single-file, single-concern change
- Triage already produced a clear, linear path
- The user explicitly asks to skip planning

## Interview Handoff

Before planning, check whether there is a completed `rein-interview` artifact to consume.

Artifact priority:
1. If the user provides `--from-interview <slug|path>`, use that artifact.
2. If the user provides or references a `rein interview handoff --to plan` result, use its `sourceResult` and `recommendedSkillInvocation`.
3. Otherwise, look under `.rein/specs/` for `rein-interview-*/result.json`.
4. If one clearly matches the current task, use it.
5. If several plausible artifacts exist, prefer the most recent completed one whose `intent`, `desiredOutcome`, or `inScope` matches the task.
6. If no relevant artifact exists, proceed with normal planning.

When a `result.json` artifact is available:
- treat it as the primary source of truth for intent, desired outcome, in-scope, out-of-scope, constraints, acceptance criteria, assumptions, technical context, and execution bridge
- use `spec.md` or the transcript only if `result.json` is insufficient
- do not silently drift away from the artifact without naming the conflict
- if the live repo facts conflict with the artifact, call out the mismatch in the plan
- if the artifact is missing core planning fields, stop and report that the interview bundle is incomplete rather than planning from a hollow result

## Steps

1. Load the relevant `rein-interview` `result.json` first when available.
2. List every discrete subtask required to complete the work.
3. Identify dependencies between subtasks. Order them so each step has its prerequisites satisfied.
4. Write each step in `change -> verify` form.
5. For each step, state:
   - what changes
   - why this is the minimum sufficient change
   - what must stay untouched
   - what could go wrong
   - how to verify the step succeeded before moving on
6. Reject speculative abstraction, flexibility, or helper extraction unless the plan explicitly justifies it.
7. Identify the first safe checkpoint — the earliest point where the repo is in a valid state and work can be paused or reviewed.
8. Identify rollback boundaries — points where a partial revert is clean rather than destructive.
9. Flag any step that requires a decision the user has not yet made.

## Output

Emit a plan with:

- ordered step list with per-step minimum-sufficient change, scope boundary, risk, and verification
- dependency graph (if non-linear)
- checkpoints
- rollback boundaries
- open decisions requiring user input
- estimated blast radius (files touched, APIs changed, tests affected)
- when an interview artifact was used, a short note naming the `result.json` input and the key handoff fields consumed
