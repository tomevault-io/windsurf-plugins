# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**ArgoPlane** is a collection of ArgoCD UI extensions. It surfaces operational data — metrics, logs, network flows, vulnerabilities, events — inside ArgoCD's UI as resource tabs, app views, and status panels. Each extension is independent and can be deployed on its own.

## Core Idea

Developers deploying through ArgoCD can see if their app is synced. What they can't see: logs, alerts, network flows, or policy violations. ArgoPlane extensions surface that operational visibility directly in ArgoCD.

Extensions fall into two categories:

- **Observe**: workload visibility (metrics, logs, traces, alerts, networking, events)
- **Secure**: security and compliance (policies, certificates)

## Architecture

### Extension Pattern

Every ArgoPlane extension follows the same pattern:

1. **React/TypeScript UI extension** registered via `window.extensionsAPI` (resource tabs, status panels, system-level pages, app views, top bar actions)
2. **Go backend service** that queries the underlying system (Prometheus, Cilium, Loki, etc.)
3. **ArgoCD proxy extension** that routes `/extensions/<name>/*` requests from the UI to the Go backend

### Key Components

- **ArgoCD v3.3.3**: GitOps engine, UI host, RBAC, proxy extension routing
- **Prometheus**: Metrics and alerts (metrics + alerts extensions)
- **Loki**: Log aggregation (logs extension)
- **Cilium/Hubble**: Network visibility (networking extension)
- **Trivy Operator**: Image vulnerability scanning, config audit, exposed secrets, SBOM (vulnerabilities extension)
- **Kyverno**: Policy enforcement (policies extension, planned)
- **Tempo/Jaeger**: Distributed tracing (traces extension, future)
- **cert-manager**: Certificate lifecycle (certificates extension, future)

### Multi-Tenancy

Extensions rely on ArgoCD's native RBAC and AppProjects for tenant isolation. Identity headers (`Argocd-Username`, `Argocd-User-Id`, `Argocd-User-Groups`) are passed to backend services by ArgoCD's proxy.

### State

No database. All state comes from Kubernetes (ArgoCD Applications, CRDs, operator resources) and upstream systems (Prometheus, Loki, Hubble, etc.).

## Current Scope

**Done:** Metrics (Prometheus), Networking (Cilium/Hubble), Logs (Loki), Vulnerabilities (Trivy Operator), Events (Kubernetes Events API)

**Removed:** Backups (Velero) — deprecated and removed in v1.5.0; the extension saw no real usage.

**Next:** Alerts (Prometheus Rules / Alertmanager), Policies (Kyverno)

**Future:** Traces (Tempo/Jaeger), Certificates (cert-manager), Scaling (HPA/KEDA)

See [`docs/extension-roadmap.md`](docs/extension-roadmap.md) for details.

## Development

```sh
make dev-infra       # Create kind cluster + install ArgoCD (idempotent)
make argocd-password # Print admin password
make argocd-portforward  # Port-forward UI to localhost:8080
make test-integration    # Run integration tests
make clean-all           # Destroy everything
```

## Commands

- `make help` shows all available targets
- `make cluster` creates the kind cluster (idempotent)
- `make argocd` installs ArgoCD in the cluster (idempotent)
- `make dev-infra` sets up the full local stack
- `make build-extensions` builds all UI extension bundles
- `make build-backends` builds all backend Docker images
- `make build-ui-extensions-image` builds the UI extensions init container image
- `make load-extensions` loads backend + UI extensions images into kind
- `make setup-argocd` configures ArgoCD + deploys extensions + loads UI bundles (all-in-one)
