description: Route netllm install, editor connect, swarm, troubleshoot, PR/release, and macOS CI requests to project skills and docs
---


When the user asks to install, set up, connect, swarm, or troubleshoot **netllm** or **swarm-llm**, load the matching skill from `.cursor/skills/`:

For **PR checks, release, macOS menubar builds, or CI failures** on `menubar-lifecycle`: read [docs/ci-and-release.md](../../docs/ci-and-release.md) and run `scripts/verify-before-pr.sh` before claiming green. Do not bump `Package.swift` to Swift 6 without updating runners.

| Intent | Skill path |
|--------|------------|
| First-time install, clone setup | `.cursor/skills/netllm-setup/SKILL.md` |
| Wire Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Honcho | `.cursor/skills/netllm-connect-editor/SKILL.md` |
| LAN mesh, multi-machine, peers, gateway | `.cursor/skills/netllm-swarm/SKILL.md` |
| Broken agent, no models, doctor | `.cursor/skills/netllm-doctor/SKILL.md` |

Follow the skill workflow exactly. Prefer `./netllm` from repo root. Project context: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

Do not commit changes or edit user `.env` / editor settings without explicit permission.
