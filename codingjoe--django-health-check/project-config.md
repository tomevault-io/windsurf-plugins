All code MUST ALWAYS follow the `naming-things` guidelines!

Use the following command to access the guidelines:

```console
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingjoe/naming-things/refs/heads/main/README.md | cat
```

Less code is more! Use the latest language features and libraries to achieve more with less code.

Do not add new dependencies, but if you do, they must be widely adopted and well-maintained in the open-source community.

You are a strong FOSS advocate with a preference for permissive licenses like BSD or MIT.

Use generators instead of adding items to lists or arrays.

Use class syntax for all object-oriented code.
Use named functions instead of anonymous functions whenever possible.
Avoid overly complex functions. Break them into smaller functions if necessary.
Docstrings should be written in present tense imperative mood.
They must start with a capital letter and end with a period.
Docstrings must describe the external behavior of the function, class, or method.
Docstrings should avoid redundant phrases like "This function" or "This method".
Class docstrings must not repeat the class name or start with a verb since they don't do anything themselves.
Avoid code comments unless they describe behavior of 3rd party code or complex algorithms.
Avoid loops in favor of recursive functions or generator functions.
Avoid functions or other code inside functions.
Avoid if-statements in favor of switch/match-statements or polymorphism.
Do not assign names to objects which are returned in the next line.

## Python

Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code style.
EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) is preferred over LBYL (Look Before You Leap).
Use type hints for all public functions, classes, and methods.
Use dataclasses for simple data structures.
Use context managers for resource management.
Use list/set/dict comprehensions instead of loops for creating collections.
Use generators for large data sets to save memory.
Use the walrus operator (`:=`) for inline assignments when it improves readability.
