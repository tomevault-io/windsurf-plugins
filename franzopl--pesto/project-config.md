## Project Overview (2026)

This repository is now a **Cargo Workspace** containing five main crates:

- **`pesto`** — Core library + lightweight high-performance CLI (`pesto`); posting only
- **`upapasta`** — Full-featured Rust application with rich TUI, catalog, watch mode, metadata, and orchestration (replaces the old Python version)
- **`parmesan`** — High-performance PAR2 library (create, verify, repair)
- **`penne`** — NZB downloader CLI/engine: reads a `.nzb`, fetches articles over NNTP, reassembles files, verifies/repairs with PAR2 (see `crates/penne/ROADMAP.md`)
- **`sugo`** — SABnzbd-API-compatible web UI (`askama` + htmx) built on top of `penne` as a library; see `crates/sugo/README.md`

`upapasta` uses the `pesto` library **directly** via Rust API (no subprocess calls or JSON parsing).
`penne` likewise reuses `pesto` as a library (`.nzb` parsing, NNTP connection/auth) and `parmesan`
(via `pesto::par2`) rather than duplicating that logic. `sugo` reuses `penne` the same way —
one background job engine driving `penne`'s own pipeline functions directly, no subprocess calls.

### Current Focus (Phase 40b+)

We are now developing **UpaPasta v2 in Rust**. The Python version in `/home/francisco/dev/franzopl/upapasta` is considered legacy and will be retired once feature parity is reached.
`penne` (branch `penne-dev`) is a parallel, independent effort — see its own `ROADMAP.md` for phasing.

## Architecture Principles

- **`pesto`** remains minimal, extremely fast, and focused on the hot path (yEnc → article → NNTP pipeline). Posting only — it never downloads.
- **`upapasta`** is responsible for UX, business logic, catalog, watch mode, metadata enrichment (TMDb, NFO), and orchestration. It uploads and catalogues; it does not download Usenet content.
- **`penne`** owns everything download-side: NZB parsing for retrieval, article fetch, yEnc decode, file assembly, PAR2 verify/repair, archive extraction. **`sugo`** is the SABnzbd-like web UI on top of it, as its own separate crate (never code embedded in `penne` itself) — see `crates/sugo/README.md`.
- All shared types, config, and progress events live in `pesto` (as public API); `penne` reuses them instead of redefining its own NZB/NNTP primitives where the semantics are identical.
- Prefer **direct library integration** over CLI spawning in `upapasta` and `penne`.
- TUI must be responsive, keyboard-driven, and pleasant to use daily.

## Design Principles (Updated)

- **Performance first** in `pesto`, **excellent UX** in `upapasta`.
- Keep `pesto` CLI minimal. Complex features belong in `upapasta`.
- Use `ratatui` + `crossterm` for the TUI.
- All new code in `upapasta` must be async-friendly and integrate cleanly with `pesto::post()`.
- Maintain compatibility with existing user configuration where possible.

```

## Development Workflow (UpaPasta v2)

When working on `upapasta`:

1. Always check neighboring files for style, component patterns, and naming.
2. Use existing `pesto` public API instead of reimplementing upload logic.
3. Prefer `ratatui` widgets and state management patterns already established.
4. Run `cargo check -p upapasta` and `cargo clippy -p upapasta` frequently.
5. Keep the TUI responsive even during long uploads (use channels for progress).

**Pre-commit checklist for upapasta:**

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo check -p upapasta
cargo test -p upapasta
```

## Legacy Notes

The old Python implementation (`/home/francisco/dev/franzopl/upapasta`) should only be referenced for understanding desired UX and feature list. Do not port code directly — reimplement idiomatically in Rust.

## Design principles

- **Speed first.** The hot path is: read file → yEnc → send over the NNTP
  connection. Avoid needless allocations, buffer copies and lock contention on
  that path. Prefer streaming I/O over loading whole files into memory.
- **Connection-pool concurrency.** Throughput comes from N parallel NNTP
  connections posting articles simultaneously. That is the core architecture,
  not an add-on.
- **Minimal scope.** Before adding a flag or option, ask whether it is
  fundamental to posting files. If not, it waits until after the MVP.
- **Fail clearly.** Network, authentication and I/O errors must produce
  actionable messages, not panics.

## Current Focus (Phase 40b)

We are implementing a clean, responsive TUI in `upapasta` using `ratatui`.

**Preferred patterns in upapasta:**
- Use `App` struct with `State` for screens (Dashboard, FileBrowser, History, etc.)
- Prefer event-driven architecture with `crossterm` event stream
