# Agent instructions

This repository is an **agent skill**. The full instructions live in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) —
read that first and follow it; this file exists so agents that look for `AGENTS.md` by
convention (Codex among them) find their way there.

## What it does

Turn one photo of a real place into a scroll-scrubbed hero where the camera holds still and the subject transforms.

## Start with the interview, not the flags

The user is not expected to know what a keyframe is, what first/last-frame tweening means, or
what `--mode pro` buys. **Part 1 of [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) is a nine-question interview** — three
batched rounds — that collects the decisions they actually have, phrased as outcomes and priced.
Run it before touching a script. Never ask someone to pick a flag value.

The interview also settles the budget, which matters because the flags it sets are the difference
between a ~$1.55 run and a ~$8.68 one. Show the forecast and wait for a yes before generating.

## Before you run anything

This file uses the same working-directory contract as [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md), because the two
hand off to each other mid-run and a different one here would leave the user's files in the wrong
place. It is: **one scratch directory outside the skill folder, plus `$SKILL` pointing at the
skill folder.** Set both before the first command.

```bash
mkdir -p myproject/.scrub-hero/jones && cd myproject/.scrub-hero/jones
SKILL="/absolute/path/to/scroll-scrub-hero"        # the folder holding SKILL.md - see below
```

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force myproject\.scrub-hero\jones | Out-Null
Set-Location myproject\.scrub-hero\jones
$SKILL = "C:\absolute\path\to\scroll-scrub-hero"
```

`$SKILL` is the directory holding `SKILL.md`, which you are already reading — use that path,
do not copy one from a README. `~/.claude/skills/` is Claude Code; Codex installs to
`~/.codex/skills/` globally or `.agents/skills/` per project, and the wrong one fails on the
first command with `Cannot find module`. `node "$SKILL/scripts/doctor.mjs"` prints the correct
line for the machine it is on, and refuses to run if `$SKILL` disagrees with where it lives.

Never run the scripts with the skill folder as the working directory. Their outputs
(`storyboard.json`, `keyframes/`, `segments/`) are written relative to the cwd, so doing that
scatters run artifacts through the user's installed skill — and `storyboard.mjs` has no cache, so
the re-run after you move them is a second billed Sol call.

Then preflight. It works from any directory:

```bash
node "$SKILL/scripts/doctor.mjs"
```

It checks Node 18+, ffmpeg, ffprobe, that this ffmpeg has the libwebp encoder the last stage
needs, the `KIE_API_KEY` environment variable, whether kie.ai accepts that key, and whether every
route the pipeline calls still exists — then prints the exact fix for whatever is missing. It
also prints the user's credit balance and what a default run costs, which is the one check that
catches the worst failure this pipeline has: running dry halfway, with the finished stages paid
for and no hero to show. Run it before the first command in any session; the alternative is
discovering a missing dependency partway through a run that has already cost the user money.

## Things worth knowing before you drive this

**It spends the user's money.** Two steps call paid APIs. Both ask for confirmation, and both
take `--yes` because there is no keyboard when an agent is running them. Only pass `--yes`
once the user has actually approved — treat it as signing for the cost, not as boilerplate.
Both gates print a priced estimate with its source and the account balance before asking, so
"approved" should mean the user saw a number. A third step, `storyboard.mjs`, spends without a
gate; it is under four cents and it prints the forecast for the whole run first.

**Quote figures from the scripts, not from memory.** `node "$SKILL/scripts/pricing.mjs"` prints
the rate table with the page each rate was read from. Rates are dated estimates, not quotes, and
what actually gets recorded is kie.ai's own `creditsConsumed` per item. When you report what a
run cost, report the measured figure from `_state.json`, not the estimate you quoted up front.

**There is a human gate in the middle, and it is not optional.** The pipeline renders every
still first and stops at a contact sheet. Do not start the expensive step until the user has
looked at it and said go, and do not offer to "just try one" to see — that is how a run
quietly costs several times what it should.

**Stay in the one scratch directory.** Each step writes a `_state.json` beside its output; that
state is what lets an interrupted run resume instead of re-paying for finished work. Use
absolute paths for anything outside the working directory rather than `cd`-ing mid-run — that is
why the scripts are invoked as `"$SKILL/scripts/<name>.mjs"` and never as bare `scripts/…`.

**Never print the API key.** It is read from the environment only. Do not echo it, do not write
it into a file in the user's repo, and do not include it in a command you show them.

## First command

Once the interview has settled the steps, quality and aspect ratio, and the user has seen the
