# AGENTS.md — Symphony Forge

## What This Repo Is

Symphony Forge is a dual-runtime software-factory template for turning in-repo architecture and decision docs into shipped applications.

It provides:
- planner-owned decomposition
- bounded implementation tasks
- deterministic verification
- schema-validated evidence recording
- autoreview-owned review
- PR-ready proof artifacts

## Context and Read Order

Read the nearest `AGENTS.md`, the active brief, the binding decisions and
contracts, and the source and tests affected by the current request. A new or
changed capability also reads the applicable architecture, confirmed specs,
product brief, active decisions, roadmap, plan, and decomposition. Status,
Lite, and prepared correction work does not reread unrelated canon; the
constitution and accepted contracts remain binding for every executor.

## Runtime Modes

Claude uses protected `codex-plugin-cc`; native Codex uses host `spawn_agent`. `forge delegate` validates and prepares briefs; native dispatch passes no model/reasoning override. Raw/nested `codex exec` and direct plugin shell launch are denied for manual delegation. Autoreview is an external black box and may use Codex or agents. Forge keeps task/worktree/scope/proof/PR gates without native process/PID/lifecycle lock or attribution.

## Phase Contract

Follow `WORKFLOW.md` for discovery through PR delivery and `docs/FACTORY.md`
for the factory reference. Sign-off requires confirmed specs and a derived
roadmap; implementation requires an approved plan and recorded decomposition.

## Prompt and Agent Use

Prompt files under `factory/prompts/` are phase contracts; hooks load context and enforce gates. Native Codex uses configured role subagents for task work and cold grills. Put each full descriptor and its context metadata in the actual spawn message, then record the exact grill result. See [shared Forge guidance](factory/skills/forge.md#codex-native-use-host-subagents).

Use the host's structured request tool for every supported user question. Claude
plan authority is a successful `ExitPlanMode`; Codex plan authority is the
digest-bound synchronous approval in `docs/specs/plan-approval.md`. Direct chat
never substitutes for plan authority.

Default specialist set:
- `planner-high`
- `docs-decomposer`
- `functional-checker` (user-facing tasks only)
- autoreview skill (review — three lenses, one run; 0078)

Testing has no separate agent: the implementer writes and records the tests.

## Reasoning Defaults

Main coordinator model/reasoning are user/host choices; native dispatch passes no override.
0083 routes Luna/max to routine work (implementation, tests, fixes, docs,
refactors); Sol/medium to exploration/tracing; Sol/high to planning,
decomposition, difficult diagnosis, independent grills, final functional checks.
Delegated/lite threads lead on Sol/medium; edits go to Luna/max subagents.
Formal review: unchanged external Autoreview
(internals own policy); no lane selects Luna/low. Native transport process-free;
no Forge lifecycle/authorship proof.

## Deterministic Commands

Devs speak intents; the `/forge` skill maps them to these commands.
Lost? `./forge next` prints the current phase and exact next actions.

```bash
python3 factory/scripts/intake.py --issue ENG-123 --title "Feature title"
python3 factory/scripts/record_decomposition_from_json.py --input /tmp/decomposition.json
python3 factory/scripts/update_run.py --phase awaiting-approval --plan-status awaiting-approval
./forge task close <task-id>
./forge outcome set "<what changed and what someone can now do>"
python3 factory/scripts/pr_ready.py
```

## Hard Gates

Task proof lives in `.factory/stories/<key>/tasks/<id>/`:
`verify.json`, `tests.json`, and `reviews/selected.json` with its immutable
selected-generation lineage. Those output files alone are not current authority:
their content-bound stage proof receipts and selected reviewed-meaning identity
must also match; see `docs/QUALITY.md`. Fixed lens files are diagnostic or
migration input only. Plan, `run.json` and
`decomposition.json` stay story-scoped. Review inputs and local/CI/board proof checks follow `docs/specs/dual-coordinator-parity.md`.

A story ships with every task marker and clean proof on trunk. Closeout never
re-verifies. Story proof is only `outcome.json` (`./forge outcome set`).

## Non-Negotiables

- Constitution binds every executor/environment: follow/cite `constitution/README.md`; never re-derive. Approval locks the contract to PR open; later material changes need human authorization: shipped → new task; done/unshipped → `forge task reopen`; active → amend + fresh native approval under `docs/QUALITY.md`; never reshuffle the graph unilaterally.
- Every executor applies Ponytail to code edits: YAGNI → reuse → stdlib → native → installed dep → one line → minimum viable. Preserve validation, error handling, security, accessibility. Brief-inlined; review-enforced; no recording gate.
- Keep tasks bounded and capability-driven; plans bind one roadmap story and attest all active decisions.
- Plan, task-scope and protected-state gates remain armed. Claude uses its
  plugin companion and degraded outage valve; native uses host subagents
