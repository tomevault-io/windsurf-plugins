# Claude Instructions

## Commit messages
- Keep commit messages brief (one short line)
- No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer — omit it entirely
- Detailed context belongs in the pull request description, not the commit

## Pull requests
- PR descriptions should be thorough: what changed, why, how to test
- One branch per issue, named `<type>/issue-<N>-<slug>`

## General
- No comments unless the why is non-obvious
- No trailing summaries in responses — output speaks for itself
