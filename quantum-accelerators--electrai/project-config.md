ElectrAI is a PyTorch based super-resolution machine learning model for materials. Currently, it implements a ResUNet neural network architecture using PyTorch Lightning.

Begin with example training code in examples/MP/run.sh.

Always use uv when running python code and managing its environment.

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync
```

## Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting)
uvx pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/electrai
```

## Training

Please ask if you need to train a model.

## Configuration

Training is controlled via YAML config files in `src/electrai/configs/`. Key parameters:
- `n_channels`, `n_residual_blocks`: Model architecture
- `lr`, `epochs`, `nbatch`: Training hyperparameters
- `warmup_length`: Learning rate warmup epochs
- `wandb_mode`: "online", "offline", or "disabled"

## Data Formats

Supports multiple data sources:
- Native CHGCAR files (via pymatgen) **Currently preferred**
- Compressed JSON (.json.gz)
- Zarr format (local or S3 paths)

Use `zarr_conversion/` utilities to convert between formats.
