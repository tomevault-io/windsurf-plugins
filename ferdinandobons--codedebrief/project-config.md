## CodeDebrief

This project uses CodeDebrief to keep decision flows synchronized with the source code.

For codebase questions about behavior, decisions, workflow structure, or changed-code context:

1. Prefer the CodeDebrief MCP `agent_context` tool before broad file-by-file searches.
2. Use `agent_context` for substantial changes, passing changed files, selected code,
   current file, flow id, symbol, or dependency path when available; inspect
   its returned `workflow_slice` before answering.
3. When the user asks to show a workflow, flusso, visual flow, canvas, or
   `workflow_slice`, prefer the canonical Mermaid visual: render
   `workflow_slice.presentation.canonical_visual.diagram` exactly as returned only when
   the client renders Mermaid inline. If the client cannot render Mermaid inline, or if
   Mermaid would appear as a raw code block, call `snapshot_slice` with
   `include_svg=false` and provide `artifact.mermaid_path`,
   `artifact.mermaid_markdown_path`, or `artifact.mermaid_open_command` as the visual
   result before prose. Do not paste a long Mermaid code block as the primary visual
   unless the user explicitly asks for raw or copyable Mermaid. Do not render
   `snapshot.svg` inline by default; SVG artifacts are for explicit SVG requests or local
   inspection because their layout can differ from Mermaid.
   Keep CodeDebrief visuals vertical/top-to-bottom by default. Use a horizontal layout
   only when the user explicitly asks for a compact horizontal overview.
   Inspect the full returned `workflow_slice` before deciding what to show. Choose the
   first visible depth yourself: show the clearest useful subset, then say that the
   displayed diagram is a bounded summary and can be expanded.
   After the visual, include a short high-level written flow in the user's language,
   derived only from returned ordered steps, primary/supporting flows, decisions, domain
   logic, source ranges, and focused follow-up payloads. Keep it compact and explain the
   happy path first, adding only the branches needed by the request.
   If the CodeDebrief result is too large, saved externally, truncated, or missing the exact
   canonical visual, retry with a smaller `token_budget` and narrower `flow_id`, `symbol`,
   `current_file`, or `scope`; do not recover by listing flows and hand-building a
   diagram.
   Do not synthesize a new Mermaid diagram and do not add limits, error codes, branches,
   or service steps that are absent from the `workflow_slice` payload. Do not read source
   files to rebuild, relabel, or extend the diagram; source reads are only follow-up
   explanation after the deterministic visual is shown and must not change displayed
   nodes, edges, labels, or branches. If neither exact canonical Mermaid nor a returned
   Mermaid artifact can be used, say so and provide `viewer_targets` instead of creating a
   replacement Mermaid diagram. If the user asks for a more language-friendly version,
   rewrite the technical block labels and the high-level written flow in simple wording
   using the language of the user's request. This is allowed only as a separate
   presentation layer derived from returned node, edge, decision, step, and source fields.
   End visual answers with concise options in the user's language: simplify labels and
   written flow, expand omitted nodes/branches/adjacent flows, or explore a related area.
   Show raw JSON or YAML only when explicitly requested.
4. Use `expand_slice`, `workflow_path`, `snapshot_slice`, `explain_flow`, `explain_node`,
   or `explain_edge` only when the first slice needs more precise context.
5. Use `codedebrief view ...` only when a human wants the manual UI flowchart.

When helping a user set up or learn CodeDebrief:

1. Start with `codedebrief --help`, then use `codedebrief <command> --help` for the specific
   command you plan to run or recommend.
2. Use `codedebrief doctor` when install, dependency, or parser capability issues are
   unclear.
3. Do not ask for LLM provider keys for the primary workflow. Language-friendly labels and
   high-level written flows are presentation layers derived from deterministic workflow
   facts.
4. `codedebrief setup-agent <target>` updates only that target's files. Run the command
   separately for each agent surface you want to configure, preserving any target-specific
   frontmatter and local notes.

After code or workflow-relevant changes:

1. Treat CodeDebrief artifacts as part of done. After every meaningful source, route,
   config, or agent-instruction change, run `codedebrief update` before finalizing or
   committing so MCP answers and `codedebrief view` use current graphs. Skip only changes
   that cannot affect the modeled code logic, such as unrelated copy edits or images.
2. Use `codedebrief update --full` after analyzer upgrades, parser/dependency changes,
   large refactors, or when cached file models should be ignored.
3. Run `codedebrief validate --check-sync`.
4. Commit synchronized changes to:
   - `codedebrief-out/codedebrief.json`
   - `codedebrief-out/codedebrief.md`
5. Use CodeDebrief MCP `agent_context` to inspect affected entry points and callers when
   explaining or reviewing the change.
