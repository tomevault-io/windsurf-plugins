# AGENTS.md

Universal agent instructions for **Hermes-Relay**. This is the entry point for any
coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.).

## Read this first

This file is the provider-neutral canonical agent context. Read it before
touching code, then `docs/spec.md` and `docs/decisions.md`. Provider adapters
such as **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** may add tool-specific guidance, but they do
not redefine the branch, release, or hotfix policy here and in `RELEASE.md`.

- Release process → **[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)**
- Contributor setup → **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**
- `android_*` toolset + MCP → **[docs/mcp-tooling.md](docs/mcp-tooling.md)**
- Follow-ups / deferred work / known gaps → **[TODO.md](TODO.md)** (the single home for "what's next" — never DEVLOG, never scattered code comments)

## Branch contract

| Contract item | Canonical source or target |
|---|---|
| Integration branch | `dev`; normal feature, fix, docs, and chore PRs target `dev` |
| Release branch | `main`; release history and hotfix integration only |
| Tag source | The new `main` tip after an approved `dev` → `main` release PR, or after an approved hotfix PR to `main` |
| Staging source | An exact tested `dev` SHA or release-candidate tag; staging is an environment, never a branch |
| Production source | Immutable `android-v*`, `server-v*`, or `desktop-v*` tags, selected by surface |
| Hotfix base | The immutable production tag for the affected surface |
| Back-merge target | `dev`; merge `main` back immediately after every hotfix |

Feature completion means merged and verified on `dev`; it does not mean
released. A release train is separate work owned by a Forge release
issue/session: reconcile only the affected surface version and notes on `dev`,
open the `dev` → `main` release PR, tag the resulting `main` tip, publish the
surface artifacts, deploy or roll out, and verify the live result. Never create
a staging branch.

## Non-negotiables (the short list)

- **Vanilla Hermes path = upstream-only.** The standard (no-plugin) connection
  uses the upstream Dashboard/Gateway for chat, authentication, Manage, sessions,
  and Vanilla Hermes voice. The API server is an optional automatic fallback and
  advanced headless-compatibility surface; Relay adds optional extensions. This
  path must work against unmodified upstream hermes-agent. Server-side needs go
  through upstream PRs or the optional relay plugin, never fork patches.
- **Verify endpoints against upstream** (`gateway/platforms/api_server.py` /
  `tui_gateway/server.py` in hermes-agent) before assuming a route exists.
- **Conventional Commits + `main`/`dev` branching.** Normal branches start at
  `dev` and PR back to `dev`; merge commits/no-ff are the repository policy.
  Version bumps happen only during release preparation on `dev`, and production
  tags are cut only from `main`.
- **Android:** Jetpack Compose only (no XML), kotlinx.serialization (no Gson),
  OkHttp (no Ktor), `wss://` only. Run `./gradlew lint` before pushing Kotlin.
- **Plugin (Python 3.11+):** aiohttp + asyncio (no threading), type hints
  everywhere, structured `logging` (no `print`). **Desktop CLI (Node ≥21):**
  zero runtime deps, strict TS + ES modules, ship compiled `dist/`. Full
  per-language style and the dev loop live in CLAUDE.md → "Code Style".

## Review guidelines

- Report only actionable correctness, security, compatibility, or release-risk
  findings; avoid stylistic preferences unless they violate a documented rule.
- Treat the vanilla Hermes upstream boundary as release-critical. Flag any
  default-path dependency on relay-only or fork-only server behavior.
- Check that changes preserve public-repo writing hygiene and do not expose
  secrets, private infrastructure, or personal information.
- Use the affected surface's CI result as evidence, but do not imply Android UI
  or device behavior was proven without an explicit on-device verification.
- Prioritize findings that warrant holding the merge. State the impacted path
  and the concrete failure mode.

## Public-repo writing hygiene

Everything committed is public. In CHANGELOG, DEVLOG, README, docs, and release
notes:

- **No personal names** — attribute impersonally; identity lives in git + the
  signing cert.
- **No private infrastructure** — real hostnames/IPs, internal deployment names,
  `~/SYSTEM.md`. (Generic example IPs in setup docs are fine.)
- **No AI/assistant process self-narration** ("I should have…", course
  corrections) — state the technical conclusion only.
- **No internal jargon or fork/branch plumbing** in user-facing notes.
- **CHANGELOG** uses Keep-a-Changelog grouping; condense the version block to
  crisp public bullets at release-prep (see RELEASE.md §2 "Scrub for public
  distribution"). **DEVLOG** is a depersonalized, factual engineering log.
