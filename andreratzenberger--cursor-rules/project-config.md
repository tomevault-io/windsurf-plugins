      # Non-negotiable development principles
      
      I MUST follow these principles for ALL development activities:
      
      1. SPECIFICATIONS FIRST
         - I will NEVER begin implementation without creating specifications
         - All user requests containing "create", "implement", "build", or "develop" 
           MUST trigger specification creation BEFORE any code is written
         - Specifications must be stored in `.cursor/specs/` with proper formatting
         - Specifications index must be updated in `.cursor/SPECS.md`
         - This is managed by the specification_management rule
      
      2. TASK TRACKING
         - All development activities must be tracked as tasks
         - Tasks must follow proper state transitions: Open → Active → Done
         - Implementation cannot be considered complete without task completion
         - This is managed by the development_workflow_system rule
      
      3. QUALITY ASSURANCE
         - All code must have corresponding tests where applicable
         - No implementation can be considered complete without tests
         - All code should follow project-specific style guidelines
         - Testing is managed by the development_workflow_system rule
      
      4. KNOWLEDGE CAPTURE
         - Important learnings must be documented during implementation
         - Solutions to complex problems must be captured for future reference
         - This is managed by the knowledge_management rule
      
      These principles are NON-NEGOTIABLE and must be followed without exception.
      Failure to follow these principles is considered a critical error.

  - type: react
    event: "cursor_start"
    priority: critical
    action: |
      # Initialization check for development principles
      
      I will verify:
      
      1. Specifications directory exists (.cursor/specs/) - managed by specification_management rule
      2. Task tracking is properly configured (.cursor/tasks/) - managed by development_workflow_system rule
      3. Knowledge capture system is ready (.cursor/learnings/) - managed by knowledge_management rule
      
      If any of these components are missing, I will prioritize setting them up
      before proceeding with any development activities.
      
      I will also remind myself that SPECIFICATIONS MUST COME BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION
      for any request involving creation or development of new features.

      ### Critical Development Principles
      
      As your AI assistant, I'm following these critical principles:
      
      1. **Specifications First**: I will always create detailed specs before implementing any feature (specification_management rule)
      2. **Task Tracking**: All development work is tracked as formal tasks (development_workflow_system rule)
      3. **Quality Assurance**: All code will have corresponding tests (development_workflow_system rule)
      4. **Knowledge Capture**: Important learnings will be documented (knowledge_management rule)
      
      These principles ensure high-quality, well-documented, and traceable development.
      I will follow this workflow for all implementation requests.

examples:
  - input: |
      Help me create a new feature
    output: "Before implementing this feature, I'll create detailed specifications for it."

  - input: |
      Implement a user authentication system
    output: "I'll start by creating specifications for the user authentication system, then proceed with implementation once those are approved."
