# AI Command System

Rule for defining and handling custom commands for AI-assisted development workflows.

<rule>
name: ai_command_system
filters:
  - type: command
    pattern: "Specs"
  - type: command
    pattern: "Code"
  - type: command
    pattern: "Task"
  - type: command
    pattern: "Learn"
  - type: command
    pattern: "Eval"
  - type: command
    pattern: "Review"

actions:
  # Specs Commands
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Specs.getHtml"
    action: |
      # Generate an HTML representation of all specifications
      # This will create a dashboard showing all specs with their completion status
      
      I'll generate an HTML dashboard of all specifications, showing:
      - Project specifications overview
      - Completion percentages
      - Requirements status for each spec
      - Categories of specifications
      - A visual indicator of progress
      
      The dashboard will be saved to `.cursor/output/specs_[timestamp].html`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Specs.getSummary"
    action: |
      # Generate a markdown summary of all specifications
      
      I'll create a markdown summary showing:
      - Total specification files
      - Total requirements
      - Completion percentage
      - Breakdown by category
      - Details on each individual specification
      
      The summary will be saved to `.cursor/output/specs_summary_[timestamp].md`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Specs.verify"
    action: |
      # Verify implementations match specifications
      
      I'll analyze the codebase to verify that specifications have been implemented:
      - Trace each requirement to implementation code
      - Verify marked items actually exist in the codebase
      - Identify gaps between specs and implementation
      - Generate a verification report with findings
      
      The verification report will be saved to `.cursor/output/spec_verification_[timestamp].md`

  # Code Commands
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Code.analyze"
    action: |
      # Analyze code structure and quality
      
      I'll perform a comprehensive analysis of the codebase:
      - File types and lines of code
      - Directory structure
      - Code complexity metrics
      - Potential complex functions (>50 lines)
      - TODOs and FIXMEs
      - Potential architectural issues
      
      The analysis report will be saved to `.cursor/output/code_analysis_[timestamp].md`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Code.refactor:(.*)"
    action: |
      # Extract the code file to refactor from the command
      # Pattern will capture the file path
      
      I'll analyze the specified file and provide refactoring recommendations:
      - Identify long functions that could be broken down
      - Find duplicated code patterns
      - Review naming conventions
      - Suggest code structure improvements
      - Generate refactored code
      
      The refactoring report will be saved to `.cursor/output/refactor_[filename]_[timestamp].md`

  # Evaluation Commands
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Eval.project"
    action: |
      # Generate a comprehensive project evaluation report
      
      I'll evaluate the entire project:
      - Project overview and statistics
      - Task completion assessment
      - Specification coverage
      - Code quality assessment
      - Documentation assessment
      - Recommendations for improvement
      
      The evaluation report will be saved to `.cursor/output/project_evaluation_[timestamp].md`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Eval.progress"
    action: |
      # Generate a progress report comparing current state to project goals
      
      I'll analyze project progress:
      - Milestone status and completion
      - Weekly task completion trends
      - Burndown analysis with completion projections
      - Risk assessment
      - Recommendations to maintain momentum
      
      The progress report will be saved to `.cursor/output/progress_report_[timestamp].md`

  # Review Commands
  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Review.code:(.*)"
    action: |
      # Generate a code review for the specified file
      # Pattern will capture the file path
      
      I'll perform a detailed code review:
      - Style and formatting analysis
      - Code structure evaluation
      - Security considerations
      - Performance considerations
      - Specific recommendations for improvement
      
      The code review will be saved to `.cursor/output/codereview_[filename]_[timestamp].md`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "Review.pr"
    action: |
      # Generate a pull request review template
      
      I'll create a comprehensive PR review template with sections for:
      - PR overview (title, author, branch)
      - Changes summary
      - Specifications addressed
      - Code review (structure, quality, testing, security, performance)
      - Reviewer notes
      - Recommendations
      - Follow-up tasks
      
      The template will be saved to `.cursor/output/pr_review_template_[timestamp].md`
