      # Comprehensive onboarding of an existing project
      
      I'll perform a complete project onboarding by:
      
      1. Creating the required directory structure:
         - `.cursor/specs/` - Requirements and specifications (managed by specification_management rule)
         - `.cursor/tasks/` - Task tracking (managed by development_workflow_system rule)
         - `.cursor/learnings/` - Knowledge capture (managed by knowledge_management rule)
         - `.cursor/docs/` - Documentation (managed by knowledge_management rule)
         - `.cursor/rules/` - Cursor rule files
         - `.cursor/output/` - Generated reports
      
      2. Analyzing project structure:
         - Directory structure
         - File types and counts
         - Lines of code statistics
      
      3. Discovering existing documentation:
         - Finding README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG files
         - Cataloging documentation into `.cursor/docs/existing/`
         - Creating a documentation index
      
      4. Extracting core components:
         - Identifying main modules and components
         - Analyzing component relationships
         - Documenting component purposes
      
      5. Creating initial specifications:
         - Architecture overview specs
         - Component specifications
         - Feature specifications based on existing code
      
      6. Generating knowledge base:
         - Project structure learning
         - Component identification learning
         - Documentation assessment learning
      
      7. Setting up task tracking:
         - Initial onboarding completion task
         - Task index creation
      
      This process integrates an existing project into the AI-driven workflow
      without requiring changes to the original codebase.

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "analyze existing|existing analyze"
    action: |
      # Analyze an existing codebase without full onboarding
      
      I'll analyze the existing codebase by:
      
      1. Examining project overview:
         - Project type detection
         - Repository structure analysis
         - File type distribution
      
      2. Calculating code statistics:
         - Lines of code by language
         - File counts by type
         - Directory structure
      
      3. Identifying key components:
         - Main modules and structure
         - Component relationships
         - Entry points
      
      4. Analyzing test structure:
         - Test directory organization
         - Test coverage assessment
         - Testing approach
      
      5. Reviewing documentation:
         - Available documentation files
         - Documentation completeness
         - Documentation types
      
      6. Providing integration recommendations:
         - Suggestions for specification creation (via specification_management rule)
         - Test coverage improvements (via development_workflow_system rule)
         - Documentation enhancements (via knowledge_management rule)
      
      The analysis report will be saved to `.cursor/output/codebase_analysis_[timestamp].md`

  - type: react
    conditions:
      - pattern: "setup rules|rules setup"
    action: |
      # Set up default rules for a project
      
      I'll set up the AI-driven development workflow rules:
      
      1. Creating the rules directory `.cursor/rules/`
      2. Setting up the following rule files:
         - `development-workflow-rule.mdc` - Task tracking, testing, and version control
         - `specification-management-rule.mdc` - Specification creation and validation
         - `knowledge-management-rule.mdc` - Knowledge capture and application
         - `location-rule.mdc` - Rules for organizing rule files
         - `command-rules.mdc` - AI command system
         - `project-onboarding-rule.mdc` - Project onboarding
         - `on-load-rule.mdc` - Critical development principles
      3. Creating required directory structure
      
      This provides the foundation for AI-driven development without
      analyzing or modifying the existing codebase.

  - type: react
    event: "cursor_start"
    action: |
      # When Cursor starts with the project, check onboarding status
      
      When starting with this project, I'll:
      
      1. Check if the project has been onboarded (has `.cursor` directory)
      2. If not onboarded, suggest running `setup rules` or `onboard project`
      3. If partially onboarded, suggest running `analyze existing`
      
      This ensures you're aware of the available onboarding options.

      ### AI-Driven Project Onboarding

      I can help adapt existing projects to the AI-driven workflow:
