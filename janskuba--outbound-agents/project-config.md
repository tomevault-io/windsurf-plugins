# Brisbane Agents — B2B Outbound Pipeline

7 AI agents that turn a raw company list into personalized multi-channel outbound sequences.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Input CSV → Signal Scraper (auto-enriches) → [Review] → Lead Prioritizer → Prospect Profiler → Hook Writer → Sequence Builder → Final Sequences
            (0-enriched + 1-signals)                     (2-prioritized)    (3-profiles)        (4-hooks)     (5-sequences)
```

**Standalone agents** (run independently):
- **Reply Classifier** — classify incoming replies and recommend next actions
- **Meeting Prep** — generate pre-call briefs for booked meetings

## How to Run

### Full Pipeline
```
/outbound-pipeline input/my-companies.csv
```

Input can be as simple as a CSV with just company names — the Signal Scraper auto-enriches missing data via web search. After enrichment, you review the data before the pipeline continues.

### Individual Agents
Just ask naturally:
- "Run the signal scraper on input/my-companies.csv"
- "Classify the replies in input/sample-replies.csv"
- "Prep me for the meetings in input/sample-meetings.csv"

## ICP Configuration

Edit `input/icp-config.csv` to customize scoring and copy for your product. The lead prioritizer, hook writer, and sequence builder all read this file. Without it, agents run in generic mode.

## Agent Roles

| # | Agent | What It Does |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Signal Scraper | Auto-enriches sparse CSVs via web search, then detects buying signals |
| 2 | Lead Prioritizer | Scores leads 1-100, assigns TIER_1 through TIER_4 (uses ICP config if present) |
| 3 | Prospect Profiler | Builds 60-second actionable profiles for reps |
| 4 | Hook Writer | Crafts personalized opening lines (max 120 chars, uses ICP config if present) |
| 5 | Sequence Builder | Creates 7-touch, 21-day multi-channel sequences (uses ICP config if present) |
| 6 | Reply Classifier | Classifies replies into 7 categories with next actions |
| 7 | Meeting Prep | Generates pre-call briefs with time-blocked agendas |

## File Conventions

- Pipeline output files use numbered prefixes: `output/0-enriched.csv`, `output/1-signals.csv`, etc.
- Standalone agents write to `output/classified-replies.csv` and `output/meeting-briefs.csv`
- Input files go in `input/`
- Example output from a test run is in `examples/`

## Required Input Columns (Pipeline)

Only `company_name` is required. All other columns are optional — the Signal Scraper will research missing data via web search.
