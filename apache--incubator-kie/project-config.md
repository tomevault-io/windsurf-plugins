# Conventions

## Code style

- Configure your IDE with the shared formatter and import order files from
  [`kogito-build/kogito-ide-config/src/main/resources/`](../kogito-build/kogito-ide-config/src/main/resources/):
  - **Eclipse**: import `eclipse-format.xml` under *Preferences > Java > Code
    Style > Formatter*, and `eclipse.importorder` under *Organize Imports*.
  - **IntelliJ IDEA**: install the *Eclipse Code Formatter* plugin, point it at
    `eclipse-format.xml`, enable *Optimize Imports*, and use
    `eclipse.importorder`.
  - **VS Code**: install the *Checkstyle for Java* extension and set
    `eclipse-format.xml` as the Checkstyle configuration file.
- No `@author` tags in Javadoc — Git history tracks authorship.
- Prefer readability over conciseness: self-explanatory method names,
  meaningful variable names, small classes with a single clear responsibility,
  and methods that don't depend on hidden state established by their callers.

## Licensing

- Every source file carries the ASF license header. This is enforced in CI
  (`ci_check_license_headers` workflow). To format headers automatically:

  ```bash
  mvn com.mycila:license-maven-plugin:format
  ```

- Dependency licensing rules (Apache-2.0-compatible only, available on Maven
  Central, no fat/shaded jars, sources public, …) are spelled out in
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#requirements-for-dependencies).

## Service discovery (SPI)

Two discovery mechanisms are used across the codebase:

- **Standard Java SPI** (`src/main/resources/META-INF/services/`) — used by
  Efesto plugins (`KieCompilerService`, `KieRuntimeService`) and the PMML
  engine.
- **KIE service discovery** (`META-INF/kie.conf`) — the traditional Drools
  mechanism; e.g. `drools-mvel` registers its implementations there, and
  missing implementations are reported centrally by
  `org.drools.core.base.CoreComponentsBuilder`.

## Code generation

Code generation is used by several engines (Drools executable model, Kogito
codegen, PMML). Shared principles:

- **Generate the code you would write by hand** if there were no codegen step —
  and before opening a PR, read the generated code and check that it does.
- Generation is JavaParser-based and template-driven; prefer manipulating the
  AST over plain string replacement. Template files use the `.tmpl` extension
  (PMML) or live under `src/main/resources/class-templates/` named
  `<Something><Runtime>Template.java` with `$…$` placeholders (Kogito).
- Prefer framework-specific templates plus shared plain classes over
  framework-agnostic templates patched by annotators. A template with no
  placeholders should be promoted to a plain shared class.
- In generated DI code, favor constructor injection; REST endpoints are the
  exception (field injection, no inheritance).

## Testing

- Integration test classes are named `*IT.java` (failsafe); everything else is
  a unit test (surefire). See [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md) for the flags and
  Quarkus-specific annotations.
- Include tests with every PR — existing unit tests are treated as the
  compatibility contract when refactoring.
- After significant refactoring of an engine, run the corresponding benchmarks
  in [incubator-kie-benchmarks](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-benchmarks)
  to catch performance regressions.

## Documentation

- Architecture and design diagrams are authored as PlantUML `.puml` files.
- Reference documentation for end users belongs to the
  [Apache KIE website](https://kie.apache.org/docs/documentation/), not this
  repository. Documentation about how *this repository* works belongs in
  [docs/](./README.md).
