# Working in this repository

When verifying changes in this repository, take advantage of the `make dev`
script to perform partial builds:

```bash
make dev
```

It works out which modules your changes touch, rebuilds any upstream modules that
are missing or out of date, and builds the rest.

| Command | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `make dev` | You changed code and want to check it still builds |
| `make dev scope` | You want to see what would be built, without building |
| `make dev config` | You want to see the current settings |
| `make dev mvn -- <mvn args>` | You need a specific Maven command, e.g. to run tests |

Never commit `.kie-dev/` — it is local state, and gitignored.

## Everything else

**[docs/README.md](./docs/README.md)** is the index: how this repository is
structured, how to build it, its conventions, and what CI checks on a pull
request.

The two that come up most often are [docs/DEV.md](./docs/DEV.md), which covers
how `make dev` decides what to build and every setting it takes, and
[docs/BUILDING.md](./docs/BUILDING.md) for full builds.

If you change the scripts behind `make dev` or the CI scripts, run their tests
first — see [script/dev/README.md](./script/dev/README.md) and
[script/ci/README.md](./script/ci/README.md).
