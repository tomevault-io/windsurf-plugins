# Shell Script Standards

## No emoji in echo/printf output

```bash
# BAD
echo "🚀 Starting build..."
echo "✅ Build complete"
echo "❌ Build failed"

# GOOD
echo "Starting build..."
echo "Build complete"
echo "Build failed"
```

## No over-decorated output

Keep script output informative and scannable. Avoid ASCII art banners, box-drawing characters around status messages, or multi-line success celebrations.

## Error handling over decoration

Spend effort on `set -euo pipefail`, proper error messages with context, and cleanup traps — not on making echo output colorful.
