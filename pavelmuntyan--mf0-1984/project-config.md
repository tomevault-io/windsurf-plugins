# Version, GitHub, and PM2 (`mf-lab`)

## New version → GitHub

When the user **declares a new project version** (release, pin version, push to GitHub, etc.) — **immediately** run the full flow from **`mf0-github-backup.mdc`**: `git add`, commit with version from `package.json` (or as the user said), `git push` to `origin` / `main`, remote `git@github.com:PavelMuntyan/MF0-1984.git`.

## After edits in the project → PM2

When the agent **wrote changes** to `mf-lab` repo files in response to the user:

1. **At the end** of handling the request (before the final reply), if there were substantive code changes — from project root run **`pm2 restart mf-lab-api mf-lab-vite`** (same as **`npm run pm2:restart`**).
2. If `pm2` is unavailable or processes are missing — for the API follow **`mf-lab-restart-api.mdc`** (`mf-lab-api` / default port 35184).
3. If **no project files** changed for the request (read-only, advice only) — do not restart PM2.

Do not only say “restart yourself” when the terminal is available.

## Limits

- Do not use restart and the API for **destructive tests** on live `data/*.sqlite` — see **`no-destructive-db-in-agent-tests.mdc`**.
