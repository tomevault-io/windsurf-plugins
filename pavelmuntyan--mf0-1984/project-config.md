# Database during an agent session

- **Do not** run `DELETE` / `UPDATE` / `INSERT` on `data/mf-lab.sqlite` (or equivalents) for “testing” without an explicit user request.
- For HTTP API checks use a **separate DB file** (`API_SQLITE_PATH` / file copy) or a **temporary port** and a **test** database the user does not rely on as primary.
- Do not run `curl` / theme-delete scripts against the real `data/*.sqlite` in the user's workspace.
