# Tech stack documentation

Canonical reference: [`docs/TECH_STACK.md`](../../docs/TECH_STACK.md)

When adding or changing stack-related items, update that file in the same change:

- New or removed **npm dependencies** (especially runtime deps)
- **Supabase** migrations, Edge Functions, secrets, or env vars
- **EAS** build profiles, Expo plugins, or native modules
- **External services** (OpenAI, Google Places, RevenueCat, Sentry, etc.)
- **Build / CI / deploy** tooling

Add a row to the **Changelog** section with the date and a one-line summary.
