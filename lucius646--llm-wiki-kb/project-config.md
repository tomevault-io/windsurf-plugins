# Karpathy LLM Wiki

Build and maintain a personal knowledge base using LLMs. You manage two directories: `raw/` (immutable source material) and `wiki/` (compiled knowledge articles). Sources go into raw/, you compile them into wiki articles, and the wiki compounds over time.

Core ideas from Karpathy:
- "The LLM writes and maintains the wiki; the human reads and asks questions."
- "The wiki is a persistent, compounding artifact."

## Architecture

Three layers, all under the user's project root:

**raw/** — Immutable source material. You read, never modify. Organized by topic subdirectories (e.g., `raw/machine-learning/`).

**wiki/** — Compiled knowledge articles. You have full ownership. Organized by topic subdirectories, one level only: `wiki/<topic>/<article>.md`. Contains two special files:
- `wiki/index.md` — Global index. One row per article, grouped by topic, with link + summary + Updated date.
- `wiki/log.md` — Append-only operation log.

**SKILL.md** (this file) — Schema layer. Defines structure and workflow rules.

Templates live in `references/` relative to this file. Read them when you need the exact format for raw files, articles, archive pages, or the index.

### Initialization

Triggers only on the first Ingest. Check whether `raw/` and `wiki/` exist. Create only what is missing; never overwrite existing files:

- `raw/` directory (with `.gitkeep`)
- `wiki/` directory (with `.gitkeep`)
- `wiki/index.md` — heading `# Knowledge Base Index`, empty body
- `wiki/log.md` — heading `# Wiki Log`, empty body

If Query or Lint cannot find the wiki structure, tell the user: "Run an ingest first to initialize the wiki." Do not auto-create.

## Ingest

Fetch a source into raw/, then compile it into wiki/. Always both steps, no exceptions.

### Fetch (raw/)

1. Get the source content using whatever web or file tools your environment provides. If nothing can reach the source, ask the user to paste it directly.

2. Pick a topic directory. Check existing `raw/` subdirectories first; reuse one if the topic is close enough. Create a new subdirectory only for genuinely distinct topics.

3. Save as `raw/<topic>/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`.
   - Slug from source title, kebab-case, max 60 characters.
   - Published date unknown → omit the date prefix from the file name (e.g., `descriptive-slug.md`). The metadata Published field still appears; set it to `Unknown`.
   - If a file with the same name already exists, append a numeric suffix (e.g., `descriptive-slug-2.md`).
   - Include metadata header: source URL, collected date, published date.
   - Preserve original text. Clean formatting noise. Do not rewrite opinions.

   See `references/raw-template.md` for the exact format.

### Compile (wiki/)

Determine where the new content belongs:

- **Same core thesis as existing article** → Merge into that article. Add the new source to Sources/Raw. Update affected sections.
- **New concept** → Create a new article in the most relevant topic directory. Name the file after the concept, not the raw file.
- **Spans multiple topics** → Place in the most relevant directory. Add See Also cross-references to related articles elsewhere.

These are not mutually exclusive. A single source may warrant merging into one article while also creating a separate article for a distinct concept it introduces. In all cases, check for factual conflicts: if the new source contradicts existing content, annotate the disagreement with source attribution. When merging, note the conflict within the merged article. When the conflicting content lives in separate articles, note it in both and cross-link them.

See `references/article-template.md` for article format. Key points:
- Sources field: author, organization, or publication name + date, semicolon-separated.
- Raw field: markdown links to raw/ files, semicolon-separated.
- Relative paths from `wiki/<topic>/` use `../../raw/<topic>/<file>.md` (two levels up to project root).

### Cascade Updates

After the primary article, check for ripple effects:

1. Scan articles in the same topic directory for content affected by the new source.
2. Scan `wiki/index.md` entries in other topics for articles covering related concepts.
3. Update every article whose content is materially affected. Each updated file gets its Updated date refreshed.

Archive pages are never cascade-updated (they are point-in-time snapshots).

### Post-Ingest

Update `wiki/index.md`: add or update entries for every touched article. When adding a new topic section, include a one-line description. The Updated date reflects when the article's knowledge content last changed, not the file system timestamp. See `references/index-template.md` for format.

Append to `wiki/log.md`:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <primary article title>
- Updated: <cascade-updated article title>
- Updated: <another cascade-updated article title>
```

Omit `- Updated:` lines when no cascade updates occur.

## Query

Search the wiki and answer questions. Examples of triggers:
- "What do I know about X?"
- "Summarize everything related to Y"
