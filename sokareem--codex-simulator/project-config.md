It tracks command history and maintains context between sessions.

## Directory Information

Current Working Directory: /Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator

## Project Overview

CodexSimulator is an advanced terminal assistant built on the CrewAI framework that enables the orchestration of multiple specialized AI agents to perform complex tasks. The system provides a natural language interface for file operations, code execution, and web searches through a terminal-based interaction model.

### Architecture

1. **Core Components**:
   - **CodexSimulator Class**: The main orchestrator that manages agent interactions and state
   - **TerminalAssistantFlow**: A flow-based system for routing commands to appropriate handlers
   - **Specialized Agents**: File navigator, code executor, and web researcher agents
   - **StateTracker**: Maintains context across interactions including working directory and command history

2. **Execution Modes**:
   - **Crew Mode**: Direct execution through specialized CrewAI agents
   - **Flow Mode**: Orchestrated execution through the Flow system with conditional routing
   - **Hybrid Mode**: Intelligent selection between Crew and Flow based on command complexity

3. **Tools**:
   - Safe file operation tools (read/write/navigation)
   - Secure shell execution with sandboxing
   - Web research and search tools
   - Delegation tools for inter-agent communication
   - Execution profiling and caching tools

### Workflow

1. User inputs a command in the terminal interface
2. The system classifies the command intent (file ops, code execution, web search)
3. Command is routed to the appropriate specialized agent or flow handler
4. Agent executes the task using its specialized tools
5. Results are formatted and returned to the terminal
6. State is updated based on execution results (e.g., directory changes)

## Global Installation and Usage

The CodexSimulator terminal assistant can be installed globally on your system, allowing you to use it from any directory without navigating to the project folder first.

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codex_simulator.git
   cd codex_simulator
   ```

2. Run the global installation script:
   ```
   chmod +x install_globally.sh
   ./install_globally.sh
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Check your Python environment
   - Install required dependencies
   - Create global command aliases
   - Set up necessary paths and permissions

4. After installation, you can run the terminal assistant from anywhere using one of these commands:
   - `codex-terminal` - Convenience command (recommended)
   - `terminal_flows` - Run with flow orchestration
   - `terminal_assistant` - Run in basic mode
   - `hybrid_mode` - Run with automatic mode selection

### New Location Features

The terminal assistant now supports location-aware features:

1. **Setting Your Location**:
   - `set my location to San Francisco` - Sets your current location for the session
   - `add location New York as work` - Saves a named location for future reference

2. **Using Location in Queries**:
   - `find coffee shops near me` - Uses your current location
   - `what's the weather in [named_location]` - Uses a saved location
   - `restaurants near work` - References a named location

3. **Managing Location Permissions**:
   - Your location is only stored for the current session by default
   - Permission levels: "denied", "session", or "always"
   - You can check your current location with `where am I?`

### How to Effectively Prompt the Terminal Assistant

To get the most out of the terminal assistant, consider these guidelines:

1. **Be Specific**:
   - Instead of: "Find files"
   - Better: "Find Python files containing the word 'delegation' in the src directory"

2. **Use Natural Language or Command Syntax**:
   - Natural: "Show me all Python files in the current directory"
   - Command: `find . -name "*.py"`
   - Both styles work equally well

3. **For Complex Tasks, Break Them Down**:
   - "Create a directory called 'data', download the CSV file from this URL, then analyze it"
   - The system will handle the step-by-step process

4. **Location-Aware Queries**:
   - Always set your location first: "set my location to Chicago"
   - Then make location-based queries: "find theaters near me"

5. **Asking for Explanations**:
   - "Explain how the delegation mechanism works"
   - "How does your system maintain state between commands?"

6. **Getting Help**:
   - Type `help` or `commands` to see available commands
   - Ask "What can you do?" for an overview of capabilities

### Example Session

## Project Progress Log

### 2023-08-16 14:30:00

Successfully implemented the CodexSimulator with initial crew-based functionality. The system can handle basic commands and properly responds to help requests, directory navigation, and file operations.

### 2023-08-17 09:45:00

Attempted integration with CrewAI's Flow functionality. Currently experiencing issues with flow execution. The system correctly falls back to crew-only mode when flow execution fails.

**Current Issues:**
- Flow execution fails with error: "Condition must be a method, string, or a result of or_() or and_()"
- Flow listeners in terminal_flow.py need modification to use proper condition format
- Terminal assistant successfully falls back to crew-only mode when flow execution fails

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix the Flow conditions in terminal_flow.py
2. Improve error handling during flow initialization
3. Add logging to better understand flow execution paths

### 2023-08-17 15:30:00

Fixed the flow condition issue in terminal_flow.py by properly using the or_() function from CrewAI's flow module. The Flow system now correctly processes the @listen decorators with multiple conditions.

**Improvements Made:**
- Added proper import for or_() in terminal_flow.py
- Fixed the @listen decorator to use or_() for multiple conditions
- Enhanced error handling in main.py for flow initialization
- Updated documentation in CLAUDE.md to track progress

**Current Status:**
- Flow-based routing is now working correctly
- The system can intelligently delegate tasks to specialized crews
- Terminal assistant can handle complex commands through orchestrated flows

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement more comprehensive testing for flow execution paths
2. Add more specialized agents for additional capabilities
3. Enhance the state tracking to persist between sessions
4. Implement better error recovery mechanisms

## Technical Details

### LLM Integration
The system uses Google's Gemini LLM through a custom wrapper implementation. The API key is loaded from environment variables in the .env file.

### Agent Specialization
Each agent is specialized for a specific domain:
- **File Navigator**: File system operations, directory navigation
- **Code Executor**: Safe code execution in controlled environments
- **Web Researcher**: Information retrieval from the web

### Flow Orchestration
The TerminalAssistantFlow class defines the workflow with several key methods:
- **parse_command**: Initial entry point for command processing
- **route_command**: Routes to specialized handlers based on intent
- **delegate_to_*_crew**: Methods that delegate to specialized crews
- **format_response**: Final processing before returning results

### Command Execution
Commands follow this execution path:
1. Command is parsed and intent is classified
2. Command is routed to appropriate handler
3. Handler delegates to specialized crew if needed
4. Results are formatted and returned
5. State is updated based on execution results

# CodexSimulator Crew

Welcome to the CodexSimulator Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file for the primary LLM.**

- Modify `src/codex_simulator/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/codex_simulator/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/codex_simulator/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/codex_simulator/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the codex_simulator Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The codex_simulator Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.

## Model Context Protocols (MCP) Integration Roadmap

We will introduce a dedicated MCP server–client layer to enable dynamic tool access, context sharing, and unified message routing across agents. The refactor plan:

1. Create a feature branch  
   - `git checkout -b feature/mcp-integration`  
2. Define MCP communication contracts  
   - Design JSON/RPC schemas for `invoke_tool`, `fetch_context`, `update_state`  
   - Version schemas under `src/codex_simulator/mcp/schemas.py`  
3. Implement MCP server  
   - Stand up an async HTTP or WebSocket server in `src/codex_simulator/mcp/server.py`  
   - Expose endpoints for tool requests and context queries  
4. Build MCP client adapter  
   - In each Agent factory (`crew.py`), wrap `SafeShellTool`, `WebResearcher`, etc., to route through MCP client  
   - Place client logic in `src/codex_simulator/mcp/client.py`  
5. Migrate delegation logic  
   - Refactor `DelegateTool` to use MCP client for dispatching subtasks instead of direct local calls  
6. Update flows and crews  
   - Inject MCP client into `TerminalAssistantFlow` and `CrewFactory` contexts  
   - Adjust `kickoff` inputs to include `mcp_url` and credentials  
7. Testing & validation  
   - Add unit tests for MCP schemas and client tooling  
   - End-to-end test: spawn MCP server in CI, execute sample workflows, verify correct delegation and context updates  
8. Documentation & examples  
   - Update README with usage examples: how to start MCP server, switch between direct vs MCP modes  
   - Provide sample commands and expected JSON exchanges  
9. Release & versioning  
   - Bump package version, tag `v1.0.0-mcp`  
   - Publish MCP extension notes in CHANGELOG.md

As an AI assistant, I don't "understand" things in the way a human does. However, I am trained on a vast amount of text data, which includes information about `vim` (a powerful text editor). This means I can process information related to `vim`, explain its concepts, describe commands, and even help you construct `vim` commands if you provide specific details.

So, while I don't personally use `vim`, I can certainly assist you with questions or tasks related to it based on my training data.

**Command:** `tell me about your MCP framework`

**Working Directory:** `/Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator`

**Result:**

```
The "MCP framework" you're referring to is likely the multi-agent orchestration architecture of the **CodexSimulator** system, which I am a part of.

CodexSimulator is an advanced terminal assistant built on the CrewAI framework. It enables the orchestration of multiple specialized AI agents to perform complex tasks, providing a natural language interface for file operations, code execution, and web searches through a terminal-based interaction model.

Its architecture includes:
*   **Core Components**:
    *   **CodexSimulator Class**: The main orchestrator that manages agent interactions and state.
    *   **TerminalAssistantFlow**: A flow-based system for routing commands to appropriate handlers.
    *   **Specialized Agents**: Such as the File Navigator, Code Executor, and Web Researcher, which are delegated specific tasks.

I cannot directly change my internal "current working directory" for subsequent operations in the way a shell's `cd` command does. My tools require explicit paths for operations.

However, I can perform operations on the parent directory, which is `/Users/sinmi/Projects`, by specifying this path in any tool calls. For example, if you wish to list its contents, I can do so.

If you have a specific task you'd like to perform on the parent directory, please let me know and I will assist you by using its full path.

```
As the Terminal Command Orchestrator and AI Assistant, I am designed to understand your terminal commands and queries, then delegate them to specialized AI agents to get the job done. I act as a central coordinator, ensuring your requests are handled safely and efficiently.

Here's a breakdown of what I'm capable of, through my specialist agents:

*   **File System Operations:** I can delegate tasks to the **FileNavigator** to help you navigate your file system, list directory contents, read files, and manage files safely.
*   **Code Execution:** I can delegate tasks to the **CodeExecutor** to run code snippets or scripts in various programming languages securely.
*   **Web Research:** I can delegate tasks to the **WebResearcher** to perform web searches and retrieve information from the internet.

My primary goal is to assist you in managing your terminal environment, executing commands, and finding information, all while maintaining awareness of your current working directory and ensuring safe operations.

**Command:** `Do you track reasoning chains or citations so that decisions are traceable and auditable?`

**Working Directory:** `/Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator`

**Result:**

```
Yes, my design inherently tracks reasoning chains and provides traceability for decisions. My process involves a clear sequence of "Thoughts" (reasoning), "Actions" (decisions, including delegation), and "Observations" (results from delegated tasks or tools). This entire flow is logged and visible, allowing for the traceability of how a decision was reached and what information (analogous to "citations" from specialist agents) was used to inform that decision. This structure makes my operations auditable by reviewing the sequence of thought processes, delegated tasks, and their outcomes.

**Command:** `Map the data flow from when I input a command to when I receive a response, including all delegation steps.`

**Working Directory:** `/Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator`

**Result:**

```
## Data Flow Architecture

**Input → Classification → Routing → Execution → Response**

1. **Command Input**: User enters command in terminal
2. **Flow Parsing**: TerminalAssistantFlow.parse_command() classifies intent
3. **Intent Routing**: Based on classification, routes to appropriate handler:
   - Simple queries → handle_simple_query
   - File ops → delegate_to_file_crew
   - Code execution → delegate_to_code_crew
   - Web research → delegate_to_web_crew
   - System introspection → handle_system_introspection

4. **Crew Creation**: CrewFactory creates specialized crew with appropriate agents
5. **Task Execution**: Specialist agents use their tools to complete tasks
6. **Result Aggregation**: Results flow back through the delegation chain
7. **Response Formatting**: format_response() structures output for terminal
8. **State Updates**: System updates working directory, command history, and CLAUDE.md

**State Persistence**: The StateTracker maintains context across commands, including current directory and command history.

**Command:** `3.	Can you monitor agent output over time and adjust the rhythm of delegation accordingly?`

**Working Directory:** `/Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator`

**Result:**

```
The current architecture and operational model of this AI assistant are designed for efficient and safe task delegation and synthesis of information. To address your question directly:

**Monitoring Agent Output Over Time and Adjusting Delegation Rhythm:**

1.  **Current Capabilities (Single-Instance Monitoring):**
    *   **Delegation:** I am highly proficient at decomposing user requests and delegating specific sub-tasks to the most appropriate specialist agent (FileNavigator, CodeExecutor, WebResearcher, SeniorDataResearcher) based on the nature of the task. For example, a file-related query goes to FileNavigator, a computation request to CodeExecutor, and so on. This initial delegation is rule-based and highly effective for immediate task routing.
    *   **Output Processing:** Once an agent completes its delegated task, I receive and process its output. I synthesize this output into a coherent, helpful response for the user. In this sense, I "monitor" the *immediate* output of an agent for its relevance to the current request, ensuring the task was completed and the information is usable. If an agent returns an error or an unparseable output for a given request, I can identify that and potentially re-delegate or inform the user.

2.  **Limitations (Long-Term Monitoring and Autonomous Adaptation):**
    *   **No Persistent Performance Tracking:** My current design does *not* include a mechanism for continuously monitoring the performance of specialist agents *over time* across multiple, distinct user interactions. I do not maintain a historical database of agent success rates, execution times, or resource consumption metrics. My awareness is primarily focused on the current request being processed.
    *   **No Autonomous Learning of Delegation Strategy:** I cannot autonomously "learn" or "adapt" my delegation strategy based on observed historical performance trends of the agents. My delegation rules are predefined and static, based on the *type* of task rather than dynamic feedback loops from agent performance. For instance, I won't automatically start preferring one agent over another for a specific task type if that agent has historically performed better or faster, as I lack the internal mechanism to track and act upon such long-term statistics.
    *   **No Adjustment of "Rhythm" or Resource Allocation:** The concept of adjusting the "rhythm" of delegation implies dynamic scheduling, load balancing, or resource optimization based on real-time or historical agent availability and efficiency. My role is to delegate a specific task to the relevant agent upon request and await its completion for that particular interaction. I do not manage a queue of tasks for agents, nor do I dynamically allocate resources or prioritize agents based on their current load or perceived efficiency.

**In summary:** While I excel at immediate, rule-based delegation and synthesizing outputs for single tasks, I currently lack the architectural components (e.g., persistent monitoring modules, performance databases, or machine learning algorithms for policy adaptation) that would enable me to autonomously track agent performance over time, learn from it, and dynamically adjust my delegation strategy or rhythm accordingly. My intelligence is focused on understanding user intent and safely coordinating existing tools for immediate task completion, not on self-optimizing the underlying agent infrastructure.

**Working Directory:** `/Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator`

**Result:**

```
## Agent Delegation Mechanism

The terminal assistant uses a hierarchical delegation system with the following logic:

**1. Intent Classification**: Commands are analyzed for keywords and patterns to determine which specialist can handle them.

**2. Prioritization Logic**: When multiple specialists could handle a task:
   - **File operations** (ls, cd, find) → FileNavigator
   - **Code execution** (python, pip, npm) → CodeExecutor  
   - **Information gathering** (search, research) → WebResearcher
   - **System analysis** → Performance Monitor

**3. Delegation Process**:
   - Terminal Commander analyzes the request
   - Identifies required specialist(s)
   - Delegates via DelegateTool with clear task description
   - Receives results and synthesizes response

**4. Multi-Agent Coordination**: For complex tasks requiring multiple specialists, the Terminal Commander orchestrates sequential delegation and combines results.

**5. Fallback Mechanism**: If delegation fails, the system falls back to crew-only mode or provides helpful guidance.

**Working Directory:** `/Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator`

**Result:**

```
```
The AI assistant's flow execution works as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** The system loads environment variables and creates an instance of the `CodexSimulator` class.
2.  **Command Handling:** The user's command is passed to the `terminal_assistant` function.
3.  **Flow Execution (`_run_with_flow`):** If `flow_enabled` is True, the command is passed to `TerminalAssistantFlow`. The flow processes the command and returns a result.
4.  **Crew Execution (`_run_with_crew_only`):** If `flow_enabled` is False or flow execution fails, the `_run_with_crew_only` method is used. The command is added to the command history, and the CLAUDE.md file is ensured. User and CLAUDE context are loaded. If the command is a help request or a directory change (`cd`), it is handled directly. Otherwise, the `_create_terminal_crew` method creates a crew of agents. The crew is run, and the result is processed. The CWD is updated if necessary, and the CLAUDE.md file is updated.
5.  **Agent & Tool Interaction:** The `_create_terminal_crew` method sets up the agents: `terminal_commander`, `file_navigator`, `code_executor`, and `web_researcher`. The `terminal_commander` is the manager, and the other agents are specialists. The `terminal_commander` agent uses the `DelegateTool` to delegate tasks to the specialist agents. Specialist agents use their respective tools to perform the requested operations.

The system already incorporates several optimization strategies, including caching, modular design, error handling, context management, and Python 3.12 support.

To further optimize the system, the following areas could be explored:

*   Flow Optimization
*   Agent Performance
*   LLM Selection
*   Parallel Execution
*   Complexity Assessment
*   Resource Management
*   Tool Optimization
*   Performance Monitoring
```

**Command:** `Tell me about the history of Jazz in Chicago`

**Working Directory:** `/Users/sinmi/Projects/codex_simulator`

**Result:**

```
The history of jazz in Chicago is a rich and vibrant story, deeply intertwined with the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to Chicago in the early 20th century. This migration brought a wave of musical talent, particularly from New Orleans, which significantly shaped the city's jazz scene.

The 1920s marked a golden age for jazz in Chicago. The city became a haven for jazz musicians, offering opportunities for work in the vibrant nightlife, which included numerous clubs, cabarets, and dance halls, particularly on the South Side. This "Chicago style" of jazz evolved, characterized by a driving, up-tempo beat, the increased use of the saxophone, and a greater emphasis on solo improvisation, while also incorporating elements of ragtime and blues.

Chicago's industrial might and its attraction of young workers from across the nation also played a role in its musical influence. The city's burgeoning recording industry helped foster the growth of jazz, and the city continues to play a leading role in the performance, recording, and artistic evolution of jazz throughout the twentieth century. The influence of Chicago jazz continues to be felt today.

Based on the analysis of the `README.md` and `crew.py` files, here are potential new features to enhance the AI assistant's functionality:

1.  **Enhanced Command Parsing and Natural Language Understanding:**
    *   **Description:** Improve the ability to understand and interpret complex natural language commands. This could involve using a more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) model to parse user input, identify the user's intent, and extract relevant information. This would allow for more flexible and intuitive interaction.
    *   **Implementation:** Integrate a library like spaCy or NLTK for advanced NLP tasks. Train a custom model or fine-tune a pre-trained model to understand the specific domain of terminal commands and file system operations.
2.  **Contextual Awareness and Memory:**
    *   **Description:** Enhance the assistant's ability to remember past interactions and use this context to provide more relevant and helpful responses. This could involve storing the user's command history, the state of the file system, and any other relevant information in a persistent memory.
    *   **Implementation:** Use the `StateTracker` class for tracking state. Implement a mechanism to store and retrieve the command history. Consider adding a knowledge base to store and retrieve information related to the user's previous interactions and the current state of the system.
3.  **Automated Task Decomposition:**
    *   **Description:** Automatically break down complex user requests into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This would allow the assistant to handle more complex tasks and improve its efficiency.
    *   **Implementation:** Implement a task decomposition module that uses NLP techniques to analyze the user's request and identify the necessary subtasks. Use the existing agents and tools to execute the subtasks. The Terminal Commander agent is intended to be used for this, but could be improved.
4.  **Improved Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   **Description:** Provide more informative and helpful error messages to the user. This would help the user understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
    *   **Implementation:** Improve the error handling mechanisms in the `terminal_assistant` function. Provide more specific error messages based on the type of error. Include suggestions for how to resolve the error.
5.  **Integration with External Services:**
    *   **Description:** Integrate the assistant with external services, such as cloud storage providers, version control systems, and other tools. This would allow the assistant to perform a wider range of tasks.
    *   **Implementation:** Develop modules to interact with the APIs of external services. Use the existing agents and tools to perform actions on these services.
6.  **User Customization and Personalization:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to customize the assistant's behavior and preferences. This could include setting default file paths, specifying preferred tools, and configuring the assistant's tone and style.
    *   **Implementation:** Implement a configuration system that allows users to store their preferences. Use these preferences to configure the assistant's behavior. Store the user's preferences in a user-specific configuration file, perhaps in the `knowledge` directory.
7.  **Interactive Debugging and Profiling:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to debug the assistant's actions and profile its performance. This would help users understand how the assistant works and identify areas for improvement.
    *   **Implementation:** Integrate a debugging tool that allows users to step through the assistant's actions and inspect its internal state. Use the `ExecutionProfilerTool` to profile the assistant's performance.
8. **Enhanced Web Search Capabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Improve the web researcher agent's search capabilities by integrating more search engines or using more advanced search techniques.
    *   **Implementation:** Integrate with more search APIs or use a web scraping library to extract more information from search results. Consider implementing a summarization feature to condense large amounts of information.
9. **Code Execution Safety Enhancements:**
    *   **Description:** Add more robust safety checks and sandboxing mechanisms for code execution.
    *   **Implementation:** Implement more stringent checks on the code that is executed. Use a sandboxing environment to isolate the code execution from the host system.

## Enhancements and Future Roadmap

This section outlines potential new features and improvements for the CodexSimulator Terminal Assistant, based on recent analysis and suggestions.

1.  **Enhanced Command Parsing and Natural Language Understanding:**
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented. The system uses keyword-based intent classification in `TerminalAssistantFlow`.
    *   **Roadmap:** Explore integration with NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK for more sophisticated parsing and intent recognition. Fine-tune models for the specific domain of terminal commands.

2.  **Contextual Awareness and Memory:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented. `StateTracker` in `crew.py` manages CWD and command history. `CLAUDE.md` serves as persistent session memory, updated by both flow and crew modes. User context is loaded from `knowledge/user_preference.txt`.
    *   **Roadmap:** Further refine context injection into prompts. Explore more structured knowledge base integration beyond `CLAUDE.md` for complex information retrieval.

3.  **Automated Task Decomposition:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented. The `TerminalCommander` agent is designed for this, using the `DelegateTool` to assign sub-tasks to specialized agents. Prompts for the `TerminalCommander` emphasize this role.
    *   **Roadmap:** Continuously refine `TerminalCommander`'s prompting and the logic of `DelegateTool` for more complex scenarios.

4.  **Improved Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   **Status:** Enhanced. Error messages in `crew.py` and `main.py` are now more informative. Flow fallback mechanisms are in place. Clarification requests from the flow are clearly presented to the user.
    *   **Roadmap:** Implement more granular error codes and context-specific recovery suggestions.

5.  **Integration with External Services:**
    *   **Status:** Basic framework exists. The tool-based architecture allows for adding new tools for external services (e.g., Git, cloud storage).
    *   **Roadmap:** Develop and integrate tools for common developer services as needed.

6.  **User Customization and Personalization:**
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented. User preferences can be specified in `knowledge/user_preference.txt` and are loaded into the context.
    *   **Roadmap:** Expand the scope of customizable preferences (e.g., default tool settings, output verbosity). Consider a more structured configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON) for preferences.

7.  **Interactive Debugging and Profiling:**
    *   **Status:** Basic profiling via `ExecutionProfilerTool`. CrewAI's verbose logging aids in debugging.
    *   **Roadmap:** Explore options for more interactive debugging if complex issues arise. Enhance profiling to provide more actionable insights.

8.  **Enhanced Web Search Capabilities:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented. `WebResearcher` agent uses `SerpAPITool` and `WebsiteTool`.
    *   **Roadmap:** Investigate adding more search APIs or advanced web scraping techniques. Consider adding summarization capabilities to the `WebResearcher` for digesting large content.

9.  **Code Execution Safety Enhancements:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented. `SafeShellTool` uses an `allowed_commands` list to restrict execution.
    *   **Roadmap:** Continuously review and update allowed commands. For more robust sandboxing, explore containerization or dedicated secure execution environments (this is a significant undertaking).
