# Global Instructions

Paths below use the default Claude home. Resolve them against the actual `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set.

## Memory System

### Architecture

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`: Global instructions, auto-loaded
- `~/.claude/lessons.md`: **Global** corrections & lessons (cross-project), read at startup; the optional SessionStart hook prints it, or asks for a Read when the file is 9,000 bytes or larger
- Project `MEMORY.md`: `~/.claude/projects/<path>/memory/MEMORY.md`, **Project-level** preferences & context (current project only), auto-loaded

### Storage Decision

When the user asks to "remember X", determine the scope first:
- **Would this apply in a different project?** → Global, write to `~/.claude/lessons.md`
- **Only relevant to the current project?** → Project-level, write to the project's `MEMORY.md`

### Self-Correction

**Identifying corrections** (low threshold): user points out errors, says "remember/don't again...", shows frustration, same operation fails 2+ times.

**Post-correction flow**:
1. **Determine scope** (see Storage Decision above), write to the appropriate file
2. Rules must be concrete instructions to prevent recurrence
3. Only after writing, continue handling the user's request

**Rule promotion**: `CLAUDE.md` can only be modified when the user **explicitly asks**.

## Core Settings

- Language: respond in the user's preferred language; code comments may use English; keep technical terms in English
- Shell: Zsh (`~/.zshrc`) on macOS/Linux; Bash (Git Bash) on Windows

## Python Environment

Use the project's existing interpreter or environment. Activate Conda only when the project uses it; otherwise use its configured venv or a temporary environment. Prepare dependencies only for the requested task.

## Network & Proxy

- Proxy via SSH reverse port forwarding: `ssh -R <remote_port>:127.0.0.1:<local_port>`, set `http_proxy`/`https_proxy`
- Do not modify `.bashrc`, `.profile`, or VSCode config unless explicitly asked
- Prefer user-space solutions when no `sudo` access

## Communication Preferences

- When the user says a cause is **not** the problem, **immediately stop** that direction and pivot
- Prefer writing code over repeated questions; after multiple requests, just implement with assumptions noted in comments

## Configuration Maintenance

Invoke `edit-config` when the user wants to inspect, add, change, remove, repair, or update Claude/Codex configuration managed by this repository, including its templates and catalogue. If it is unavailable, read and follow [its branch-specific instructions](https://github.com/Mizoreww/awesome-agent-config/blob/main/skills/edit-config/SKILL.md) without installing extra content. Queries remain read-only; changes follow the user's selected scope.

## Workflow

- Web search: before searching, determine the current real date — prefer system command (`date '+%Y-%m-%d'` / `Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd'`), fall back to web time API if system clock may be inaccurate. Include the year (and month if relevant) in search queries. Never rely solely on model knowledge or system prompt for the date.
- Subagent strategy: one task per subagent, keep main context clean
- Verify before marking done (run tests, check logs)
- Fix bugs directly — don't ask for repeated confirmation

## Version Changelog

When making version-level changes to a project (new features, major refactors, architectural changes, breaking changes), maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root:

```markdown
## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Features
- What was changed
### Design Rationale
- Why it was done this way, what trade-offs were considered
### Notes & Caveats
- Edge cases, compatibility, migration concerns, etc.
```

- Not every commit needs an entry — only update on **version-level changes**
- Does not conflict with CLAUDE.md: CLAUDE.md manages instructions, CHANGELOG.md tracks evolution
- Create the file proactively if it doesn't exist

## Code Review

Use the user's selected review workflow. When installed and configured, use `adversarial-review` for cross-model review or Matt Pocock's `code-review` for Standards/Spec review. If the selected workflow is unavailable, explain the missing prerequisite and review with available tools; install additional capabilities only when selected.
