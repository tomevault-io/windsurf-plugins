# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

Dreamfall is an exploratory Vite browser playground for real-time 3D gameplay, procedural world generation, animation, physics, terrain editing, vehicles, weather, and rendering experiments. It uses JavaScript modules, Solid UI components, Three.js, Rapier, Vite, Playwright, and Cloudflare/Wrangler tooling.

This is an active prototype workspace, not a polished engine. Prefer focused, locally consistent changes over broad refactors.

## Core Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run locally: `npm run dev`
- Build production assets: `npm run build`
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`
- Visual smoke test: `npm run visual-smoke`
- Deploy: `npm run deploy`

Useful targeted checks from `package.json`:

- `npm run verify:game-runtime-boundary`
- `npm run verify:fixed-step`
- `npm run verify:determinism`
- `npm run verify:clouds`
- `npm run verify:post-effects`
- `npm run verify:vehicle-spawn`
- `npm run verify:vehicle-suspension`
- `npm run verify:vehicle-damage`
- `npm run verify:road-intersections`
- `npm run verify:world-road`

Run the smallest relevant verification command for the subsystem you changed. Run `npm run build` when changing shared runtime, rendering, imports, asset loading, Vite config, or deployment behavior.

## Adding a Runtime System

`GameRuntime.js` is a closed facade. A new system must not edit it (`git diff -- src/game/core/GameRuntime.js` should stay empty). Checklist:

1. Implement under `src/game/systems/` or a focused feature directory.
2. Register construction in `src/game/runtime/createRuntimeServices.js` (or let a feature own it).
3. Add startup/disposal hooks via lifecycle / owning feature / `RuntimeLoader`.
4. Add a named frame step in `src/game/runtime/runtimeFramePlan.js` or the feature’s step list; implement the tick in `RuntimeFramePipeline` (or a feature phase).
5. Register snapshot contributors in `RuntimeSnapshotStore` only if UI/probes need them.
6. Add debug commands under `src/game/debug/runtime/*DebugCommands.js` only if necessary.
7. Add a targeted `scripts/verify-*.mjs` for ordering/behavior.
8. Confirm `npm run verify:game-runtime-boundary` still passes.

## Repository Map

- `src/main.js`: application entry loader.
- `src/bootstrap.jsx`: Solid app mount.
- `src/ui/`: Solid app shell, HUD, editor, and canvas components.
- `src/game/core/`: public `GameRuntime` facade, frame loop, stats, and render-rate limiting.
- `src/game/runtime/`: runtime kernel, services, lifecycle, loader, frame pipeline, snapshots, commands, features, and mode controllers. **New systems wire here, not into `GameRuntime.js`.**
- `src/game/debug/runtime/`: `__DREAMFALL_DEBUG__` bridge host and domain command modules.
- `src/game/systems/`: gameplay, rendering, physics, camera, animation, traversal, vehicle, combat, weather, and level systems.
- `src/game/world/`: runtime level, terrain, road, river, city, and collider construction.
- `src/game/characters/`: player and character model factories, animation controllers, cloth setup.
- `src/game/vehicles/`: vehicle logic, garage builds, audio, tire effects, and deformation.
- `src/game/render/`: post effects, shadows, clouds, weather rendering utilities.
- `src/world/terrain/`: reusable chunked heightfield terrain modules.
- `src/world/worldMap/`: world-map schema, road/river profiles, track frames, and scene data.
- `src/map/`: map builder/editor implementation.
- `src/three-addons/`: vendored Three.js-style helpers, nodes, generators, and utilities.
- `public/`: static runtime assets copied into builds.
- `assets-source/`: source assets used to produce runtime assets.
- `scripts/`: conversion, probing, screenshot, smoke, and targeted verification tools.
- `docs/`: plans, analyses, and subsystem notes.
- `data/`: local editor/database output; treat as generated local state.

## Development Practices

- Preserve existing module style and subsystem boundaries.
- Use existing systems and helpers before adding new global state or duplicate utilities.
- Keep runtime systems deterministic where practical. Be careful with time-step, physics, and animation changes.
- Dispose Three.js resources when replacing meshes, geometries, materials, textures, render targets, or scene-owned objects.
- Avoid blocking the frame loop with expensive generation. Use existing workers, chunking, caches, and probe scripts as examples.
- Treat asset paths in `public/assets` as runtime contracts; check all callers before renaming or moving files.
- Do not commit generated local state from `data/`, `.wrangler/`, `.codex-tmp/`, `dist/`, or editor caches.
- Avoid broad formatting-only edits in large files.

## Frontend and Rendering Notes

- The first screen is the usable playground/editor experience, not a landing page.
- Match the existing dense tool UI style for editor and debug surfaces.
- Verify 3D/rendering changes visually with `npm run visual-smoke` or a targeted Playwright/probe script when possible.
- For canvas or WebGPU/WebGL changes, check both desktop and mobile-sized viewports when the UI surface is affected.
