## Build and Validation Commands

```bash
# Frontend development
bun run dev              # Start Vite dev server
bun run build            # Typecheck + build for production
bun run typecheck        # TypeScript type checking only

# Tauri (full app)
bun run tauri:dev        # Development mode with hot reload
bun run tauri:build      # Production build

# Validation and testing
bun run lint             # ESLint
bun run format           # Prettier (write); format:check verifies
bun run test             # Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:run         # Run tests once
bun run test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage (enforces thresholds)
bun run test:benchmark   # Run detector benchmarks
bun run check:bundle     # Build + initial-bundle size budget
bun run validate         # typecheck + lint + format:check + frontend tests
bun run validate:all     # Frontend validation + Rust fmt/check/test/clippy

# Rust backend
bun run check:rust       # cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
bun run test:rust        # cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
bun run clippy:rust      # cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- -D warnings
cargo build --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript / React

- ESLint (typescript-eslint type-checked + react-hooks) and Prettier are
  enforced; run `bun run lint` and `bun run format:check` (or `bun run validate`)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive computations
- Use `useRef` for mutable values that do not trigger re-renders
- Use the centralized logger (`src/lib/logger.ts`) instead of `console.*` in production code
- Use named constants for magic numbers
- Always clean up effects (intervals, subscriptions, event listeners)

### Rust / Tauri

- Run `bun run clippy:rust` before committing Rust changes
- Use `log::info/warn/error` instead of `println!`
- Validate all external inputs, including paths, scene files, model files, IPC payloads, ROS URLs, Zenoh topics, and CDR payload metadata
- Use `spawn_blocking` for CPU-intensive operations in async contexts

## Architecture Notes

### Frontend (`src/`)

- `components/` - React UI components
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `ros/` - ROS bridge, Gazebo integration, Zenoh transport adapters, performance monitoring
- `detection/` - ML detection types, sensor fusion, and scenario fixtures
- `physics/` - Drone physics simulation
- `simulation/` - Interception system
- `state/` - Scene serialization and persistence

### Backend (`src-tauri/`)

- `common/` - Shared detection, NMS, YOLO, error, and path validation utilities
- `inference/` - ML abstraction layer with CoreML default on macOS, experimental MLX YOLOv8 safetensors path, CUDA/TensorRT on Linux, and ONNX fallback
- `transport/` - Zenoh-oriented transport, CDR validation, and Tauri transport commands
- `ncp/` - Neuro-Cybernetic Protocol (NCP) client for Engram/Paper2Brain — native Rust+Zenoh, behind the off-by-default `ncp` feature; uses the canonical NCP SDK in the sibling `Paper2Brain/ncp` workspace. Non-invasive: does not change the default command surface. See `src/ncp/README.md`. (The TypeScript WebSocket peer is `src/neuro/`.)
- `sensor_fusion.rs` - Kalman/EKF/UKF/Particle/IMM filters
- `lib.rs` - Tauri IPC commands and app setup

## Performance Guidelines

- Use `CircularBuffer` for high-frequency position data
- Prefer squared distance comparisons (avoid `sqrt()`)
- Use `ImageBitmap` for browser-native image decoding
- Memoize derived state to prevent unnecessary recomputes
- Keep camera feed updates at the documented 83ms interval unless profiling justifies a change

## Testing

Test files use Vitest. Place tests in `__tests__/` directories or use `.test.ts` suffix.

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
```

Before committing, prefer `bun run validate:all` unless the change is documentation-only and clearly cannot affect code.

Do not add Claude, AI assistants, or agents as commit/PR co-authors — no `Co-Authored-By:` trailer and no "Generated with Claude Code" / 🤖 line in commit messages or pull-request descriptions.

## Documentation Consistency

Tracked Markdown files should agree on validation commands, backend status, roadmap items, model assumptions, and security boundaries. Keep these files synchronized when behavior changes:

- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `docs/*.md`
- `public/models/README.md`
- `ros/README.md`
- `.github/**/*.md`
- `.windsurf/workflows/*.md`

For documentation-only edits, run `git diff --check` at minimum. Run `bun run validate:all` when the edit reflects or accompanies Rust, IPC, model-loading, transport, ROS, scene, or sensor-fusion behavior changes. For documentation-only edits (Markdown files with no command, status, or behavior changes), run `git diff --check` at minimum.
