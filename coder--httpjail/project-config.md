# Agent instructions

## Performance

All proxying must be done on a streaming basis so that all types of requests are
supported at minimal latency and a constant memory overhead.

Any time we need to read a specific number of bytes from the stream (e.g. to determine
protocol), we must establish a timeout for the operation.

Timeouts must not preclude long-running connections such as GRPC or WebSocket.

## Building

For faster builds during development and debugging, use the `fast` profile:

```bash
cargo build --profile fast
```

This profile inherits from release mode but uses lower optimization levels and disables LTO
for significantly faster build times while still providing reasonable performance.

## Testing

When writing tests, prefer pure rust solutions over shell script wrappers.

**Important:** Shell script based tests (`.sh` files) should NOT be committed to the repository. They are acceptable for transient testing during development (WIP), but all submitted tests must be written in Rust as either integration or unit tests. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and proper CI integration.

**Test Philosophy:** Write terse, minimal tests that cover the essential behavior. Avoid verbose test suites with many similar test cases. Each test should have a clear, specific purpose. Prefer 1-2 focused tests over 5-10 comprehensive tests. This keeps the test suite fast and maintainable.

### Debugging Test Failures

**Prefer logging over temporary scripts for debugging.** Tests automatically have tracing enabled via `ctor` initialization in `tests/common/logging.rs`. To debug test failures:

1. Run tests with `RUST_LOG=debug cargo test` to see detailed logging
2. Add `tracing::debug!()` or `tracing::info!()` statements rather than `println!` or temporary test files
3. The logging setup uses `try_init()` so it won't panic if already initialized

This approach ensures:
- Debugging information is available in CI logs
- No temporary files clutter the repository
- Debugging aids can be left in place without affecting normal test runs

When testing behavior outside of the strong jailing, use `--weak` for an environment-only
invocation of the tool. `--weak` works by setting the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment
variables to the proxy address.

### Integration Tests

The integration tests run against the binary built by Cargo; no manual environment variables are required. On Linux, run the strong-jail integration tests with sudo:

```bash
sudo -E cargo test --test linux_integration
```

Weak-mode tests (environment-only, cross-platform) run without sudo:

```bash
cargo test --test weak_integration
```

Run the full suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Test Performance Requirements

**All tests must complete within seconds, not minutes.** The CI timeout is set to 30 seconds per test. Tests that require longer operations (like timeouts) should use minimal durations:

- Use `HttpjailCommand::timeout(2)` for timeout tests with `sleep 3`
- Network tests should use `--connect-timeout 5 --max-time 8` for curl commands
- Any test taking longer than a few seconds should be optimized or redesigned

This ensures fast feedback during development and prevents CI timeouts.

### Test Parallelism

**Integration tests should run in parallel by default.** The jails are designed to be independent from each other, so the test suite should leverage good parallelism. Tests should only be marked as serial (`#[serial]`) when there's a specific global resource that would be contended, such as:

- Global system settings that affect all processes
- Shared network ports or interfaces
- System-wide firewall rules that can't be isolated

Each jail operates in its own network namespace (on Linux) or with its own proxy port, so most tests can safely run concurrently. This significantly reduces total test runtime.


## Cargo Cache

Occasionally you will encounter permissions issues due to running the tests under sudo. In these cases,
DO NOT `cargo clean`. Instead, `chown -R <user> target`.

## macOS

- macOS uses weak mode (environment-only) and does not use PF. No root/sudo required for standard usage or tests.
- To run integration tests on macOS, prefer the weak-mode suite:
  ```bash
  cargo test --test weak_integration
  ```

### Certificate Trust on macOS

- **curl and most CLI tools**: Respect the `SSL_CERT_FILE`/`SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variables that httpjail sets, so they work even without the CA in the system keychain
- **Go programs (gh, go, etc.)**: Use the macOS Security.framework and ignore environment variables, requiring the CA to be installed in the keychain via `httpjail trust --install`
- When the CA is not trusted in the keychain, httpjail will:
  - Still attempt TLS interception (not pass-through)
  - Warn that applications may fail with certificate errors
  - Go programs will fail to connect until `httpjail trust --install` is run

## Documentation

User-facing documentation should be in the README.md file.

Code/testing/contributing documentation should be here.

When updating any user-facing interface of the tool in a way that breaks compatibility or adds a new feature, update the README.md file.

## Clippy

CI requires the following to pass on both macOS and Linux targets:
