# Solidity Testing Conventions (Foundry)

Applies to first-party tests under `test/` (do not modify dependency tests under `lib/`).

## Directory structure (required)

- `test/lib/`
  - Base test harness contracts (shared fixtures + helpers)
  - Shared mocks/utilities used across multiple suites
- `test/unit/<Area>/`
  - Unit tests scoped to a single contract/function/feature area
  - Prefer one `.t.sol` per function or tightly-related group of functions unless contract is quite small (less than 4 testable functions)

Recommended shape (examples):
- `test/lib/PolicyManagerTestBase.sol`
- `test/lib/mocks/MockCoinbaseSmartWallet.sol`
- `test/unit/PolicyManager/executeWithInstall.t.sol`
- `test/unit/policies/MorphoLoanProtectionPolicy/MorphoLoanProtectionPolicy.t.sol`

## Base harness pattern (required)

- Put shared deployment/setup/helpers in an `abstract contract <X>TestBase is Test` under `test/lib/`.
- Child unit tests inherit the base and call a single base setup entrypoint from `setUp()`.
  - Base setup entrypoint naming should be explicit (e.g. `setUpPolicyManagerBase()`, `setUpMorphoLoanProtectionBase()`).
- Centralize “builders” and helpers in the base:
  - Signature helpers (`_hashTypedData`, `_signInstall`, etc.)
  - Common fixtures (accounts, deployed contracts, default configs)
  - Fuzz bounds helpers (wrap `bound()` into semantically-named helpers)

## Golden reference (recommended)

- Use `test/unit/PolicyManager/execute.t.sol` as the canonical reference for:
  - Fuzzing style (maximize meaningful fuzzing, avoid discarding by deriving offsets/seeds)
  - Typed revert assertions and event expectations
  - NatSpec on tests/helpers (including `@param` for all fuzz params)
  - Helper layout inside a test file

## Naming + organization

- **Test file names**:
  - Contract-scoped suites: `ContractName.t.sol`
  - Function-scoped suites: `functionName.t.sol` (lower camelCase; matches the Solidity function name)
- **Test contract names**:
  - Contract-scoped suites: `ContractNameTest`
  - Function-scoped suites: `FunctionNameTest` (CapWords, even when the file is lower camelCase like `install.t.sol`)
- **Test function names**:
  - If contract name already scopes the function, use `test_outcome_optionalContext`
  - Otherwise use `test_functionName_outcome_optionalContext`

Keep separation of concerns:
- Core protocol tests separate from policy/hook tests.
- Policy/hook suites focus on authorization, input validation, math/bounds, replay/nonce, lifecycle (install/execute/uninstall), and event emission.

## NatSpec for tests (required)

- Test functions MUST have a NatSpec `@notice` that describes the case being asserted.
- Any fuzzed test function MUST NatSpec every parameter with `@param <name> ...` (no unnamed parameters).
- Use `@dev` only when it adds durable clarity (e.g., expected typed error, important invariants, or why a bound/transform is used).

## Reverts + events (preferred patterns)

- Reverts:
  - Prefer typed errors: `vm.expectRevert(SomeError.selector)`
  - If args matter: `vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(SomeError.selector, ...))`
- Events:
  - Use `vm.expectEmit(...)` and emit the event with expected args immediately before the call.
  - Give **each unique event emission** its own dedicated test (do not bundle event assertions with state/happy-path assertions, even if redundant).
  - For “should not emit” cases, prefer `vm.recordLogs()` + scan for the signature.

## Assertion scope (preferred)

- Prefer **one thing per test**:
  - A test should usually validate a single expected outcome (one revert, one event emission, or one state transition).
  - Avoid packing multiple unrelated subcases into a single test.
- Multiple assertions are fine when they are all part of probing the **same desired end state** (e.g., several state fields that jointly define correctness).

## Fuzzing conventions (required)

- Prefer `bound()` over `vm.assume()` when possible.
- Define meaningful constants for fuzz bounds (no magic numbers).
- Every fuzz parameter must be used (or be explicitly part of the stub-only phase; see below).
- Keep assumptions minimal and targeted (e.g., inequality between two bounded addresses).

## Stub-first workflow (required)

When creating new coverage, **stub the full case matrix first** (tests compile, run, and are explicitly skipped), then implement bodies in a later pass.

### Stub rule

- A stub test MUST call `vm.skip(true);` to keep `forge test` green while the case is still being specified.
- The stub’s NatSpec/docstring should clearly state the expected revert/event/state transitions (this is the “spec”).

Example stub shape:

```solidity
function test_reverts_whenFooIsBar(uint256 x) public {
    vm.skip(true);
}
```
