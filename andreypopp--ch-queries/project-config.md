# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project overview

This is an OCaml project named "ch_queries" using dune as the build system.

## Building and debugging the project

- Build project with `dune build <dir>`, build often while doing changes, so
  you can catch errors early
- To run tests:
  - `dune test <specific test>` runs a specific test, prefer it when working on a specific feature
  - `dune test` runs all tests, run it at the end to validate everything works
- When running an executable, use `dune exec ch_queries -- ARGS...`

If you need verify something or debug some thing, it's a good idea to add a
small test instead and run it with `dune test <test_file>`. Consider keeping
the test in `test/` directory if it's generally useful.

## How to add tests

- Add test cases in `test/` directory in cram format (`*.t` files).
- Run them: `dune test test/<your_test_file>.t`
- Verify outputs are correct.
- To update expected outputs after verifying correctness: `dune test --auto-promote`

## Project structure

- **ch_queries/** - core libary which implements typesafe DSL combinators for query generation
- **ch_queries_syntax/** - surface syntax + lexer/parser for the DSL
    - **syntax.ml** - AST types and data structures for the DSL
    - **lexer.mll** - lexer for the DSL (tokens are defined in the parser)
    - **parser.mly** - parser for the DSL
    - **printer.ml** - printer for the syntax, uses pprint library
    - **ulexer.mll** - lexer for unsafe expressions (`%eu`), only recognizes `$param` and `x.y` refs
    - **uparser.mly** - parser for unsafe expressions
    - **loc.ml** - source location types
    - **eq_class.ml** - equivalence classes for the type system
- **ch_queries_ppx/** - a ppx rewriter which translates surface syntax to the typesafe DSL combinators
- **bin/** - some debug UI
- **test/** - tests in cram format (`*.t`)
    - to run: `dune test`
    - to run and promote the changes in expected vs current: `dune test --auto-promote`, only use when you've verified the changes are correct

when exploring a project structure, it is fine to read entire files (they are small)

## Architecture overview

The `ch_queries_ppx` parses the surface syntax with `ch_queries_syntax` and
translates it to the typesafe DSL combinators defined in `ch_queries`.

The `ch_queries` combinators are being translated back to `ch_queries_syntax`
but only to the subset which maps to SQL. Which is then printed to SQL string.

## Adding new syntax features

When adding new syntax to the query language, follow this pattern:

1. **Add to syntax.ml**: Define the AST types for the new feature
2. **Add to lexer.mll**: Add new keywords to the keywords table and handle in string_of_token
3. **Add to parser.mly**:
   - Add token declarations
   - Add parsing rules
   - Include new fields in existing rules (e.g., SELECT queries)
4. **If adding new column/param-like constructs**: Consider updating ulexer.mll/uparser.mly for `%eu` support
5. **Update printer.ml**: Add pretty-printing support for the new syntax
6. **Update ch_queries.ml**: Add the feature to the core DSL types and translation
7. **Update ch_queries.mli**: Add interface signatures for new functions
8. **Update ch_queries_ppx.ml**: Add PPX transformation support
9. **Run `dune build`** and fix any build errors systematically

Always check that interface files (.mli) match implementation files (.ml) when adding new optional parameters to functions.

## Adding new ClickHouse types

Simple named types (like `JSON`, `String`, `Int32`) need no syntax changes — they
are parsed as `T "TypeName"` by the existing grammar. To add a new one:

1. **ch_queries.ml / ch_queries.mli**: Define a phantom type if needed (e.g.
   `type json0 = private Json`), or reuse an existing OCaml type (e.g. `json`
   polymorphic variant, `string`, `int`). Types like `int` and `string` are
   reused directly; compound types like `date` use phantom types (`date0
   timestamp`).
2. **ch_queries_ppx.ml — `stage_typ'`**: Add a pattern matching the type name
   string to the OCaml phantom type (e.g. `T { node = "JSON"; _ } ->
   (\`NON_NULL, [%type: Ch_queries.json])`).
3. **ch_queries_ppx.ml — `stage_typ_to_parser`**: Add a pattern mapping the
   type name to a `Parse.t` value (e.g. `T { node = "JSON"; _ } -> [%expr
   Ch_queries.Parse.json]`).
4. **ch_queries.ml — `Parse` module**: Add a `Parse.t` value that pairs a JSON
   decoder with an SQL expression constructor (e.g. `let json = VAL (Fun.id,
   unparse)`). Expose it in `ch_queries.mli`.
5. **Add tests** in `test/` covering type position (`[%t "..."]`), expression
   ascription (`::TypeName`), query column usage, and `Parse` round-tripping.

## Code Style

- **Naming**: `snake_case` for values/functions/types, `My_module` for modules/variants
- **Philosophy**: Unix-style - do one thing well, fail loudly, clarity over cleverness
- **Interfaces**: One `.mli` per `.ml`, keep minimal
- **Docs**: Terse first line, document invariants not obvious behavior
- **Errors**: `function_name: what went wrong` format, fail fast
- **Type annotations**: Avoid explicit types unless required by type checker
- **Git Commits**:
