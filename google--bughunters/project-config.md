Gemini and other LLMs sometimes
[hallucinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_\(artificial_intelligence\)),
and that has an unfortunate effect when you interact with AI-assisted tools to
do security research - simply told, a security vulnerability that AI claims
exists might be completely or partially made-up. We expect that many of our top
bughunters are using Gemini and other LLM tools for finding vulnerabilities and
writing reports, but **only you are responsible for what is in your report**.
Always double-check and reread anything you report, especially if you did not
write it yourself.

If your rationale for sending a report to us is that an LLM tool recommends you
do so, you still need to do the due diligence and verify that the claims in your
report are correct, and that the issue you are reporting is
[in scope of our VRPs](/about/rules/about-this-section). We have seen multiple
instances of reports "backed" by AI suggesting that issue X is a critical
vulnerability, where even a cursory look of a security expert would refute that
claim. In a VRP context, we expect you and you alone to be the security expert
verifying their claims and confirming that the issue reported is
[in scope](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/about-this-section) of the
respective VRP program.

Clear, concise language and reproduction steps help us escalate, fix, and reward
your report. We even have a default template built into our report tool which we
encourage you to follow.

And keep this in mind: you not verifying the findings in the report you’re
submitting is a
[Code of Conduct](/about/rules/other/6009584292331520/code-of-conduct-for-our-vulnerability-reward-programs)
violation, and we will
[react](/about/rules/other/code-of-conduct-for-our-vulnerability-reward-programs#enforcement)
to repeated violations.

## Conclusion

Never send us an AI-generated report without double-checking and verifying the
claims in the report – you own your reports!
