# Claude-to-Antigravity Delegation Rules

You are equipped with a custom MCP tool called `delegate_to_agy`. You **MUST** use this tool to offload heavy, token-intensive tasks to save your own context window.

## The routing gate - consume vs. operate

Before any read, search, or analysis, pick the mode:

- **Operate-on** - code you're about to edit. Read the file and edit it yourself - even if it's over 200 lines; don't delegate it. Never edit from a summary.
- **Consume-and-discard** - you want a verdict, not the bytes (audits, searches, reviews, git history, external research). Delegate to agy.
- **Unsure which mode?** If you don't yet know whether you'll edit, treat it as consume and delegate. Only keep it local once you've committed to editing it.
- **Discovery is always consume.** "Find all X across module Y", "which files use pattern Z", "where are the assert() calls" - these are grep/multi-file analysis even if editing immediately follows. Delegate to agy to get the file list, then read only the specific files you'll edit. The fact that editing comes next does NOT make the discovery step operate-on.

If a review leads straight into editing the same file, read it locally once - don't delegate then re-read it.

## Terminal Command Delegation

**BEFORE** running ANY of these commands in a terminal, you MUST use `delegate_to_agy` instead:

- `grep` - always delegate. Flag combinations (`-r`, `-A`, `-B`, `-C`) make output size unpredictable regardless of `-m`.
- `git diff` / `git log` - delegate by default. **Exception:** when you can bound it small and need it inline - `git log -n 5`, `git diff --stat`, a `git diff` of the single file you just touched - run it directly.

**NEVER** run grep directly. **NEVER** run unbounded `git diff` / `git log` directly. This applies during ALL phases: planning, exploration, implementation, review.

## Delegation Thresholds

Consume-and-discard work goes to agy per the gate above. On top of that, delegate when ANY of these conditions are met:

1. **File length >200 lines**: Any analysis, review, or reading of files exceeding 200 lines.
2. **Multi-file analysis (>3 files)**: Bug hunting, architecture review, or debugging spanning more than 3 files.
3. **Web/external knowledge**: Documentation lookups, current-info queries, research digs - always delegate. A fetched page lands in context whole, however small the answer.
4. **Adversarial review / plan critique**: Always delegate.

If you are unsure whether a file exceeds 200 lines, delegate it anyway - Antigravity CLI handles the cost, not you.

## STOP & VERIFY

**You are violating these rules if**:

- You edited from agy's summary instead of reading the file yourself. Editing is local - never edit from a summary.
- You ran `grep` directly, or an **unbounded** `git diff` / `git log` in-terminal instead of delegating. (Bounded git commands like `-n 5` or `--stat` are fine).
- You read a whole file over 200 lines locally to audit or review it, instead of delegating.
- You answered a consume trigger from memory instead of verifying - code changes.
