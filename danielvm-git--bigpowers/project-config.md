description: Multi-phase UAT gate — cold-start smoke, build, typecheck, lint, tests, step-by-step manual verification, gaps-closure loop. Use after execute-plan or develop-tdd, before audit-code.

# Verify Work

> **HARD GATE** — No story is "done" until manual UAT for the active story is confirmed with evidence.
>
> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT run on `main` or `master`. Use the feature branch from `kickoff-branch`.

Review answers "is the code good?"; Verify answers "does the built thing do what was promised?"

## Modes

- Default: full UAT plus gaps loop
- --smoke: Cold-start only plus one happy-path flow. Use for hotfixes.
- --cli: CLI tool verification — replaces cold-start with binary smoke checklist. Use for CLI tools with no server process.

## Process

> **Timing:** `bash scripts/bp-timing.sh start verify-work` at invocation; `bash scripts/bp-timing.sh end verify-work` before handoff.

0. **Branch check** — must not be `main`/`master`.

1. Read active story tasks from `specs/epics/<capsule>/eNNsYY-tasks.yaml` and story spec from `specs/epics/<capsule>/eNNsYY-<slug>.md` (countable-story-format, Gherkin in §17).
1a. **Pre-UAT verify validation** — for each task's `verify:` command, run it and detect pattern mismatches before UAT begins. If a grep/awk/jq command fails, check whether the pattern is wrong vs. a genuine failure:
    ```bash
    # For a failing grep -q 'PATTERN' FILE, check what is actually in FILE
    grep 'PATTERN' FILE || grep -n '' FILE | head -20   # show nearest lines
    ```
    Report: `"Pattern 'X' not found. Nearest match: 'Y' at line N"` and ask `"Update verify command? [Y/n]"`. Fix before proceeding — a mismatched verify command produces false failures during UAT.
2. **Cold-start smoke** (if app): stop server, clear caches, boot from scratch.
3. **AGENTS.md preflight** — before running default checks, call `bash scripts/bp-read-agents.sh` to detect project-specific commands. If `BP_PREFLIGHT` is set, run it instead of the default mechanical gates (or in addition to them if the project requires both). Output: `"Using preflight from AGENTS.md: <cmd>"`. Fall back to `CLAUDE.md` commands if AGENTS.md is absent.
4. Mechanical gates: build → typecheck → lint → tests (from `CLAUDE.md` or AGENTS.md).
5. **Step-by-step UAT** — one user-observable action at a time.
6. **Gaps loop** — failures → log → `plan-work` → re-verify.

## Verify sub-operations

### Cold-Start Smoke (absorbed)

For applications, verify correctness from a clean state:

- Stop the running server (if any)
- Clear any caches (browser, application caches, compiled artifacts)
- Boot the application from scratch
- Verify that no stale artifacts or configuration are affecting the behavior

This catches environment-specific bugs and ensures the build is reproducible.

### Gaps Loop (absorbed)

After UAT, identify and close any gaps between promised behavior and actual behavior:

- Capture what was promised in the epic task description
- Document what actually happened (expected vs actual)
- If behavior doesn't match the promises, log the gap
- Loop back to `plan-work` or `develop-tdd` to fix the gap
- Re-verify until all gaps are closed (gaps count = 0)

## UAT dialogue

- Pass: user confirms per step.
- Fail: capture expected vs actual; do not mark done in `execution-status.yaml`.

## Persist verification evidence

After UAT passes, write structured evidence to `specs/verifications/eNNsYY-verify.yaml`:

```yaml
story_id: e01s01
verified_at: "2026-06-11T14:30:00Z"
verifier: verify-work
phases:
  smoke:
    passed: true
  build:
    passed: true
    command: "npm run build"
  typecheck:
    passed: true
  lint:
    passed: true
  tests:
    passed: true
    coverage: "94.2%"
  manual:
    steps:
      - step: "Open /login"
        expected: "Login form renders"
        actual: "Login form rendered correctly"
        passed: true
  gaps:
    closed: true
```

> **HARD GATE** — Verification evidence MUST be persisted before marking the story done. No evidence = not verified.

## --cli mode

For CLI tools where cold-start smoke (stop server / clear caches) does not apply. Auto-detected when the project has no server process (no `listen()`, no `server.js`, no blocking `main()`); or explicitly activated with `--cli`.

**Auto-detect binary name:**
```bash
# Cargo.toml
BINARY=$(grep '^name' Cargo.toml | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}')
# package.json
BINARY=$(node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').bin && Object.keys(require('./package.json').bin)[0] || '')" 2>/dev/null)
# Makefile
BINARY=$(grep '^BIN\s*=' Makefile 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $3}')
```

**CLI verification checklist (replaces cold-start smoke):**

1. `--help` smoke: `$BINARY --help` → assert output contains "Usage"
2. `--version` check: `$BINARY --version` → assert version matches manifest (Cargo.toml / package.json)
3. Happy-path: run documented example command from README.md → assert non-empty output
4. Edge case: `$BINARY --invalid-flag` → assert exit code ≠ 0 and error message printed

No "stop server" or "clear caches" steps are executed in `--cli` mode. Steps 3–6 of the default process (mechanical gates, UAT, gaps loop) still run unchanged.

## Verify

→ verify: `test -f specs/verifications/<story_id>-verify.yaml && echo "Evidence persisted"`

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for cold-start and gaps template.
