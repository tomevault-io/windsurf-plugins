# Setup Environment
> **HARD GATE** — **HARD GATE** — Environment setup must be idempotent and reproducible. If setup fails, provide clear error messages and remediation steps. Do NOT assume prior state.


Idempotent prep so BUILD phase commands succeed on first run.

## Checklist

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` / `CONVENTIONS.md` for required runtimes and commands.
2. Verify runtime versions (`node -v`, `swift --version`, etc.).
3. Install dependencies (`npm ci`, `bundle install`, etc.) — prefer lockfile installs.
4. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` if documented; never commit secrets.
5. Run smoke: lint + one fast test or `--version` on key tools.
6. Record versions in `specs/state.yaml` under Environment.

## Verify

→ verify: commands from CLAUDE.md Test/Lint rows exit 0
