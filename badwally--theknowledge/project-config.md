# ~/code/knowledge/ — Personal Knowledge Base

Canonical knowledge base for all `~/code/*` projects. Implements the LLM Wiki pattern (Karpathy gist `442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f`) with three load-bearing integrations:

- The **wiki** (this repo) is canonical — markdown + YAML frontmatter, citation-graph enforced by the gateway.
- **NotebookLM** is the heavy-synthesis service called *through* the gateway (`wiki nlm-*`); artifacts file back to `wiki/artifacts/`.
- **Obsidian** is the knowledge-graph visualization engine on top of the vault — same wikilink format, same markdown.

This file is the agent control surface. `WIKI.md` is the conventions reference. Read `WIKI.md` before designing converters, page types, gateway operations, validator rules, or editorial policies. Read `index.md` and run `wiki status` to orient on live content. For human-facing usage, read `TUTORIAL.md`. For per-milestone delivery history, read `BUILD.md § 9`.

## What you may do here

- Read any file in `wiki/`, `raw/`, `nlm/`, `index.md`, `log.md`. Reading is unrestricted.
- Propose wiki updates and source ingests **only via the gateway** — never write directly to `wiki/` or `raw/`.
- Read sources to answer questions, then file good answers back into the wiki via `wiki query`, which writes the answer as a wiki page.
- Cite into the wiki from any other `~/code/*` project — wiki paths are stable references.

## Hard rules (no exceptions)

1. **No direct writes to `wiki/` or `raw/`.** All writes go through the gateway: `wiki <subcommand>` (CLI) or `wiki_*` (MCP). Direct file writes are caught by the validator and `git diff` review.
2. **No direct calls to `nlm` or NotebookLM MCP tools.** All NotebookLM operations go through the gateway. The gateway guarantees every NotebookLM artifact is filed back to the wiki with bidirectional links — Discipline Gate.
3. **Citation grounding is mandatory.** Every claim in every wiki page must be followed by `[[sources/<id>]]` linking to the source page. Validator rejects pages with claims lacking provenance. Exception: pages written with `--draft` are committed with `draft: true` and the rule is downgraded to a lint warning until `wiki finalize` is run. Drafts older than 7 days are flagged in lint.
4. **Lookup before create.** Search `index.md` and existing pages before creating a new entity or concept. Validator warns on slug similarity.
5. **Plan before write.** For any incremental ingest, produce a written plan in your response: pages you will create, pages you will update, cross-references you will add. Gateway logs the plan to `log.md`.
6. **Sources in `raw/` are immutable.** Frontmatter may be updated by pipeline stages (filter score, NotebookLM corpus IDs, wiki backlinks). Body content is never modified after ingest.

## When to use which authorship path

| Situation | Path |
|---|---|
| Single source, low-stakes (Web Clipper, voice note, ad-hoc PDF) | Incremental, agent-driven via `wiki ingest` |
| New research domain with 50+ sources, citation fidelity required, output will be referenced externally | Batch, code-driven via `wiki batch-ingest` |
| Unsure | Batch. Fidelity > convenience. |

## Operation guide

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Ingest single source (URL, PDF, audio, m4b) | `wiki ingest <path-or-url> [--domain X] [--with-plan] [--draft]` |
| Ingest a whole vault | `wiki batch-ingest <vault> --legacy-import --domain <slug>` |
| Query the wiki and file a synthesis | `wiki query "<question>" [--domain X] [--draft]` |
| Generate slides from corpus | `wiki nlm-slides <domain> "<topic>"` |
| Generate audio overview | `wiki nlm-audio <domain> "<topic>"` |
| Generate briefing doc | `wiki nlm-briefing <domain>` |
| Revise an artifact | `wiki nlm-revise <slug> --slide N "<instructions>"` |
| Add a source to a NotebookLM corpus | `wiki nlm-add <domain> <source-id>` |
| Run filter on a source | `wiki filter <path>` |
| Pin a corrected filter decision | `wiki filter-correct <id>` |
| Finalize a draft page | `wiki finalize <page-path>` (`--abandon` to delete) |
| Backfill policy + example bank from legacy | `wiki backfill-examples --domain X --legacy-config <yaml> --json <staged.json>` |
| Inspect / distill the example bank | `wiki finetune [--check \| --domain X --distill [--force]]` |
| Run a registered poller (e.g. Apple Notes) | `wiki poll <name>` (`wiki poll --list` to see registered) |
| Health check | `wiki lint [--scope <check>]` |
| Status / watcher heartbeat / pending queue | `wiki status` |

`wiki index --rebuild`, `wiki search`, `wiki migrate <name>` remain stubs (operational sugar). Full reference: `WIKI.md` § Gateway operations.

## Adding a new source type

Write a converter under `src/gateway/converters/<type>.py` that outputs canonical markdown to `raw/<type>/<slug>.md` per the frontmatter schema in `WIKI.md`. Six steps lock the pattern (M29 onward):

1. Add the type string to `paths.SOURCE_TYPES`
2. Add it to `validator.ALLOWED_SOURCE_TYPES` and define an `ID_PATTERNS` regex
3. Implement the converter as a `Converter` subclass with `detect()` + `convert()`
4. Register it in `gateway.converters.__init__._ensure_registered`
