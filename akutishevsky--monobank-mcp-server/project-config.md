# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that bridges Claude AI with the Monobank banking API. Published to npm as `monobank-mcp-server`. Runs as a CLI tool via `npx monobank-mcp-server`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build        # tsc && chmod +x build/index.js
npm run pack:mcpb    # build + package as .mcpb bundle
```

TypeScript compiles from `src/` to `build/`. The output entry point (`build/index.js`) has a shebang and is chmod'd executable. No test or lint scripts exist.

Uses TypeScript 7 (the Go-native compiler). Note that TS 7 no longer auto-includes every `@types/*` package, so `tsconfig.json` sets `"types": ["node"]` explicitly — without it, `process` fails to resolve in `config.ts` and `index.ts`.

## MCPB Support

The project includes a `manifest.json` (MCPB v0.3) for one-click installation in Claude Desktop/Claude Code. The manifest declares all three tools, wires `MONOBANK_API_TOKEN` via `user_config` (secure prompt on install), and requires Node >=18.

`npm run pack:mcpb` builds, then runs `scripts/pack-mcpb.sh`, which stages into `mcpb-staging/` and zips to `monobank-mcp-server.mcpb`:

| Path in bundle | Source |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | copied; `entry_point` is `server/index.js` |
| `package.json` | copied — required at the bundle root so `"type": "module"` applies to `server/*.js` |
| `server/` | contents of `build/` |
| `node_modules/` | `npm ci --omit=dev` against the staged lockfile |

Dependencies are installed fresh rather than copied from the repo's `node_modules`, which would drag dev dependencies in — `typescript@7` alone adds a ~26MB platform-specific Go binary. The install passes `--ignore-scripts`; revisit that if a runtime dependency ever needs a native build step.

## Version Bumping

When bumping the app version, update ALL of these files:

| File | Location |
|------|----------|
| `package.json` | `"version"` field |
| `package-lock.json` | Run `npm install --package-lock-only` after updating `package.json` |
| `src/index.ts` | `version` in `new McpServer({...})` constructor |
| `manifest.json` | `"version"` field |
| `server.json` | `"version"` field (top-level) and `"packages[0].version"` |

## Architecture

The server exposes three MCP tools over stdio transport:

- **get_currency_rates** — public endpoint, rate-limited to once per 5 min
- **get_client_info** — authenticated, rate-limited to once per 60s
- **get_statement** — authenticated, rate-limited to once per 60s, max 31-day range

### Source layout (`src/`)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.ts` | MCP server setup, tool definitions (all three tools registered here) |
| `config.ts` | Lazy-initialized singleton; reads `MONOBANK_API_TOKEN` env var, stores API base URL |
| `schemas.ts` | Zod schemas validating Monobank API responses (`CurrencyRateSchema`, `StatementItemSchema`) |
| `interfaces.ts` | TypeScript interfaces (`CurrencyRate`) |
| `helpers.ts` | Shared utilities: fetch wrapper, MCP response builders, date validation, amount formatting (cents → currency units) |

### Key patterns

- **ESM-only** (`"type": "module"`, target ES2022, module Node16)
- All Monobank API responses are validated at runtime with Zod before use
- Monetary amounts arrive from the API in cents and are converted to currency units in `formatStatementItems()`
- Dates are accepted as ISO 8601 strings and converted to Unix timestamps for the API
- Authenticated endpoints use the `X-Token` header
- Config throws on missing `MONOBANK_API_TOKEN` at initialization

## Formatting

Prettier with 4-space indentation (see `.prettierrc`).

```bash
npm run format       # prettier --write src/
```

There is no lint step. ESLint and `typescript-eslint` were removed when the project moved to TypeScript 7 — the `typescript@7` package ships only a Go binary and no `lib/typescript.js`, so the programmatic compiler API that `typescript-eslint` depends on does not exist. Its peer range (`>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`) refuses TS 7 outright. Revisit once TypeScript 7.1 ships the new compiler API and `typescript-eslint` adds support.

# Claude Code Operating Instructions

## Core Philosophy

Default to **parallel execution** and **web-verified information**. Sequential execution and offline assumptions are fallback modes, not defaults. When in doubt: parallelize, then search.

---

## 1. Parallelization Protocol

### Default Behavior: Parallel-First

**Before starting any multi-step task:**
1. Decompose the full task into atomic subtasks
2. Build a dependency graph — identify which subtasks have no prerequisite outputs
3. Dispatch ALL dependency-free subtasks simultaneously using parallel tool calls
4. Only after their completion, dispatch the next wave of now-unblocked subtasks
5. Repeat until task is complete

**Rule:** If two tasks do not share an input/output dependency, they MUST run in parallel. Sequential execution of independent tasks is a performance violation.

### Parallel Tool Call Patterns

Prefer batching tool calls in a single response turn rather than sequential turns:

```
# CORRECT — dispatch independent reads simultaneously
- Read file A
- Read file B
