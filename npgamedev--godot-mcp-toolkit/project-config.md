# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. This is the
tool-agnostic doc map; Claude Code reads the fuller, Claude-specific
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) instead.

This repo is the **Godot MCP Toolkit** — a Godot 4.2+ editor plugin written in
GDScript. The repo root is also a Godot project used for development; the shipped
plugin lives under `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/`.

## Read these first

Read in order before making changes:

1. [`docs/architecture/README.md`](docs/architecture/README.md) — subsystems,
   the editor/runtime split, and the transport, with diagrams.
2. [`docs/dev/code-standards.md`](docs/dev/code-standards.md) — GDScript style,
   naming, and comment conventions. Follow these for all code you write.
3. [`docs/dev/contract.md`](docs/dev/contract.md) — the request/response and
   transport contract between the toolkit and the server (the toolkit owns it).
   Read before touching dispatch, command results, or the WebSocket protocol.
4. [`docs/dev/glossary.md`](docs/dev/glossary.md) — the project's shared
   vocabulary.
5. [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — architecture decision records: the rationale
   behind the larger design choices.

## Documentation map

The user- and contributor-facing docs, beyond the dev set above:

- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — the full documentation index, organized
  by persona (use it / extend it / contribute to it), including the cross-repo
  content-ownership table.
- [`docs/testing-locally.md`](docs/testing-locally.md) — every test layer, when
  to run it, and how to add coverage for a new tool or an extension.
- [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md) — the canonical
  symptom-to-fix reference (checklist, connectivity probe, per-symptom entries).
- [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) — vulnerability reporting, supported versions,
  the security model, and isolation guidance.
- [`addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/docs/compatibility.md`](addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/docs/compatibility.md)
  — the **shipped** end-user compatibility guide (version tiers, per-tool and
  headless matrices, C# requirement, export stripping). Shipped docs must stay
  self-contained; the contributor side lives in CONTRIBUTING's "Compatibility
  engineering" section.
- [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) — the repo-root one-screen summary with links to the
  canonical docs, for agents that load it first.

When you add a doc, add it to `docs/README.md` and to this map (see the
Documentation section of CONTRIBUTING for the placement rules and the
generated-file list).

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for environment setup, how to run
checks, the commit format, and the pull-request checklist.
