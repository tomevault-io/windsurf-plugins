# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:
- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

## UI Component Policy

- For frontend UI, prefer the project's existing shadcn components and compose them before writing custom interactive primitives.
- If a required component is missing, add the matching shadcn/Radix component and wrap it under `src/components/ui/` so styling, accessibility, focus management, and behavior stay consistent.
- Write a custom component only when shadcn components and their composition APIs cannot satisfy the requirement. Record the reason before doing so.
- Custom UI must still reuse the project's Rhea theme tokens, spacing, radii, states, and accessibility conventions. Do not substitute native interactive shortcuts such as `details/summary` when an appropriate shadcn component exists.

## Git Commit Language

- Use Conventional Commit type prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, and `docs:`.
- Write the commit subject and body in Chinese by default. Use English only when the user explicitly requests it.
