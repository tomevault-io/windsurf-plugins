# BesharaMed ERPNext Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a medical device distribution ERP system built on ERPNext v15.
- **Company**: BesharaMed (Kuwait)
- **Industry**: Medical Device Distribution
- **Currency**: KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)
- **Server**: 192.168.68.50:8080 (Docker on Windows)

## Code Style Rules

### Python (Frappe/ERPNext)
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Always check if doctype/document exists before creating: `if not frappe.db.exists(...)`
- Commit after batch operations: `frappe.db.commit()`
- Use `frappe.get_doc()` for creating documents
- Handle exceptions gracefully with try/except

### ERPNext Specific
- Custom fields use `custom_` prefix
- Workflow states need corresponding Workflow State documents
- Workflow actions need Workflow Action Master documents
- doc_status: 0=Draft, 1=Submitted, 2=Cancelled
- Submitted documents cannot transition back to draft states

### Deployment
- Scripts go in `/DEPLOYMENT/` folder
- Use `bench --site frontend execute module.function` pattern
- Clear cache after deployments: `bench --site frontend clear-cache`
- Docker container: `erpnext-backend-1`

## Approval Thresholds
- Purchase Orders > 5,000 KWD: GM approval required
- Payments > 5,000 KWD: Finance Manager approval
- Journal Entries > 10,000 KWD: Finance Manager approval
- Low-margin quotations (<15%): GM approval

## Medical Device Requirements
- All items require batch tracking (has_batch_no=1)
- Most items require expiry tracking (has_expiry_date=1)
- FEFO (First Expiry First Out) enforcement
- Mandatory QC inspection for incoming goods
- Quarantine workflow for failed QC
