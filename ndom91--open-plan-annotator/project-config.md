# open-plan-annotator: Development Guide

## What This Is

A fully local Claude Code plugin that intercepts `ExitPlanMode` hook events and opens a browser UI for reviewing and annotating plans before code is written. Ships as a package-managed platform runtime binary (compiled via `bun build --compile`) that embeds the React UI. Also works as an OpenCode plugin via the `@opencode-ai/plugin` SDK.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code path:
  Hook fires (ExitPlanMode)
    → bin/open-plan-annotator.mjs   (Node wrapper: buffers stdin, resolves runtime package, delegates)
      → @open-plan-annotator/runtime-*/bin/open-plan-annotator  (compiled Bun binary)
        → Reads hook JSON from stdin
        → Starts HTTP server on ephemeral port
        → Opens browser to the UI
        → Blocks until user approves/denies
        → Writes hook response JSON to stdout

OpenCode path:
  Agent calls submit_plan tool
    → opencode/index.js             (OpenCode plugin entry, loaded via package.json "main")
      → opencode/bridge.js          (constructs fake HookEvent, spawns binary)
        → bin/open-plan-annotator.mjs → binary (same as above)
      → Parses HookOutput, returns approval/feedback to agent
```

The OpenCode plugin bridges to the same binary by constructing a Claude-format `HookEvent` payload and parsing the `HookOutput` response. This means there is only one server/UI codepath.

### Key Files

- `bin/open-plan-annotator.mjs` — npm bin wrapper. Buffers stdin, resolves the installed platform runtime package, delegates to the binary, and exposes `doctor`.
- `shared/runtimeResolver.mjs` — Maps platform/arch to the correct runtime package and resolves its binary path.
- `server/index.ts` — Main entry. Parses hook event, manages plan history, starts Bun HTTP server, outputs hook response.
- `server/api.ts` — Routes: `GET /api/plan`, `POST /api/approve`, `POST /api/deny`, `POST /api/settings`, and catch-all serving the embedded HTML.
- `server/launch.ts` — Cross-platform `open` / `xdg-open` browser launcher.
- `server/types.ts` — Shared types (`HookEvent`, `HookOutput`, `Annotation`, `ServerState`, `ServerDecision`, `UserPreferences`).
- `opencode/index.js` — OpenCode plugin entry point. Registers `submit_plan` tool, injects system prompt instructions, handles implementation agent handoff.
- `opencode/bridge.js` — Spawns the binary with a fake HookEvent, parses the HookOutput response.
- `opencode/config.js` — Reads `open-plan-annotator.json` config for implementation handoff settings.
- `ui/` — React + Vite frontend, built to a single `build/index.html` embedded at compile time.
- `hooks/hooks.json` — Claude Code hook registration.
- `CLAUDE.plugin.md` — Instructions shipped to end users (copied to `CLAUDE.md` during `npm pack` via prepack/postpack).

## Critical Rules

- **stdout is reserved for Claude Code.** The JSON hook response is the ONLY thing that may be written to stdout. All logs, progress, and diagnostics MUST go to stderr (`console.error`, `process.stderr.write`).
- **`CLAUDE.plugin.md` is user-facing.** It tells Claude to use plan mode. Keep developer-only content in this file (`CLAUDE.md`), not in `CLAUDE.plugin.md`.
- **The binaries are not committed.** Runtime package binaries under `packages/runtime-*/bin/` are generated during build and ignored by git.
- **The OpenCode plugin uses plain JS (not TypeScript).** The `opencode/` directory ships as-is in the npm package — no build step. Keep it as `.js` files with JSDoc types.
- **Never use 'as any'** Always use the correct type.
- **We use bun** not pnpm, npm or yarn in this project.
- **Always double check your work** before telling me you're done by running the
  typecheck, lint, and test scripts.

## Development

```sh
bun run dev            # Server (port 3847) + Vite UI (port 5173)
bun run dev:server     # Server only (NODE_ENV=development, uses DEV_PLAN)
bun run dev:ui         # Vite dev server only
```

In dev mode, `server/index.ts` uses a hardcoded `DEV_PLAN` and skips stdin parsing. The UI proxies API calls to port 3847.

## Build & Release

```sh
bun run build          # Build UI + cross-compile binaries into packages/runtime-*/bin/
bun run release        # Alias for build
./scripts/release.sh   # Full release: bump versions, build, git tag, and publish runtime + main npm packages
```

Cross-compilation targets: `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`.

## Linting

Uses Biome for linting and formatting.

```sh
bun run lint           # Check
bun run lint:fix       # Auto-fix
bun run format         # Format
```

## Hook Protocol

Claude Code sends a `HookEvent` JSON on stdin with `tool_input.plan` containing the plan markdown. The binary responds on stdout with a `HookOutput` JSON:

- Approve: `{ hookSpecificOutput: { hookEventName: "PermissionRequest", decision: { behavior: "allow" } } }`
- Deny: `{ hookSpecificOutput: { hookEventName: "PermissionRequest", decision: { behavior: "deny", message: "..." } } }`
