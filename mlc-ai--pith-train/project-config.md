# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (Claude Code and other assistants) when working with code in this repository. It is the canonical, vendor-neutral instruction file; `CLAUDE.md` simply imports it via `@AGENTS.md`.

## Project Overview

**PithTrain** (package name: `pithtrain`) — a lightweight training framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models. The core innovation is **DualPipeV**, an overlapped forward-backward pipeline parallelism technique. Requires Hopper (SM90) or Blackwell (SM100) GPUs. Python >= 3.12.

## Setup

```bash
uv venv && uv sync
```

## Common Commands

### Linting & Formatting (Ruff)

```bash
ruff check --fix pithtrain/          # lint with auto-fix
ruff format pithtrain/               # format
pre-commit run --all-files       # run all pre-commit hooks
```

Style: 100-char line length, double quotes, `py312` target. Rules: E, F, I, W (ignoring E501, E731). First-party import: `pithtrain`.

### Testing (pytest)

```bash
# Single-GPU unit tests (kernels, ops, layer protocol)
pytest tests/test_fp8_quantize_kernels.py -v
pytest tests/test_deepgemm_fp8_linear_correctness.py -v
pytest tests/test_grouped_linear_correctness.py -v
pytest tests/test_ep_dedup_dispatch.py -v
pytest tests/test_silu_mul.py tests/test_clamped_swiglu.py tests/test_indexed_bias_add.py -v
pytest tests/operators/test_ring_attention.py -v

# Single test function
pytest tests/test_fp8_quantize_kernels.py::test_name -v

# Multi-GPU integration test — boots DualPipeV with FSDP, ~4 GPUs, pp=2 ep=2
bash tests/test_dualpipev.sh
```

### Benchmarks

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.operators.fp8.test_deepgemm
# ring attention: multi-GPU launcher (torchrun), scenario = <model>-cp<N>-s<N>k
bash benchmarks/operators/bench_ring_attention.sh qwen3-30b-a3b-cp4-s32k
```

### Training & Data Prep

The `examples/` tree drives end-to-end workflows; each subdir has a `launch.sh` that auto-detects single-node vs. SLURM and forwards to a `<config>/script.py`.

```bash
# Tokenize a pretraining corpus (per-tokenizer; rerun when switching models)
bash examples/tokenize_corpus/launch.sh dclm-qwen3

# Pretrain (qwen3-30b-a3b | deepseek-v2-lite | gpt-oss-20b | gpt-oss-120b)
bash examples/pretrain_lm/launch.sh qwen3-30b-a3b

# Convert a training checkpoint to / from HuggingFace
bash examples/convert_checkpoint/launch.sh qwen3-30b-a3b
```

### Memory Estimation

```bash
python -m tools.memory_estimator --help   # peak-memory simulator for a given parallelism mesh
```

## Architecture

### DualPipeV Pipeline (`pithtrain/dualpipe/`)

The core pipeline assigns each rank two model chunks in a V-shape (the model is cut into `2 * pp_size` chunks; rank `r` holds chunks `r` and `2*pp_size-1-r`) and overlaps forward and backward execution across micro-batches. Each transformer layer is split into 5 stages:

1. **Attention** — LayerNorm + Attention + LayerNorm + Expert routing
2. **Dispatch** — All-to-all send tokens to assigned experts (async on comm stream)
3. **MLP** — Expert/MLP computation
4. **Combine** — All-to-all gather expert outputs (async on comm stream)
5. **Aggregate** — Weighted expert output + residual connection

Stages 1, 3, and 5 are the layer's compute entry points — `forward_stage1`, `forward_stage3`, `forward_stage5` on `LayerProtocol` (`pithtrain/models/interface.py`); stages 2 and 4 are all-to-all communication driven by the execution machinery (`pithtrain/dualpipe/execution.py`), not layer methods.

Key files:
- `dualpipev.py` — Main scheduler: `DualPipeV.step()` orchestrates overlapped F/B across modules (supports `forward_only=True` for inference), plus `layer_partition()`, which distributes decoder layers across pipeline stages — edge stages (which hold `embed_tokens` / `norm`+`lm_head`) get fewer layers to balance memory.
- `overlap.py` — `overlapped_forward_backward()` interleaved loop for one pair of micro-batches
- `execution.py` — Stage implementations (`stage1_f`, `stage1_b`, etc.), `ExecutionCtx`, and the dispatch/combine helpers
- `comm.py` — P2P communication setup between pipeline ranks
- `utils.py` — `FP8WeightCacheControl` (cache quantized weights across micro-batches), `WeightGradStore` (deferred wgrad for zero-bubble scheduling)

### FP8 Training

`TrainingCfg.fp8` selects the linear-layer backend: at training setup it binds `training.Linear` / `training.GroupedLinear` to the FP8 or BF16 classes. The DeepGEMM path (`pithtrain/operators/linear.py`) uses 128-element block scaling with E8M0 scale format, backed by custom Triton quantization kernels in `pithtrain/operators/deepgemm_quantize.py`. The BF16 grouped linear layer is in `pithtrain/operators/grouped_linear.py`.

### Distributed Parallelism (`pithtrain/modules/distributed.py`)
