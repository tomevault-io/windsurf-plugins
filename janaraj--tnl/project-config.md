Guidance for Claude Code sessions in this repository.

## About this project

This repository is the **TNL (Typed Natural Language) tool itself**: a CLI, an MCP server, and a layered verifier. TNL is a structured English contract format for describing features in agent-written codebases. See [README.md](./README.md) for the stack and layout.

The repository is **dogfooded**: every feature of the TNL tool is described in a `tnl/*.tnl` file, reviewed, approved, and only then implemented. This directory's [`tnl/`](./tnl/) contains self-referential contracts governing the tool's own development.

## Important note on tooling state

The `tnl` CLI, MCP server, and verifier are **being built** in this repository. They do not yet exist as runnable tools. Do not invoke `tnl init`, `tnl verify`, or any other `tnl` subcommand during sessions — they will not work. The TNL workflow is enforced through this `CLAUDE.md` + [`tnl/workflow.tnl`](./tnl/workflow.tnl) for now; tooling replaces the manual flow as each phase lands.

## This repository uses TNL

TNL is the structured English contract format described below and in [`tnl/workflow.tnl`](./tnl/workflow.tnl). For every new feature, the agent writes a TNL file **before** implementing code, the user reviews and approves the TNL, and the agent then implements against the approved TNL.

TNL files live in [`tnl/`](./tnl/). The top-level workflow principles live in [`tnl/workflow.tnl`](./tnl/workflow.tnl) and apply to every session.

### Session start — always do this

1. **Read [`tnl/workflow.tnl`](./tnl/workflow.tnl) first.** Its clauses apply to every session, regardless of the task. Treat them as baseline MUSTs.
2. **Read any `tnl/*.tnl` file whose `paths:` or `surfaces:` overlap with the code you're about to touch.** These are feature contracts, and their clauses are ground-truth for that surface.
3. Treat the contents as part of your operating context. Implementation MUST satisfy every MUST clause; SHOULD clauses are strong preferences; `[semantic]` clauses require judgment to verify — confirm explicitly when they're satisfied.

### Task flow — new features and edits

Every task runs through the same flow, whether the request is for a new feature or a change to existing behavior.

1. **Scope the task.** Scan `tnl/` for files whose `paths:` or `surfaces:` overlap with the request.
   - If the task modifies behavior already described by an existing TNL, the output is an **edit** to that file.
   - If the task introduces a genuinely new behavioral surface, the output is a **new TNL file**.
   - Property changes to existing surfaces (new validation rule, changed semantics, tightened constraints, new inputs or outputs on existing routes) are **edits**, not new files.
2. **Clarify before proposing.** If the request admits multiple reasonable interpretations, ask targeted clarifying questions first. Do not silently pick one and proceed. (See `workflow.tnl`.)
3. **Propose the TNL diff.** For edits, show the changed clauses against the existing file. For new features, propose the full new TNL. Keep it concrete: real file paths, named function signatures where sensible, edge cases as MUST clauses, explicit non-goals.
4. **Wait for user approval** before writing any code.
5. **Apply the approved TNL.**
   - *Edits:* update the existing `tnl/<slug>.tnl` in place.
   - *New features:* save to `tnl/<new-slug>.tnl` (kebab-case, matching the `id:` field).
   - If an edit to one TNL affects clauses referenced in another TNL, update the related file(s) in the same proposal.
6. **Implement from the TNL.** Every MUST clause must be satisfied by specific code or tests. Paths in the machine zone are the scope fence — do not modify files outside them unless the user explicitly agrees.
7. **Self-attest at end of task.** Report which MUST clauses are satisfied and where (file/line/test name). Flag any that could not be satisfied and why. (See `workflow.tnl` clause on exhaustive self-attestation.)

### When a new TNL file is justified

Only for:

- A genuinely new behavioral surface (new CLI subcommand, new MCP tool, new subsystem)
- A cross-cutting policy that spans multiple existing TNLs (the model: `workflow.tnl`)
- A feature with a clear boundary not already covered by any existing TNL

Any other change — modifying inputs, outputs, semantics, validation, constraints, or identity rules of an existing surface — is an edit to the existing file. Do not create a new TNL to patch an existing one.

### TNL format

```
id: <kebab-case-slug>         # matches filename, lowercase, hyphenated
title: <short human-readable>
scope: repo-wide | feature    # repo-wide applies always; feature applies when paths match
owners: [@<handle>]
paths: [<file paths>]         # omit for scope: repo-wide
surfaces: [<CLI cmds, MCP tools, events>]  # optional — named external surfaces
dependencies: [<other tnl ids>]            # optional — other TNL units this couples with

intent:
  One-paragraph plain-English description of what this unit is for.

behaviors:
  - The system MUST <specific, testable behavior>.
  - When <condition>, the system MUST <response>.
  - [semantic] The system MUST <invariant that needs judgment to verify>.
  - The system SHOULD <strong preference, non-blocking>.
