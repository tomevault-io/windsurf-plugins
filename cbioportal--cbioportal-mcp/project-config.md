## Fix Hierarchy

When an LLM agent produces incorrect results, fix the issue at the **root cause level**. The hierarchy is:

### 1. Fix in the Data (Highest Priority)
If the database schema itself causes confusion, modify the schema:
- **Remove confusing columns** that agents misuse
- **Add column comments** to clarify semantics
- **Rename ambiguous columns** if possible

SQL scripts in `sql/` directory (numeric prefix = apply order; see `sql/README.md`):
- `0-cleanup-for-llm.sql` - Removes confusing columns/tables
- `1-add-column-comments.sql` - Adds helpful column comments
- `2-add-oncotree-fields.sql` - Denormalizes OncoTree onto `type_of_cancer`
- `3-add-cancer-study-query-preferences.sql` - Creates the cohort-lookup table
- `4-mutation-frequency-views.sql` - WES-aware views for mutation-frequency denominators + parameterized `gene_mutation_frequency_by_cancer_type(preference, gene)` recipe view + `top_mutated_genes_in_cohort`
- `5-gene-expression-views.sql` - Expression / copy-number-value / methylation views (`gene_pair_coexpression`); backed by `genetic_alteration_derived`
- `portal-specific/<portal-name>/*.sql` - Deployment-specific cohorts (e.g. `portal-specific/public-portal/0-preferences.sql`). Existence-gated so they're no-ops on other deployments.

**Example**: The `sample.sample_type` column contained "Primary Solid Tumor" for ALL samples, causing agents to report wrong counts for "primary samples". Solution: Remove the column entirely.

### 2. Fix in the System Prompt (Medium Priority)
If data can't be changed, add explicit guidance to the agent's system prompt:
- Add warnings about specific columns to avoid
- Include example queries for common patterns
- Reference exact expected values

**Example**: Added explicit warning to prompts.py about not using `sample.sample_type` and showing correct query using `clinical_data_derived`.

### 3. Fix in MCP Resources/Guides (Lower Priority)
Add documentation in study guides and pitfall guides:
- Update `common-pitfalls.md` with new error patterns
- Update study guides with study-specific caveats
- Add example queries that demonstrate correct approach

**Example**: Added pitfall 5b to `common-pitfalls.md` documenting the sample type filtering error.

### Why This Order?

| Level | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| Data | Eliminates error source entirely | Requires DB access, affects all users |
| Prompt | Always available to agent | Uses context tokens, must be maintained |
| Guide | Detailed documentation | Agent must read it, may be ignored |

**Rule**: If you can prevent an error by removing the confusing element, that's better than documenting how to avoid it.

## Context Efficiency

MCP interactions should minimize token usage. Every tool call and resource read consumes context.

### Design Principles

1. **Tools should return minimal, structured data**
   - Return only what's needed to answer the question
   - Use LIMIT in queries
   - Avoid returning large text blobs

2. **Resources are for reference, not bulk data**
   - Study guides explain *what data means*, not *what the data is*
   - General guides explain *how to query*, not query results
   - Never put dynamic data (counts, frequencies) in static resources

3. **Let the agent query, don't prefetch**
   - Don't include "top 10 genes" in study guides — agent can query
   - Don't include sample counts — agent can query
   - Include *how to interpret* results, not the results themselves

### Tool Design

**Good tool:**
```python
def get_study_info(study_id: str) -> dict:
    """Returns basic study metadata (name, cancer type, description)."""
    # Small, focused response
```

**Bad tool:**
```python
def get_study_everything(study_id: str) -> dict:
    """Returns all study data including samples, mutations, clinical data..."""
    # Too much data, wastes context
```

### Resource Design

**Good resource content:**
```markdown
## MSI_STATUS Attribute
- **MSI-H**: Microsatellite instability high (>30% unstable loci)
- **MSI-L**: Low instability
- **MSS**: Microsatellite stable

Use MSI status to predict immunotherapy response.
```

**Bad resource content:**
```markdown
## MSI Status Distribution
- MSI-H: 1,234 samples (15%)
- MSI-L: 456 samples (6%)
- MSS: 6,789 samples (79%)
```
(Numbers change; agent should query for current counts)

### When to Use What

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| How to calculate mutation frequency | General guide (mutation-frequency-guide.md) |
| What clinical attributes mean in a study | Study guide (study-guides/xxx.md) |
| Actual mutation counts | Tool: clickhouse_run_select_query |
| List of studies | Tool: list_studies |
| Study-specific attribute semantics | Tool: get_study_guide → loads resource |

### Caching Strategy

- Study guides are static files → can be cached
- Query results are dynamic → don't cache in resources
- General guides rarely change → good to preload in agent instructions
