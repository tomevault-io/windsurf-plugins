Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

`numpyro_forecast` is a JAX/NumPyro port of Pyro's `pyro.contrib.forecast`
module. The design context lives in the module docstrings (`forecaster.py`,
`evaluate.py`, `util.py`) and the example notebooks under `examples/` — read the
relevant ones before making non-trivial changes.

## Conventions

- **Array layout:** time at axis `-2`, observation/event dim at `-1`, batch dims
  to the left (matches Pyro).
- **Train vs forecast:** a single model handles both. In-sample time latents use
  a fixed site name (`drift`); the forecast horizon uses a separate `_future`
  site so `AutoNormal` never resizes and `Predictive` draws the suffix from the
  prior. The horizon is derived from shapes (`covariates` longer than `data`).
- **Functional style:** pure model functions, explicit `PRNGKey` threading,
  `jax.lax.scan` for latent levels, no global parameter store.
- **`rng_key` first:** every JAX/NumPyro function that consumes randomness takes `rng_key: Array` as its first parameter (first after `self` for methods), required and positional (not keyword-only). The one exception is `functools.singledispatch` generics, which must dispatch on their type argument: keep the dispatched generic private (dispatching on its type arg) and expose a thin public wrapper with `rng_key` first (see `draw_posterior` / `_draw_posterior_impl` in `functional.py`).
- **Integer literals:** write integers with four or more digits using underscore separators so zeros are easy to count: `1_000`, `10_000`, `1_234_567_890` (not `1000`, `1234567890`).

## Hard requirements

- Every function (public and private) has complete input and return type hints,
  checked with `ty`.
- Every public function/class has a NumPy-style docstring (ruff `D`/`DOC`).
- **jaxtyping:** annotate array shapes as `Float[Array, " time obs"]` with a
  **leading space** in the shape string (per the jaxtyping FAQ this turns ruff's
  `F821` into `F722`, which we ignore globally; `F821` stays active otherwise).
  Do **not** use `from __future__ import annotations` (incompatible with runtime
  type checking).

## Tests

For the tests, we use `pytest`.

## Docstrings

We use Numpy-like docstrings: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

## Writing

### No em-dashes

Do not use em-dashes (`—`) in any prose. Use the most natural alternative for the grammatical role the dash was playing: a colon for an explanation or expansion, a comma (or pair of commas) for a parenthetical aside, parentheses for a softer aside, a semicolon for a closely-related independent clause, or a full stop to start a new sentence. Pick the form that reads most cleanly; do not just substitute one punctuation mark mechanically for another.

### No hard line breaks in prose

When writing text files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.qmd`, and similar), do **not** wrap prose at a fixed column. Write each paragraph as a single long line and let the editor/renderer handle visual wrapping.

- Yes: one line per paragraph, one line per bullet.
- No: inserting newlines every 80 (or 100, or any other) characters inside a paragraph.

Exceptions: code blocks, tables, YAML front matter, and anything where the newline is semantically meaningful (e.g. markdown lists, mermaid diagrams) — keep those formatted normally.

### American English spelling

Use American English spelling. Do not use British English spelling.

## Commands

See the Makefile for the full workflow.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras
# Run pre-commit hooks
prek run --all-files
# Lint and format
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
# Type check
uv run ty check numpyro_forecast/
# Run tests
uv run pytest
```
