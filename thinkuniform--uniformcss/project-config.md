description: How to add or edit a UniformCSS utility
---


# Utility files are declarative config, not CSS

Each utility file defines a single utility as a config map and registers it
into the shared registry. It must NOT emit any CSS itself — the engine in
`uniform/_index.scss` reads the registry and generates everything.

## Required shape

```scss
@use "uniform/core";
@use "sass:map";

$config: (
  utilities: (
    align-content: (
      important: false,
      shorthand: align-content,   // class prefix; null = use variant key alone
      responsive: true,
      responsive-pseudos: false,
      extra-selector: null,
      properties: (align-content),
      static-properties: (),      // always-emitted props (e.g. CSS vars)
      variants: ( center: center, start: flex-start ),
      pseudos: (none)             // or e.g. (hover, group-hover, focus)
    )
  )
);

// Always register via this exact line — shallow merge into the registry.
core.$utilities: map.merge(core.$utilities, map.get($config, utilities));
```

- Do NOT use `map.deep-merge(core.$all-config, $config)` (the old, quadratic pattern).
- Utility names are unique top-level keys, so a shallow `map.merge` is correct.
- After adding a utility, also `@use` it in `uniform/_index.scss`.
