# Design MD Generator

You have access to a design system extraction tool. When the user asks you to match a website's visual style, build UI that looks like a specific site, or create a DESIGN.md:

**Run the full pipeline without stopping.** Do not ask "should I proceed?" between steps.

## Full Pipeline (one command flow)

```bash
# 1. Extract design tokens
pnpm engine:extract <URL>

# 2. [YOU] Read tokens.json + screenshots, write DESIGN.md following SKILL.md spec
#    Write all 14 core sections without pausing. Self-audit. Fix issues.

# 3. Validate
pnpm engine:validate output/<domain>/DESIGN.md output/<domain>/tokens.json

# 4. Generate report + proof
pnpm engine:preview output/<domain>/tokens.json output/<domain>/
pnpm engine:proof <URL> output/<domain>/tokens.json output/<domain>/
pnpm engine:report output/<domain>/tokens.json output/<domain>/ output/<domain>/DESIGN.md

# 5. Open report for user
open output/<domain>/report.html
```

## Using an Existing DESIGN.md

If a DESIGN.md already exists in the project:

1. Read it completely before writing any UI code
2. Use ONLY the colors, fonts, sizes, and shadows specified in it
3. Do NOT invent values not present in the document
4. Follow Section 13 (Agent Prompt Guide) for quick reference

## Critical Rules

- ALL numerical values MUST come from tokens.json never hallucinate
- 6-digit lowercase hex (#ffffff, not #FFF)
- Numeric font weights (400, 700) not words (bold)
- Do not stop between steps to ask for confirmation
- Present only the final result

## Full Specification

See SKILL.md for the complete 21-step workflow, format spec, writing style guide, and quality checklist.

## Local environment notes (this codebase only not upstream)

### Next.js 16 breaking changes

This codebase runs Next.js 16. APIs, conventions, and file structure may differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code in `app/` or `components/`. Heed deprecation notices.

### File layout differences from upstream

- Engine modules live at `lib/engine/*.ts` (upstream: `scripts/*.ts`)
- CLI entry points are split into `bin/*.ts` thin wrappers
- pnpm replaces npm (`pnpm engine:extract` not `npx ts-node scripts/extract.ts`)
- See [MIRROR.md](./MIRROR.md) for the full divergence map and rebase procedure
