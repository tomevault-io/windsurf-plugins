# AGENT.md - Developer & AI Instructions for CubeTimer (v1.2.1)

This document provides essential context and coding standards for AI agents (Gemini, Claude, etc.) working on this repository.

## 🆕 v1.2.1: Penalty Logic & Interaction Fixes
- **DNF & +2 Penalty**: Support for marking the most recent record as DNF or applying a +2s penalty via UI buttons.
- **Sync Logic**: Penalty toggles must use functional state updates in `App.tsx` and sync with `localStorage` via `updateRecord`.
- **Anti-Misclick Interaction**: 
  - The main timer container is for display only.
  - Interaction is restricted to the **Action Pad** button below the time.
  - No keyboard shortcuts for penalties (to prevent accidental triggers).
- **Naming Convention**: Use **"START"** instead of "Reset" for starting a new solve session.

## 🆕 v1.2.0: Touch & Mobile Support
- **Dual-Trigger Logic**: Supports both Spacebar (Keyboard) and Pointer (Touch/Click) via the Action Pad.
- **Pointer Events**: Use `onPointerDown` and `onPointerUp` for timing control.
- **CSS**: `touch-none` and `select-none` are applied to the timer to prevent gesture interference.

## ⏱️ Precision & Timing Logic (CRITICAL)
- **Standard**: All timing must be at **0.001s (millisecond)** precision.
- **High-Res Clock**: Use `performance.now()` for all elapsed time calculations.
- **Format**: 
  - Under 60s: `S.SSS`
  - Over 60s: `M:SS.SSS`

## 🏗️ Architecture & Patterns
- **Component Reset**: When changing `puzzleType`, always use `key={puzzleType}` on the `Timer` component in `App.tsx` to force a complete state reset.
- **Refs for State**: Use `useRef` for high-frequency values (start times, intervals) in `Timer.tsx` to avoid stale closures.
- **UI Language**: Always English for all labels, buttons, and user-facing messages.
- **Theming**: Strict dark mode using `bg-gray-900` as the primary background.

## 📂 Key File Map
- `src/app/App.tsx`: Main entry, puzzle state management, high-level UI.
- `src/app/components/Timer.tsx`: Timing engine with **Action Pad** control.
- `src/app/utils/storage.ts`: Persistence layer (localStorage).

## 🤖 AI Maintenance Rules (MANDATORY)
1. **Sync Documentation**: After implementing any major feature or version bump, you **MUST** update both `AGENT.md` and `README.md`.
2. **Version Alignment**: Ensure the version string in `src/app/App.tsx`, `README.md`, and `AGENT.md` are always aligned.
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Only modify `AGENT.md`; the Git pre-commit hook handles syncing.
