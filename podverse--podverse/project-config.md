# Nix Terminal Wrapper (Agent Sandbox)

This repo uses a Nix flake for Node/npm and other tools. There is no global Node on the system path in environments where the agent runs.

For any terminal command that needs `node`, `npm`, `npx`, or other tools provided by the flake (e.g. make, kubectl), run it via the project wrapper from repo root:

```bash
./scripts/nix/with-env <command> [args...]
```

Examples:

- `./scripts/nix/with-env npm run build:packages`
- `./scripts/nix/with-env npm run lint`
- `./scripts/nix/with-env npm run dev:api`
- `./scripts/nix/with-env npx some-package`

Run from the repository root. The wrapper resolves the flake path so it also works when the shell's cwd is a subdirectory.

In automated or agent runs (e.g. Cursor's agent), the sandbox may block Nix's cache under `~/.cache/nix`. When invoking this wrapper from the agent, request full permissions (e.g. `all`) so Nix can write to its cache and the command can succeed.
