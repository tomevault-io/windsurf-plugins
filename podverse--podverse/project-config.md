# Maestro ADB port reservation

Reserve localhost TCP ports **5555–5683** for Android emulator ADB endpoints.

Maestro's `dadb` device discovery probes this conventional emulator range, including when a run
targets iOS. An unrelated host service that accepts a connection in this range can make Maestro
wait indefinitely for an ADB handshake.

- Do not publish local services on host ports `5555–5683`.
- Local Artemis uses host port `5684` and container port `5672`.
- Container-only and Kubernetes service ports may remain `5672`; the reservation applies to host
  port mappings.
- Keep the mobile E2E runner's valid-ADB-handshake guard enabled as a diagnostic backstop.
- Do not attempt to solve this by changing the emulator port range; Maestro's direct-discovery
  range is not a supported flow-level setting.
