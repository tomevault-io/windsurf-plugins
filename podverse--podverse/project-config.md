# Test Timeout Budget

Default test timeouts must stay at **10 seconds or less**. Longer waits waste operator time and hide real failures.

## Playwright E2E

- **Config default:** `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` and `apps/management-web/playwright.config.ts` use `timeout: 10_000`.
- **Do not** add `test.setTimeout(...)` above 10s in specs unless a specific test genuinely needs it.
- **Do not** set per-assertion `timeout:` (e.g. `toBeVisible({ timeout: 15_000 })`) above the test budget.
- When a one-off exception is required, add a short inline comment explaining why (e.g. cold-start seed, known slow CI step).

## Unit / integration (Vitest)

- Prefer fast, deterministic tests. Do not add long `vi.waitFor` / polling loops to paper over flakiness.
- Fix root causes (missing polyfills, unstable assets, remount churn) instead of raising timeouts.

## When tests fail at 10s

1. **Diagnose** whether the failure is slowness or instability (detached DOM, remount loops, bad fixtures).
2. **Fix the cause** (polyfill, narrower E2E scope, stable seed asset, unit-test the interaction).
3. **Raise timeout only** when the step is legitimately slow and stable — document it as a one-off in that test.

## Examples

```typescript
// BAD — blanket override hides problems
test.beforeEach(async () => {
  test.setTimeout(45_000);
});

// BAD — assertion timeout exceeds test budget
await expect(portal).toBeVisible({ timeout: 15_000 });

// GOOD — rely on config default (10s)
await expect(portal).toBeVisible();

// OK — rare one-off with justification
test('cold-start integration smoke', async () => {
  test.setTimeout(20_000); // first-run webpack compile on CI only
  // ...
});
```
