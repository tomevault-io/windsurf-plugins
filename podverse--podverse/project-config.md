description: User vocabulary abcmemory and abcremember for Cursor guidance files

# abcmemory / abcremember vocabulary

## abcmemory

**abcmemory** means the committed files Cursor uses for agent guidance in this repo — **only** under `.cursor/` and the repo root files Cursor reads:

- `.cursor/skills/**`
- `.cursor/rules/**`
- `.cursor/prompts/**`
- `.cursor/hooks/**` and `.cursor/hooks.json` (when present)
- `.cursorrules`
- `.cursorignore`

## Not abcmemory

**`.llm/`** (plans, history, templates, context) is a **planning workspace**, not agent memory. Do not treat it as a second abcmemory tree.

Also not abcmemory unless you explicitly ask: `docs/`, `.github/`, and ad-hoc paths.

## abcremember

When the user says **abcremember**, **create or update** the best-fit abcmemory file(s) under **`.cursor/`** (or `.cursorrules` / `.cursorignore`): prefer updating existing guidance when the instruction extends the same topic; create a new skill, rule, or prompt only when no suitable file exists. Then follow that guidance in future work. Do **not** write to `.llm/` unless they explicitly say to remember something there.

For placement and workflow details, see `.cursor/skills/abcmemory/SKILL.md`.

## abcchecke2e

When the user says **abcchecke2e**, inspect both staged and unstaged changes, including
untracked files that are part of the current work. Compare those changes with
`docs/testing/E2E-VERIFICATION-SCRATCHPAD.md`.

- Update the scratchpad so it lists the focused E2E verification required by the current changes.
- Remove scratchpad entries that are unrelated to the current staged and unstaged changes.
- Preserve only commands and report-review paths that are actionable for the current work.
- Do not treat the scratchpad as permanent feature documentation; it represents the current
  working-tree verification state.

## legacy app

**legacy app** (also **podverse-rn**, **v4 mobile**) means the React Native app in the sibling
checkout **`../podverse-rn`** relative to this monorepo root (typically
`/Users/mitcheldowney/repos/pv/podverse-rn`).

**Nextgen** / **this monorepo** (`podverse`) is the current product codebase, including
`apps/mobile`.

See **legacy-app-reference** for when and how to open that checkout.
