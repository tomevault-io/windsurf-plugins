# Mobile — fast startup and orchestrated sync

Startup speed is a product requirement, not a performance nicety. The app must reach an interactive
screen as fast as is feasible, and **everything else catches up afterwards, visibly**.

## Nothing network-bound blocks first paint

The first screen renders from local storage. A network call may **never** sit between app launch and
an interactive UI — not to resolve auth, not to refresh the account, not to hydrate a list.

- Render the cached account, the cached subscriptions, and the cached queue immediately.
- Anything that needs the network is enqueued as a sync job and runs after the app is usable.
- A slow or absent network changes only how *stale* the first screen is, never how *fast* it appears.

## Background sync is serial, foreground actions are not

There are two lanes, and confusing them is the main way this design fails.

| Lane            | What                                                                 | Concurrency        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Sync queue**  | Background reconciliation: account refresh, subscriptions, items, RSS re-parse, projections | **One at a time**  |
| **Interactive** | Anything a user is waiting on: tapping Subscribe, opening a screen, playback, search | Immediate, unqueued |

Serialize the sync queue so background work cannot saturate the network or the JS thread and make
the app feel slow. Do **not** put interactive work in the queue — a user who taps Subscribe must not
wait behind a full library sync. When in doubt: if a human is watching a spinner they triggered, it
is interactive.

Auth token refresh (`refreshAccessTokenSingleFlight`) stays orthogonal to the queue. It is a
prerequisite of individual requests in both lanes, not a sync job.

## Subscribed content is read from the device

Every screen that browses, filters, or sorts **subscribed** content reads local storage and nothing
else, so it behaves the same with no connection. Channels come from `subscriptionsRepository`,
their episodes from `channelItemsRepository`, and add-by-RSS feeds from `addByRssRepository`.

- A screen that reads subscribed content from the network is a bug, even when the network is up.
- Network search and directory browse are separate, online-only surfaces and do not read this store.
- The one-time fallback for a screen with nothing stored yet is acceptable; a fallback that runs
  whenever the network happens to be available is not, because it hides the offline path breaking.
- Refreshing a screen the user just opened runs directly rather than through the queue. Queued work
  is for passes nobody asked for.

## Every queued job is visible

While the queue is non-empty, a sync indicator bar reports **what** is syncing and **how many steps
remain**, and it disappears when the queue drains. Sync the user cannot see is sync the user
experiences as an unexplained slowdown.

- The bar sits directly above the mini player, and directly above the tab bar when the mini player
  is hidden.
- A new kind of sync work ships with its queue registration and its label in the same change. Adding
  a background fetch that bypasses the queue leaves a gap in the indicator.
- User-invoked work that has its own local spinner (pull-to-refresh, OPML import) also reports to the
  bar. The local control keeps its own feedback; the bar remains the one place that answers "what is
  the app doing".

## Failures are quiet on screen and durable in the log

A failed job does not turn the bar red. The queue skips it, finishes the run, and the bar
disappears; the next trigger retries. An offline user is doing nothing wrong and must not be
scolded.

Failures are instead appended to a **capped sync event log** (500 entries) that the user can reach
from More, so a support conversation has something concrete in it.

**Recorded messages must embed the machine-readable error code.** The displayed message is
localized, so the code is the only part a user can usefully quote to support. A log entry with a
translated sentence and no code is not diagnosable.
