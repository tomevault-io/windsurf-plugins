# CarPlay / Android Auto native cache contract

Audio and car browse/play must work when the **JS runtime is suspended or the phone app is closed**.
That requires native platform services — not JavaScript-owned playback or car menus.

## Architecture constraints

- **Car browse trees are native-only.** iOS: CarPlay `CPTemplate` scene (Swift). Android: Media3
  `MediaLibraryService` browse tree — **not** a JS/React Native car UI.
- **Do not** implement car browsing as JS-only navigation or third-party RN car plugins. JS cannot
  run when the app is killed; car menus must read **native** data.
- **Do not use `react-native-track-player`** as the Podverse media engine or car architecture. Use
  first-party **`podverse-media-engine`** (Track 2): single shared **AVPlayer** (iOS) / **ExoPlayer**
  (Media3) instance for phone UI, lock screen, and car now-playing.
- Car now-playing and remote commands bind to that **same engine instance** — not a separate player
  per surface.

## Native cache (JS writes, native reads)

JS syncs a small cache whenever queue, downloads, or library index changes:

| Payload (Track 12)              | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Queue snapshot                  | Now-playing + upcoming for car skip/advance  |
| Downloads index                 | Offline items playable from car              |
| Library browse index            | Podcast/playlist lists for car templates     |

Schema and storage are defined in **Track 12** (master plan step **12.1** —
[380-native-cache-schema](/docs/proposals/mobile/_master-plan_/phase-1/details/380-native-cache-schema.md)).
JS write-path: steps **10.22**, **12.4**; engine hooks: **2.35**, **114-engine-native-cache-hooks**.

Native car services read the cache **without starting JS**. Spikes **12.5–12.6** prove read-with-app-closed.

## Platform services

| Platform | Car / background owner                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS      | CarPlay scene + `AVAudioSession` + `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` |
| Android  | Media3 `MediaLibraryService` foreground service + session  |

Android Auto connects to the **service**, not the Activity. CarPlay templates are driven from **Swift**
reading the cache.

## Android Auto: implemented natively from the cache (12.11–12.15)

The Android Auto browse tree **and** play are implemented in the native media-engine module — never
in JS / `react-native-track-player`:

- **Service + callers (12.11 / 12.13):** `PodverseMediaLibraryService` (Media3 `MediaLibraryService`)
  validates allowed callers in `onConnect` (Media3's signature-checked Auto / Automotive / media
  notification controllers) and serves a stable browsable root **with the app force-stopped**. The
  `com.google.android.gms.car.application` media-app descriptor ships in the module manifest.
- **Browse tree (12.12 / 12.14):** `onGetChildren` projects the durable native cache
  (`PodverseNativeCacheModel` parses `library-browse` + `downloads`) into **Library** + **Downloads**
  nodes. No SQLite; tolerant parsing → empty tree, never crash.
- **Play (12.15):** `onAddMediaItems` / `onPlaybackResumption` resolve a mediaId against the cache and
  play through the **one** shared `PodverseAudioEngine` — offline `file://` first, else remote
  enclosure. Queue/auto-queue policy stays in `@podverse/playback-core`.

When changing car browse/play, edit the **native** module (`android/.../PodverseMediaLibraryService.kt`,
`PodverseNativeCacheModel.kt`) — do **not** add a JS/track-player car browser. Prove changes with the
operator DHU gate:
[ANDROID-AUTO-DHU-CHECKLIST.md](/apps/mobile/modules/podverse-media-engine/ANDROID-AUTO-DHU-CHECKLIST.md).
iOS CarPlay (12.7–12.10) is a later slice pending the Apple CarPlay entitlement.

## LLM do / don't

- **Do** design queue/auto-queue/download **repositories** to call native cache projection writes on
  every mutation (stubs OK until Track 12 storage). SQLite is phone-UI-only — car/watch cannot read
  Drizzle when JS is dead. See
  [DOCS-MOBILE-DATA-LAYER-OFFLINE.md §7.1](/docs/proposals/mobile/initial-decisions/DOCS-MOBILE-DATA-LAYER-OFFLINE.md).
- **Do** keep car native code in `apps/mobile/ios/`, `android/`, `modules/` — parallel worktree OK
  (see **mobile-worktree-scope**).
- **Don't** assume the RN app must be foreground for car playback.
- **Don't** assume CarPlay / Android Auto / watch complications read SQLite.
- **Don't** duplicate queue policy in native — policy stays in `@podverse/playback-core`; native
  executes transport and displays cached state.
