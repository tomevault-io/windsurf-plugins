description: Filter and sort selections persist locally per instance and restore on load, on web and mobile

# Filter and sort selections are remembered

Any screen that lets a user change **filter** or **sort** must remember the last selection and
restore it on the next load, without the user re-applying it. This applies to **both `apps/web` and
`apps/mobile`**, and the behavior must match on the two surfaces.

## Per instance, not per screen type

A user may want one sort for one podcast and a different sort for another. Persistence is keyed by
the **specific instance**, not the route shape.

| Correct                                    | Wrong                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/podcast/abc` and `/podcast/xyz` differ    | One remembered sort shared by all podcast pages    |
| Each episode page keeps its own tab + sort  | One bucket for "episode detail"                    |
| Global lists keyed by list (`podcasts`)     | —                                                  |

Global list routes (`/podcasts`, `/episodes`, `/clips`, …) have exactly one instance, so their list
name **is** the scope. Detail routes must include the channel or item identifier.

## Local to the device, never the server

These preferences are **device-local**. Do not add a column, endpoint, or account-synced field for
them. A user's phone and their laptop may legitimately disagree, and that is fine.

| Surface  | Store                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web`    | The `local-settings` cookie — cookies are readable during SSR |
| `apps/mobile` | AsyncStorage via `src/prefs/` |

**Web uses a cookie rather than `localStorage` on purpose.** Web list and detail pages fetch with a
sort parameter during server rendering, and `localStorage` is invisible to the server. Storing the
pref anywhere the server cannot read produces a default-sorted first paint that visibly re-sorts
after hydration, plus a duplicated request.

### The web store is a bounded LRU

Cookies cap at 4KB and ride along on every same-origin request, so web keeps only the **30 most
recently used** instance entries and evicts least-recently-used beyond that. Mobile has no such
constraint and stores entries unbounded.

The eviction is acceptable because a sort you care about belongs to a podcast you keep returning to,
which keeps it at the top of the LRU. Beyond the window, fall back to the normal default — never to
a stale or arbitrary sort.

**The LRU holds detail instances only.** Global lists live in their own unbounded bucket in the same
cookie, keyed by the same shared builder. There is a fixed, small number of them and a user returns
to them constantly, so putting them in the same window would let ordinary browsing evict the home
page's own sort. A count of entries is also not a size guarantee: trim from the least-recently-used
end until the whole serialized cookie value fits, because a browser that finds the cookie over 4KB
drops all of it rather than one entry.

## What persists and what does not

| Persist                                                   | Do not persist                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Sort selection                                            | **Free-text filter or search input**         |
| Structured filters — type, range, category, media type    | Page number / pagination offset              |
| Tab selection on detail screens                           | Scroll position (separate concern)           |
| View mode (grid / list)                                   | Transient loading or error state             |

**Free text is deliberately excluded.** A restored text filter hides most of the list and reads as
missing data rather than as a remembered preference. Text filters clear on reload and restart.

## URL parameters win, and they update the stored preference

On web, an explicit query parameter is a deliberate act — a shared link, a bookmark, a back
navigation. It takes precedence over the stored preference **and overwrites it** for that instance,
so a subsequent visit to the clean URL keeps what the user just saw.

Resolution order on load:

1. Explicit URL parameter, if present — and write it to the store
2. Stored preference for this instance
3. The screen's documented default

Do **not** write defaults into the URL to make persistence work; that violates
[`routing-url-params`](/.cursor/rules/routing-url-params.mdc). The store holds the preference and the
URL stays clean.

## Shared key derivation

The **scope key builder and the stored value shape** live in `@podverse/helpers` so web and mobile
cannot drift. The **storage** is per-surface (cookie vs AsyncStorage) because mobile may not import
`@podverse/helpers-browser` and web has no AsyncStorage.

Do not invent a second key format in one app. If a new scope is needed, add it to the shared builder.
