description: Shared UI (@podverse/ui) — no embedded user-facing copy; apps localize via next-intl
---


# Shared UI and i18n

## Do

- Keep `packages/ui` **framework-agnostic**: do not import `next-intl` or read app message
  catalogs inside `@podverse/ui`.
- Pass **all** user-visible strings, `aria-label`, `title`, empty states, and loading text
  from the app via props (or `children` / `ReactNode` already produced by the app).
- For multi-string controls, prefer a small typed `labels` object or named string props
  (see `CursorPagination`, `CopyToClipboardButton`).
- When adding new copy-bearing props, add keys to the correct
  `packages/i18n-catalog/{shared,consumer,management}/originals/en-US.json` layer and keep other
  locales in sync via `npm run i18n:all` (see **`i18n-management`** rule).

## Do not

- Do not hardcode English — or any single locale — in shared components as **defaults** for
  text that end users or assistive tech will see. (Internal `throw new Error(...)` for
  developer misuse is fine.)
- Do not add “temporary” English defaults in `@podverse/ui` to save app wiring; wire the app
  instead.

## Review checklist

- Any new string literal in `packages/ui` shown in the UI or read by AT → move to app props.
- Formatting with ICU variables (`{name}`) stays in app `t(...)` calls, not inside `@podverse/ui`.
- **Layout primitives** (Callout, CTA shell, Accordion, etc.) follow the same rule: no baked-in copy; apps pass localized strings.
