# Plan Creation

When creating a plan, if it is too large, **do not implement it immediately**. Instead:

1. Break it into separate files
2. Save those files in the `.llm/plans/active/` directory (or appropriate subdirectory)
3. Wait for the user to prompt you to complete them one-by-one

This ensures plans remain manageable and can be executed incrementally.
