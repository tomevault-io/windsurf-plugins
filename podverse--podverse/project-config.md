# Prefer shared UI (web + management-web)

When adding or changing UI in **web** or **management-web**:

## Order

1. **Check `@podverse/ui` first** — reuse an existing export if it fits (buttons, tables, forms, navigation primitives, spinners, etc.).
2. **If both apps need the same generic behavior** — implement **once** in `packages/ui/src/components/**` (or `packages/ui/src/hooks/**` for shared hooks) and export from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.
3. **App-local components** — only for shell, routing, or product-specific behavior; not for duplicating a primitive that belongs in `@podverse/ui`.

## Style convergence

When **web** and **management-web** already have overlapping patterns (e.g. icon actions, menus):

- **Prefer the existing web app’s visual baseline** (colors, borders, spacing, interaction) in the shared implementation unless there is a documented accessibility or product reason not to.
- **Do not** fork near-duplicate components in each app when one shared primitive can serve both with props (`appearance`, `variant`, etc.).

## Before adding anything new

- Search `packages/ui` and `apps/web/src/components` for an existing pattern to promote or extend.
- See also: **`reusable-components`** skill and **management-web-prefer-shared-ui** (management-specific notes).

## Promotion checklist (touching web or management-web)

1. Search **`packages/ui`** for an existing primitive that fits.
2. If the control is **generic and reusable** → add or extend **`packages/ui`** (do not introduce a parallel app-local copy).
3. Keep the implementation **in the app** only when it hits the **stay-in-app denylist**: Next-only imports (`next/*`), **`next-intl`** wiring, authenticated data fetch in render, product-only routes, or domain-specific modals.

## i18n

- Shared primitives must not embed user-facing copy; apps pass localized strings (see
  **`shared-ui-i18n`** rule).
