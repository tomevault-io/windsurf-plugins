# Build order and docs sync

Use the `build-order` skill (`.cursor/skills/build-order/SKILL.md`) whenever you edit build
orchestration.

## Required

- Preserve dependency-safe staged build execution.
- Keep root `build` aligned with package/app/tool build sequencing.
- Update `docs/development/tooling/DOCS-DEVELOPMENT-TOOLING-BUILD-ORDER.md` when behavior changes.

## Prohibited

- Do not reintroduce all-workspace root build execution that can violate workspace dependency order.
