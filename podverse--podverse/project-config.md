# Mobile feature PRs require E2E flow + screenshots

When a change introduces or modifies user-facing behavior in `apps/mobile/src/**`, include matching
mobile E2E coverage in the same PR — same operator habit as web UI screenshot reports.

## Required for mobile UI behavior changes

- Add or update a Maestro flow under `apps/mobile/e2e/<area>.yaml` that covers the changed behavior.
- Ensure the flow captures screenshots (`takeScreenshot`) for key checkpoints.
- After `launchApp` + `clearState`, enter Metro via `runFlow: shared/connect-dev-client.yaml` before
  asserting app screens (Expo Dev Client launcher is not the app UI).
- Instruct the operator to generate reports (agents do not run E2E during implementation). **End
  the implementation response** with the most focused command (same habit as web screenshot
  reports):
  - `npm run mobile:e2e:test -- <area>` (narrowest flow), plus slot `open` paths
  - Full prelude only when needed: `mobile:dev`, `mobile:e2e:ios`, `mobile:e2e:android`
- Point at per-slot HTML (not a single combined screenshot dump):
  - `.artifacts/mobile-e2e-reports/latest/index.html` (hub)
  - `.artifacts/mobile-e2e-reports/latest/ios-phone/index.html`
  - `.artifacts/mobile-e2e-reports/latest/android-phone/index.html`
  - tablet slots (`ios-tablet`, `android-tablet`) when those devices are in the matrix

## Debug with reports

When diagnosing a mobile E2E failure, **read the failing slot report** (error text + screenshots)
before changing code. See **mobile-e2e-screenshots**.

## Not required

- Pure docs updates with no mobile UI/runtime behavior change.
- Refactors that do not alter user-observable behavior and already have equivalent flow coverage.

## Do not

- Do not use Playwright for mobile E2E.
- Do not use web/management-web `make e2e_*` targets for mobile flows.
