# Mobile settings option density

When a **user-configurable setting** presents a fixed list of choices:

| Option count | Control                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2–3**      | Chip / pill buttons (`OptionChipGroup`) — all choices visible           |
| **4+**       | Settings row → **push** an option-list screen (`OptionListScreen`) — iOS Settings style |

## Do

- Prefer shared components under `apps/mobile/src/components/form/` over per-screen pill grids.
- Pass already-localized labels; keep i18n in the screen / caller.
- Keep binary prefs (on/off) as `Switch`, not chips or list pages.
- For 4+ options, navigate to a dedicated list screen (checkmark on current, Back returns). Do
  **not** use a bottom-sheet modal with a sliding scrim for primary preference pickers.
- On the settings root row (`SettingsOptionNavRow`), stack **label → description → current value +
  chevron** vertically. Do **not** put the current value in a trailing/right column (it squeezes
  the description).

## Don't

- Do not use wrapping pill grids for Theme, Language, or other lists that already have 4+ values
  (or will grow).
- Do not import web `@podverse/ui` dropdowns on mobile.
- Do not use iOS-only `ActionSheetIOS` as the cross-platform select.
- Do not use `OptionSelectSheet` / settings bottom sheets for Theme, Language, or similar prefs
  (sheets remain for contextual actions like media-row More / add-to-playlist).
- Do not place the selected value as `ListRow` `trailing` next to a multi-line description.
