# Cross-surface change impact

A task scoped to one surface is not automatically a change to one surface. Mobile work routinely
requires matching work in `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/orm`, or the shared i18n catalogs — and
the reverse is equally true.

**Before planning or implementing, ask what else has to change.** Do not discover it during review.

## Triggers — assume other surfaces are affected

| Trigger                                   | Who else is affected                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New or changed **API endpoint**           | Every client of that endpoint, plus OpenAPI                              |
| New or changed **ORM entity or column**   | API serialization, DTOs in `@podverse/helpers`, every consumer           |
| Change to a **shared package**            | All dependents — check the dependency graph, not just your app           |
| **Cross-device state** of any kind        | Every device is a client; if one device can change it, all must read it  |
| New **vocabulary** in a shared DTO or API | Renaming a shipped field is a breaking change across all surfaces        |
| Any change to a **persisted DTO**         | Mobile stored it on disk — see `dto-changes-are-device-data-migrations` |
| New user-facing **string**                | Catalog layer choice: `shared` / `consumer` vs mobile-only `mobile`      |
| New **entitlement or gate**               | The gate must agree on every surface, or users see contradictory access  |
| **Feature parity** decisions              | Diverging is fine; diverging *accidentally* is not                       |

## Cross-device state is the sharpest one

If state syncs to an account, every surface that can **change** it must write it, and every surface
that **displays** it must read it. Planning that state on one surface only produces stale or wrong
data on the others. Say explicitly, per surface, whether it reads, writes, both, or neither.

## Check what already exists before proposing it

Before planning a mechanism, search for it. Nextgen frequently already has the pattern — an
account-level last-seen timestamp, a retention column, a purge worker, a shared error parser.
Reusing the existing pattern is right; proposing to "add" something that ships today is a plan
defect.

## Deliberate divergence is allowed, silent divergence is not

Mobile may intentionally differ from web (for example, local subscriptions that work signed out
while web's are account-backed). When that happens, **record it as an intentional divergence** in the
plan, including what web does instead and why the two do not need to match.

## When unsure, ask

If you cannot tell whether web needs a matching change, **ask the operator** rather than assuming
mobile-only scope. Name the specific surface and the specific behavior you are unsure about. This
is a mandatory question trigger, not a judgment call to make quietly.
