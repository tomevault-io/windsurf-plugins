# Comments are future-forward

A comment is for the next person reading this file, who has never seen any earlier version of it.
Write only what is true of the code **as it stands**. The history of how it got here belongs in the
commit message and the PR, which is where someone goes when they actually want it.

## Don't

- Narrate a removal: "no longer produced", "this used to call X", "the old per-screen strings",
  "retained so historical rows still render".
- Explain an absence created by an edit: "No membership-expiry row here", "not offerable as a
  category", "we removed the scheduler".
- Date the code against itself: "now", "currently", "as of this change", "going forward".
- Justify the diff to a reviewer: "changed this because…", "this is the new approach".

## Do

- State the constraint or intent positively: what this code guarantees, what a caller must handle,
  what would break if it changed.
- When something must **not** be added, put it in a rule under `.cursor/rules/` and let the rule
  carry it. A rule is enforced on future work; a comment in one file is not.
- Name a `.cursor/rules/` rule when the reasoning is larger than a sentence. Rules are durable and
  named, so the reference survives.

## Never cite a plan, detail, or step number

Plans and proposal docs are working material. They get renumbered, archived, and deleted — plan sets
are removed outright once their work lands. A comment pointing at `detail 711`, `master step 2.11`,
`P2.4.3`, `Track 9b.6`, or a path under `.llm/plans/` or `docs/proposals/` is a reference that will
outlive what it points to, leaving the next reader with a number that means nothing.

Write the reasoning agnostically, or leave it out. If the point is worth keeping, it is worth
stating in the file; if it is only a breadcrumb back to a plan, it is not worth keeping at all.

```typescript
// BAD — the number is a dead end once the plan is archived
// Suppression is deferred until payment functionality exists — see detail 711.

// GOOD — the same constraint, legible on its own
// Suppression waits on payment functionality. Every reminder surface calls this, so enabling it
// later is a change here and nowhere else.
```

```typescript
// BAD — a path into working material
// Detail: docs/proposals/mobile/_master-plan_/phase-2/details/701-anonymous-subscriptions.md

// GOOD — omit it; the doc comment above already states the ownership rules.
```

This applies to test names, E2E flow comments, and SQL migration headers as much as to source
comments. Commit messages and PR descriptions are the right place for "which plan asked for this".

## Examples

```typescript
// BAD — only meaningful to someone who saw the previous version
// The reason→copy mapping lives here rather than at call sites, which is the difference between one
// consistent affordance and the previous per-screen "needs login" strings.

// GOOD — same point, true on its own
// The reason→copy mapping lives here rather than at call sites so every gated control explains
// itself the same way.
```

```typescript
// BAD — documents a hole left by an edit
// No membership-expiry category: expiry is shown in-app now, never delivered as a notification.

// GOOD — omit it; `no-membership-expiry-notifications` is the durable home for that constraint.
```

## Cleaning up

When you touch a file that already has a backward-looking comment, or one citing a plan or step
number, rewrite or delete it as part of the change. Leaving it is how a file accumulates a changelog
in its margins and a trail of references to documents nobody can find.
