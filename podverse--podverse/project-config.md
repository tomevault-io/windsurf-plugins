# Membership expiry is in-app and on demand, never a notification

Telling a user their membership is expiring soon (or has expired) must **never** go through the
notification system, email, or a scheduled job. A scheduled `membership-expiry-reminder` job, an ORM
scheduler service, a worker handler, and a `membership-expiry` notification category were all built
once and removed as over-engineering. Do not reintroduce them.

There is no `membership-expiry` value in `notification_category_options` or
`NotificationCategoryEnum`, so a notification of that kind cannot be created without first widening
the enum — treat needing to do so as the signal that you are re-adding the wrong thing.

## Why

Expiry is a pure function of a timestamp the client already has. Every surface loads the account
(`/auth/me`) and holds `membership_expires_at`, so the state is derivable on demand with a date
comparison. Routing it through push means a job table row per account, a scheduler, delivery
infrastructure, dedupe-on-change logic, and a user-facing preference toggle — all to say something
the app can work out for free the moment a screen renders.

## Do

- Derive the state with **`getMembershipExpiryNotice`** from `@podverse/helpers`, which returns
  `none` / `expiring_soon` / `expired` plus `daysRemaining`, using the shared
  `MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS` window so surfaces cannot drift.
- Present it **in-app**: web's `MembershipExpirationToast`, mobile's `MembershipExpiredBanner`, the
  persistent More row, and the at-the-feature `GatedFeatureNotice`.
- Consult **`shouldSuppressExpiryReminder`** (`@podverse/helpers`) on every surface, so auto-renew
  suppression stays a one-function change (detail 711).
- Keep the presentation dismissible where it is intrusive, and remember the dismissal against the
  expiry it was dismissed for so a later lapse shows it again.

## Don't

- Don't add a `scheduled_job` row, worker handler, cron, or queue consumer for membership expiry.
- Don't send a push or email for expiring-soon or expired.
- Don't re-add a `membership-expiry` notification category, inbox label, deep-link route, or
  preference toggle.
- Don't hardcode a warning window; import `MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS`.

## Not covered by this rule

**Scheduled jobs in general are fine and still in use** — admin notification campaigns
(`ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_SEND_JOB_TYPE`) run on the same `scheduled_job` runner. This rule is about
membership expiry specifically, not about the mechanism.

Billing and renewal *transactions* (`billingRenewalOrchestrator`) are also out of scope: charging a
card is real server-side work, unlike telling someone a date is approaching.
