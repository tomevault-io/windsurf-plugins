description: Mobile tab stacks are self-contained — do not jump cross-tab for in-flow detail

# Mobile tab stack isolation

Each bottom-tab root owns its **own** native stack. Flows that start in a tab must push (or
replace) screens **on that tab’s stack**, even when that means registering the same detail screen
components on more than one stack (duplicative route registration is intentional).

## Do

- Keep Search → preview/add → channel/episode detail **inside the Search stack**.
- Keep Home feed → channel/episode detail **inside the Home stack**.
- Prefer `navigation.replace(...)` when leaving a stale intermediate screen (e.g. Podcast Index
  “Add podcast” preview after the feed is parsed-ready) so Back does not reopen an invalid state,
  while still leaving the user on the **same tab’s** detail screen.
- Preserve stack state when the user switches tabs (returning to Search should restore Search’s
  hierarchy, not reset to Search root because detail was opened under Home).

## Don't

- Do **not** `parentNavigation.navigate('Home', { screen: 'PodcastDetail', ... })` (or similar
  cross-tab jumps) merely to reuse Home’s detail routes when the user is mid-flow in Search,
  Library, RSS, or More.
- Do **not** clear or reset another tab’s stack as a shortcut for “show this entity.”

## Why

Users expect tab bars to remember where they left off in that tab. Cross-tab navigation makes
Back and tab-return feel broken (e.g. Search add completes on Home detail; returning to Search
lands on Search root instead of the channel they just opened).
