description: The reuse habit covers hooks and plain functions, not just components — search for an existing implementation before writing one, and collapse a duplicate when you find it

# Reuse is not only about components

Shared **components** already have skills pushing work toward them (**reusable-components**,
**mobile-reusable-components**, **ui-component-promotion**). The same instinct has to apply to the
two kinds of code that are far easier to duplicate without noticing, because neither leaves a
visible mark on a screen:

- **Hooks** — data loading, subscriptions to a store, debounced input, mutate-and-refresh cycles.
- **Plain functions** — parsing, comparison, merging, formatting, bucketing, key derivation.

A duplicated component is obvious in review: two things look the same. A duplicated function is
invisible until the two copies disagree, and by then the disagreement is the bug.

## Search before you write

Before adding a hook or a helper, look for one that already does it. Grep the concept, not the name
you were about to give it — the existing copy is called something else, which is why it did not turn
up on its own.

- A date or duration calculation → `packages/helpers/src/lib/date.ts`, `time.ts`
- A hook for a load / refresh / mutate cycle → `apps/<app>/src/hooks/**`, `packages/ui/src/hooks/**`
- Anything already needed by two surfaces → it is probably in `@podverse/helpers` already

## When you find the same logic twice, collapse it

Finding an existing near-copy is the point of looking, not an inconvenience. Extract the shared part
and route both callers through it in the same change. Adding a third copy because collapsing two
looked like scope creep is how a rule ends up implemented three ways and disagreeing three ways.

Split along the line where the surfaces genuinely differ, and share the rest:

- Share the **arithmetic, parsing, and decision**; leave **presentation and locale wiring** to each
  surface. Two inboxes can share which unit describes a gap without sharing how they hold an
  `Intl` formatter.
- Share the **shape and the key**; leave **storage** to each surface. Web and mobile can agree on
  what identifies a screen while one writes a cookie and the other writes AsyncStorage.

## Where it goes

| The logic is…                             | Put it in                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Pure, and useful to more than one surface | `@podverse/helpers` (or the fitting `helpers-*`) |
| Pure, but genuinely mobile-only           | `apps/mobile/src/lib/**`                         |
| Stateful React, shared across web apps    | `packages/ui/src/hooks/**`                       |
| Stateful React, one app                   | `apps/<app>/src/hooks/**`                        |

Package placement detail — which `helpers-*` a utility belongs in — is in
[`.cursor/skills/web/07-reusable-utilities.md`](/.cursor/skills/web/07-reusable-utilities.md); it
reads as web guidance but the table applies to any caller. Mobile may import `@podverse/helpers`
freely; it may **not** import `@podverse/ui` or `@podverse/orm`.

## Don't

- Don't leave a private copy of something that exists in `@podverse/helpers` because importing it
  felt like a bigger diff. The bigger diff is the one that reconciles them later.
- Don't extract for its own sake. A helper closing over one module's constants, used once, is that
  module's plumbing — see **unit-test-design-no-overgranularity** for the same instinct applied to
  tests, and `.cursorrules` on not building abstractions for one-time operations.
- Don't add a file that only re-exports a package symbol — see
  [`avoid-reexport-wrappers`](/.cursor/rules/avoid-reexport-wrappers.mdc).
- Don't move a helper up a tier without checking the direction of the dependency
  ([`architecture-tier-dependencies`](/.cursor/rules/architecture-tier-dependencies.mdc)).
- Don't widen a shared **DTO** without reading
  [`dto-changes-are-device-data-migrations`](/.cursor/rules/dto-changes-are-device-data-migrations.mdc)
  — mobile stores those on disk, so the change reaches installed phones.
