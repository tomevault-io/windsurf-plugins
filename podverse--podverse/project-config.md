# A shared DTO change is a data migration on every installed phone

## The coupling is not where it looks

Mobile SQLite does **not** mirror Postgres. The two schemas are deliberately different shapes: the
server is ~100 normalized tables, the phone is a dozen tables built for offline reads. Mobile cannot
even see the server model — it is forbidden from importing `@podverse/orm`. **A Postgres column
rename, on its own, cannot break the phone.**

What couples them is the **DTOs in `@podverse/helpers`**, and the coupling is durable rather than
compile-time, because mobile writes those DTOs to disk verbatim:

| Mobile column                     | Holds                              | Written from            |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `account_snapshot.payload_json`   | a whole `DTOAccount`               | `GET /auth/me`          |
| `channel_item.payload_json`       | a whole `DTOItem`, per episode     | channel item list       |
| `queue_cache.payload_json`        | queue / now-playing / history DTOs | queue endpoints         |
| `add_by_rss_feed.mapped_feed_json`| a `@podverse/parser-mapping` bundle| server parse            |

So the question to ask when changing a DTO is not "does mobile compile?" It is **"what happens to the
copies already sitting on people's phones?"**

## Why TypeScript will not catch it

Those payloads come back through `safeJsonParse<T>`, which parses and asserts:

```12:14:apps/mobile/src/data/db/serialization.ts
    return parsed as T;
  } catch {
    return null;
```

The assertion is reasonable — the app serialized the value itself — but it means a row written by an
older build satisfies today's type with no complaint. A renamed persisted field can therefore read
as `undefined` until that row is re-fetched, and an offline device may not re-fetch immediately.

## What to check when you change a shared DTO

1. **Is this DTO persisted?** Check the table above. If it is, the change reaches stored data.
2. **How does a stale row recover?** Queue cache expires in five minutes and channel items refresh on
   a 15-minute staleness pass, so those heal themselves once online. `account_snapshot` is replaced
   only by an account refresh, and `add_by_rss_feed` only by a re-parse.
3. **What does the UI do in the gap?** A missing field must degrade, not crash or render a wrong
   value with confidence. Prefer widening before narrowing: add the new field, read both for a
   release, then drop the old one.
4. **Does anything need clearing?** For a breaking nested change there is no mechanism today —
   no payload version, no contract version that wipes the cache. If a row cannot heal, say so
   explicitly and add the invalidation as part of the change.
5. **Test the upgrade, not the install.** A fresh install always looks correct. The case that breaks
   is an existing install with a populated database and no network.

## Changing mobile SQLite

Mobile DDL is device-local and forward-only. Append a migration to `apps/mobile/src/data/db/migrations.ts`
with the next integer version and make the matching edit to `schema.ts` — the two are maintained by
hand, so schema drift requires an explicit review. Never edit a migration that has shipped:
`PRAGMA user_version` means an installed device will never run it again.

A mobile table change needs nothing from the server. The traffic is one-way.

## Don't

- Don't assume "mobile has no code reading this field" ends the analysis — the field is still in
  stored JSON, and the next feature to read it will read the stale copy.
- Don't rename a persisted DTO field and a mobile read site in the same breath without saying what
  happens to devices between the two builds.
- Don't add a runtime validator to `safeJsonParse` as a reflex. It converts a silently-wrong field
  into a discarded row, which is worse for an offline user unless the caller can refetch.
- Don't reach for `@podverse/orm` types in mobile to "keep them in sync." The decoupling is the
  design; DTOs are the contract.
