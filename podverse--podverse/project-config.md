# Mobile screen layout consistency

Tab roots and stack screens share one top chrome and one page-body gutter. Do not invent a
per-screen inset under the title bar.

## Top chrome

- Use **`HeaderBar`** for the slot under the status bar: safe-area inset and a 44pt row. No
  divider, hairline, or shadow under the title.
- Stack titles go through **`ThemedStackHeader`** (already wraps `HeaderBar`).
- Tab roots use the same title slot (Home, Search, …). Page controls such as Home's media-type
  pills and Search's field sit in the body under that bar, not inside it.

## Page body under the bar

The first content below `HeaderBar` uses **`screenBodyInsets(tokens.spacing)`** from
`apps/mobile/src/theme/screenLayout.ts`:

- **Top:** `spacing.lg` between the title row and the first body control
- **Horizontal:** `spacing.lg` on both sides of that body

`MobileScreenContainer` already applies this. Home's feed list and Search's input / results card
must use the same helper — not a one-off `padding` / `margin`, and not a second inner `Card`
padding on top of the page gutter.

Internal gaps (input → results, filter row → row) stay on the screen. Centered empty / loading
(`VerticalCenter`, `CallToActionSection`, `LoadingSection`) fills leftover height; it does not
replace the page gutter.

## Fill empty lists do not scroll

When a list's only body is a fill info state (`VerticalCenter` / `LoadingSection` /
`CallToActionSection` as `ListEmptyComponent`), there is nothing to scroll. Use **`FillList`**
instead of raw `FlatList` — it locks bounce, over-scroll, pull-to-refresh, and `scrollEnabled`
whenever `data` is empty and `ListEmptyComponent` is set. Pass `ListEmptyComponent={null}` when
the empty copy lives in the header and the list should still scroll (filter-no-matches).

## Login-gated fill states

When a screen's body is empty because the feature requires an account, use **`CallToActionSection`**
(it already wraps `VerticalCenter`) plus a Login action — not a bare `ListEmpty` and not
`authentication.login_required`. Prefer **`AuthAwareLoadState`** with `showAuthRequired` and a
feature-specific `authMessageKey` when the screen already uses that wrapper; otherwise wire
`CallToActionSection` as the `FillList` empty (or the only `MobileScreenContainer` child).

The message must explain **why the feature is worth logging in for** (what they get: synced inbox,
history across devices, playlists they can share). Generic “Log in to continue.” is for errors and
inline gates, not a full-screen feature empty. Hide the in-body heading on that fill — the
`HeaderBar` title is enough.

## Do not

- Use a different page gutter (`md`, `2xl`, raw numbers) for the body under `HeaderBar`.
- Rebuild the title-bar height or type in a screen-local `StyleSheet`.
- Add a divider, hairline, or shadow under `HeaderBar`.
- Put a second in-body display heading on a screen that already has a `HeaderBar` title.
- Use raw `FlatList` for a screen list that shows a `VerticalCenter` fill empty, then hand-toggle
  `scrollEnabled` / `bounces` at the screen.
