# COPY-PASTA — Recommended Cursor model & reasoning

When creating or editing a `COPY-PASTA.md` (or `*-COPY-PASTA.md`) file, **every prompt** must tell
the operator which Cursor model **and reasoning level** to use before pasting.

## Required

- Include **`Cursor model:`** and **`Reasoning:`** on **each** prompt (or a phase-level table with
  Model + Reasoning columns).
- Prefer models: **Auto** (cheapest), **Codex 5.3** (medium), **Opus 5** (premium).
- When a newer, higher comparable model is available, prefer it over the older model tier for
  new recommendations, even when the cost is modestly higher. Do not switch to an unrelated
  specialized model solely because it is newer.
- Prefer reasoning: **low**, **medium**, **high**, **extra high** (Cursor thinking depth for that
  model — independent of model choice; e.g. Codex 5.3 + high, Opus 5 + medium).
- Match tier to risk: mechanical/docs → Auto + low; standard features → Codex 5.3 + medium; schema /
  workers / cross-package → Codex 5.3 + high; native/engine/assembly → Opus 5 + high (or extra
  high when concurrency or safety-critical).

Numbered plan files (`01-*.md`, …) in the same plan set should repeat the same **Cursor model** and
**Reasoning** lines at the top so operators see them when opening the plan directly.

## When none of the preferred models fit

Name the alternative model explicitly and add one sentence explaining why (rare).
