description: Every screen and component must be usable with a screen reader; improve coverage as you touch code
---


# Screen reader support is required

Every screen and component we ship must be usable with **VoiceOver**, **TalkBack**, and desktop
screen readers. This is a shipping requirement, not a polish pass.

**A screen reader user must never get less information than a sighted user.** If sighted users can
tell a tab is selected, a button is disabled, or a filter is active, assistive technology must be
able to tell too.

## Improve as you go

When you touch a component, leave it more accessible than you found it. Adding a missing
`aria-label` or `accessibilityRole` to code you are already editing is **in scope** and does not need
to be asked about. Do not rewrite unrelated files to chase coverage — fix what you touch.

## `testID` is not accessibility

`testID` exists for Maestro and Playwright. It is invisible to assistive technology. A control with
a `testID` and no accessible name is **unlabeled**. This is the single most common mistake in this
repo — E2E coverage got applied broadly while labels did not.

## Web — `apps/web`, `apps/management-web`, `packages/ui`

| Requirement            | How                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessible name        | Visible text, or `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby` when there is none      |
| Icon-only buttons      | **Always** `aria-label`; the icon itself gets `aria-hidden`               |
| Images                 | Meaningful `alt`, or `alt=""` when purely decorative                      |
| State                  | `aria-expanded`, `aria-current`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-checked`, `aria-selected` |
| Async updates          | `aria-live` for toasts, playback changes, and results that appear later   |
| Forms                  | Associated `<label>`, plus `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` on error |
| Interactive elements   | Real `<button>` / `<a>`; never a `div` with `onClick`                     |
| Keyboard               | Everything reachable and operable by keyboard, with a visible focus ring  |
| Dialogs                | `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, an accessible name, and focus moved into it |

`@podverse/ui` `IconButton` already throws without a label — follow that contract rather than
routing around it.

## Mobile — `apps/mobile`

| Requirement       | How                                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessible name   | `accessibilityLabel` on every touchable whose purpose is not clear from its text |
| Role              | `accessibilityRole` — `button`, `link`, `header`, `tab`, `switch`, `image`       |
| State             | `accessibilityState` — `selected`, `disabled`, `checked`, `expanded`, `busy`     |
| Grouping          | `accessible` on a row so it reads as one item rather than several fragments      |
| Async updates     | `accessibilityLiveRegion` (Android) / announcements for results and errors       |
| Hints             | `accessibilityHint` only when the action is non-obvious; do not restate the label |

Prefer the shared primitives in `apps/mobile/src/components/primitives/` — `Button` and `ListRow`
already default the label from visible text and set role and state. A raw `Pressable` in a screen is
usually a missed opportunity to use one of them.

## i18n

All accessible names are user-facing strings and resolve through i18n — never hardcoded. See
[`i18n-user-facing-strings`](/.cursor/rules/i18n-user-facing-strings.mdc). Choose the catalog layer
per the usual rules: shared copy in `consumer`, mobile chrome in `mobile`.

## New work has no excuse

Any **new** screen or component must be accessible when it lands. "Add accessibility later" is not an
acceptable plan step, and a plan that omits it is incomplete. Include screen reader behavior in
acceptance criteria the same way you include empty and error states.

## Known gaps

Coverage today is uneven — strongest in `packages/ui` primitives and mobile `Button` / `ListRow`,
weakest in the media player on both web and mobile. There is no accessibility linting or CI gate.
A full audit is scheduled separately; see
[`899-defer-accessibility-audit`](/docs/proposals/mobile/_master-plan_/phase-2/details/899-defer-accessibility-audit.md).
That deferral does **not** excuse new work from this rule.
