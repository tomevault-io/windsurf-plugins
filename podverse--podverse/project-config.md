# End With Targeted Report Verify

For implementation responses in this repo:

0. **Do not run tests during agent or plan work.** Never run test, lint, or verification commands as part of implementation. Only instruct the operator in a fenced `bash` block at the end of the response.
1. **Give the user** one or more runnable verification commands they can copy and run; place them in a fenced `bash` code block at the end of your response.
2. **UI changes (apps/web, apps/management-web, packages/ui):** Instruct the operator to run the narrowest targeted screenshot report and open the hub at `.artifacts/e2e-reports/latest/index.html` (slot cards open each report in a new tab). See **ui-e2e-screenshot-report** skill.
3. **Mobile changes (apps/mobile):** Same habit as web — end with the **most focused** Maestro report command(s) and slot report paths. See **mobile-e2e-screenshots**. Example:

```bash
npm run mobile:e2e:test -- <area>
open .artifacts/mobile-e2e-reports/latest/failures.json
open .artifacts/mobile-e2e-reports/latest/ios-phone/index.html
open .artifacts/mobile-e2e-reports/latest/android-phone/index.html
```

   (Omit `-- <area>` only when the default `hello-world` smoke is the right scope. Label the verify
   block as **Mobile Maestro**. Remind that **Mobile Metro** + **Mobile iOS** / **Mobile Android**
   (and **Mobile E2E API** for API-backed) must already be up — see
   [HOW-TO-RUN.md](/apps/mobile/e2e/HOW-TO-RUN.md) and **vscode-terminals-commands**. Do **not**
   paste leave-running `mobile:dev` / `mobile:dev:e2e` / `mobile:e2e:api` into this block.)
4. **MANDATORY when the change affects E2E:** If you modified UI (web, management-web, or mobile), E2E specs/flows, or any code that E2E covers, you **MUST** end the response with a fenced `bash` block containing the **EXACT** focused command(s) for the affected surface(s).
5. Prefer screenshot-report targets scoped to the changed feature area.
6. Use full-suite report mode only when change scope is broad or cross-cutting.

Preferred commands:

- Web: `make e2e_test_web_report_spec SPEC=e2e/<spec>.spec.ts`
- Management-web: `make e2e_test_management_web_report_spec SPEC=e2e/<spec>.spec.ts`
- Both web apps: `make e2e_test_report_scoped WEB_SPEC=e2e/<web>.spec.ts MGMT_SPEC=e2e/<mgmt>.spec.ts`
- Mobile: `npm run mobile:e2e:test -- <area>` (narrowest `apps/mobile/e2e/<area>.yaml`)
- Full web regression: `make e2e_test_report`
- API only: `npm run test:e2e:api`

**Final COPY-PASTA prompt:** When completing the last step in a plan set (`COPY-PASTA.md` / `00-EXECUTION-ORDER.md`), assume the operator ran all prompts without running tests until the end. List **all** cumulative verification commands for the whole set (dedupe; order: build/lint → unit → API → E2E web/mobile). Use **one** fenced `bash` block for one-shot commands only; for mobile leave-running Metro/API, name **Mobile Metro** / **Mobile E2E API** in prose (HOW-TO-RUN + **vscode-terminals-commands**) — do not force a single-shell paste of blockers. See **response-ending-make-verify**, **mobile-e2e-screenshots**, and **plan-completion** skills.
