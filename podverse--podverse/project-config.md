# Legacy app reference (`podverse-rn`)

## Vocabulary

- **legacy app** / **podverse-rn** / **v4 mobile** = sibling checkout at `../podverse-rn`
  (absolute typical path: `/Users/mitcheldowney/repos/pv/podverse-rn`).
- **Nextgen** = this monorepo (`podverse`), including `apps/mobile`.

## When to look

**Only** open, search, or cite `podverse-rn` when the operator **explicitly** asks for legacy /
podverse-rn / “look at the legacy app” (or equivalent). Do not browse it for ordinary nextgen
tasks.

**Mobile master plan Phase 2 carve-out:** when the operator pastes **legacy app screenshots** to
drive Phase 2 planning, that counts as an explicit request — reading
`../podverse-rn/src/screens/<Name>Screen.tsx` to answer a behavior question about those screenshots
is expected. Follow
[mobile-legacy-screenshot-planning](/.cursor/skills/mobile-legacy-screenshot-planning/SKILL.md).
**Never store the screenshots** in the repo (not `docs/`, `.llm/`, or `.artifacts/`) — convert them
to written notes and plan text.

## How to look

- Prefer the **local sibling** checkout over GitHub remote when the directory exists.
- Treat legacy as **inspiration and guidance**, not a port checklist or source of truth.
- Do **not** assume legacy APIs, navigation, storage, or UX are correct for nextgen.
- Prefer modern Expo / nextgen patterns; call out improvements when reusing ideas or assets.
- Do not edit or publish from `podverse-rn` unless the operator explicitly asks.
