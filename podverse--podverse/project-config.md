# Operator-only Git and publish operations

Agents implement code and manifest changes locally. **Git operations are operator-only** — that includes both **`git`** and **`gh`**. Treat every `gh` command that creates, updates, or deletes remote repo state as a git write (same policy as `git push`).

## Agents must not run

**`git` writes** (unless the user explicitly asked for that exact command in that message):

- `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag` / tag push, force push, remote branch delete
- Merges, rebases, or checkouts that rewrite history for publish

**`gh` writes** (same rule — `gh` is a git operation here):

- `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, `gh pr close`, `gh pr reopen`, `gh pr edit`
- `gh release create`, `gh api` calls that mutate refs, issues, or releases
- Any `gh` subcommand that opens, merges, closes, or updates PRs/branches/tags/releases

Also prohibited without explicit user request: admin merges to protected branches (`staging`, `main`, `develop`) and anything that triggers **Publish (staging)** / release workflows.

**Read-only is fine** when investigating: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `gh pr view`, `gh issue view`, `gh run list`, read-only `gh api`.

## Agents must do instead

1. Leave changes in the working tree (or commit **only** when the user explicitly requested a commit).
2. End with a fenced `bash` block of **exact `git` and `gh` commands for the operator** to review, commit, push, open PR, merge, and publish.
3. State which branch the PR should target (e.g. `staging` for Podverse publish tags) and what to wait for after merge (CI tag, image publish).

## Why

Protected branches and publish pipelines are operator-controlled. Agent-driven pushes and merges bypass review and can trigger unintended releases.
