# Plan Lifecycle

When you finish executing a plan in `active/`, move it to `completed/` automatically (no prompt).
See **Plan Completion** skill for: single-file move vs. moving the whole set when it's the last plan.

1. Move the file (or whole set) from `active/` to `completed/` (preserving subdirectory structure)
2. Update any references in `00-master-plan.md`, a project `00-SUMMARY.md`, or `.llm/LLM.md` if needed

Example:

```bash
mv .llm/plans/active/monorepo-migration/02-packages-outline.md \
   .llm/plans/completed/monorepo-migration/
```
