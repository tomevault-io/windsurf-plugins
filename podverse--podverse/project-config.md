# Surface async errors in mobile UI

In React Native screens (`apps/mobile/src/**`), every async submit/handler (login, signup, refresh,
save, playback actions) must **surface** failures in the UI. A swallowed error looks identical to
"nothing happened" — the screen stalls with no message — and is very hard to diagnose, especially in
Maestro E2E where it shows up only as an assertion timeout.

## Do

- Wrap the awaited call in `try/catch/finally`. Set a visible, user-facing error in `catch`; reset
  loading state in `finally`.
- Render the error in a `Text` node with a stable `testID` (e.g. `login-error`) so E2E can assert the
  failure directly instead of timing out on the success locator.

```tsx
setIsLoading(true);
setError(null);
try {
  const result = await doThing();
  // ...handle known result branches...
} catch {
  setError('Could not complete. Please try again.');
} finally {
  setIsLoading(false);
}
```

## Don't

- Don't use `try { ... } finally { ... }` with **no `catch`** around an `await` — a thrown
  network/parse error is swallowed and the UI silently stays put.
- Don't `catch` and ignore (empty block) without setting user-visible state.
- Don't rely on the happy-path result object alone; thrown errors (network, cleartext, non-401 HTTP)
  never reach result-branch handling.

## Why

Silent failures caused multi-round E2E debugging on auth flows: Submit was tapped, the request threw,
and with no `catch` the screen stayed on the login form with no error — indistinguishable from a
missed tap. See **mobile-e2e-screenshots** (Maestro authoring gotchas).
