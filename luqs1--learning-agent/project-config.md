# AGENTS.md

Guidance for agents and contributors working in this repository.
For the *why* behind the tool — the pedagogy and guiding principles — see the
[Philosophy section of the README](./README.md#philosophy).

## What this is

A single learning agent that teaches through questions, problems, and active
recall instead of lecturing, and that verifies every non-trivial claim against a
persistent, citable knowledge base before stating it. It is shipped to **two
platforms from one repository**: [opencode](https://opencode.ai) and
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Architecture

Three cooperating parts plus a slash command:

- **Agent (`learning`, primary)** — the system prompt that runs the session:
  probe → teach in layers → comprehension check → recall → apply → challenge →
  synthesise.
- **`learning-assessment` (gate skill, not user-invocable)** — before any claim,
  checks whether it is backed by verified, cited research. A single failed check
  forces research. Enforces the iron law: *no claim without a source*.
- **`learning-research` (skill, not user-invocable)** — multi-angle research
  (technical accuracy, expert perspective, contested areas), fetches primary
  sources, and stores them as a structured, citable knowledge base.
- **`learn` (slash command, Claude Code only)** — forks a learning session on a
  given topic.

Runtime flow: **assessment gate → research if it fails → teach with
`[source: filename.md]` citations.**

## Dual-platform structure — keep both trees in sync (IMPORTANT)

The agent prompt and the two shared skills exist as **near-duplicate copies** in
`claude/` and `opencode/`. When you change one, you must mirror the change in the
other. The **only intended differences** between the copies are:

1. **Knowledge-base path:**
   - Claude Code → `~/.claude/learning/<topic-slug>/`
   - opencode    → `~/.config/opencode/learning/<topic-slug>/`
2. **Frontmatter format:**
   - Claude agent (`claude/agents/learning.md`): `name`, `description`, `skills:`
   - opencode agent (`opencode/agents/learning.md`): `description`, `mode`,
     `color` — skills are registered programmatically by
     `.opencode/plugins/learning-agent.js`, not via frontmatter.

The `learn` slash command lives **only** under `claude/` (opencode has no
slash-command equivalent here). Everything else should match.

When bumping the version, update it in all three manifests:
`package.json`, `claude/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## Knowledge-base conventions

- One folder per topic, with a **stable slug** reused across sessions
  (e.g. `rust-ownership-model`). Don't invent a new slug each time.
- `sources.md` holds a table of every fetched source with a credibility rating;
  one `<concept-slug>.md` file per concept.
- Inline citation format is `[source: filename.md]`.
- One concept per file; split files that exceed ~200 lines.
- On returning to an existing topic, **read what's there before researching** —
  only fill gaps, don't re-research.

## Editing conventions

- The two shared skills are **`user-invocable: false`** — they are invoked by the
  agent, not directly by users. Keep them that way.
- Skill and agent definitions are markdown with YAML frontmatter; the opencode
  plugin parses frontmatter itself (see `parseFrontmatter` in the plugin JS), so
  keep frontmatter simple (`key: value`, no nested YAML).
- Prefer editing the prompt/skill content in plain prose; this *is* the product.

## Install / distribution (reference)

- **opencode:** `opencode plugin learning-agent@git+https://github.com/luqs1/learning-agent.git -g`
- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add luqs1/learning-agent` then
  `/plugin install learning-agent@learning-agent`

## Naming (in flux)

The project currently ships as **`learning-agent`** (agent name: `learning`).
The brand name is being revisited — see issue #3 — so a rename is likely later.
Until that lands, `learning-agent` / `learning` remain the canonical identifiers
in all code, manifests, and install commands. Do not partially rename.
