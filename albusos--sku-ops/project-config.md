# Domain Knowledge

## billing_entity is a customer account, not SaaS billing

`BillingEntity` in this app is a **contractor/customer billing account** — the entity a job or withdrawal gets billed to. It has nothing to do with billing the app's operator (there is no in-app SaaS billing).

`billing_entity_id` on `ContractorContext`, `Withdrawal`, `Job`, `Payment`, etc. refers to this customer account FK.

`CurrentUser` does NOT have `billing_entity_id` — that field belongs to contractor user records in the `operations` context, not on the JWT-derived user identity. A contractor's `billing_entity_id` is resolved from their DB record, not from the token.

Do not conflate these concepts when auditing auth, CurrentUser, or financial flows.
