# Project notes for Claude Code

Patterns worth keeping across SPARK loops, distinct from `.spark/constitution.md`
(which holds the project's standing principles) — these are working habits.

## Refuted-with-finding is a valid ceremony outcome

A verify-only sweep (or any test/verification-only feature) that finds a
documented claim does *not* hold live should record it as **refuted-with-finding**,
not silently pass it or fix it inline. Route the finding (verbatim quote,
`file:line`, cause) to wherever the actual fix belongs — often a later increment,
since a verify-only feature's own fence typically forbids touching the files the
fix would require. A failed acceptance criterion is itself a valid, honest
outcome; grinding to force a "confirmed" verdict defeats the point of verifying
at all. See `.spark/graph-gates-verification/evidence.md` (issue #8) for the
worked example.

## Check branch staleness before committing a new feature's work

Before `/increment` starts committing, or at the latest before `/go-live`'s
pre-flight, diff the current working branch against its own merge-base with
`main`. If the branch's prior PR already merged, cut a fresh branch off
`origin/main` for the new feature *before* work piles up on the stale one —
don't discover this at the last gate. `/go-live` for `graph-gates-verification`
had to resolve this as a surprise; catching it earlier (e.g. at `/spark`'s
resume, or `/increment`'s first commit) avoids the detour.

**This recurred.** `project-kickoff`'s whole loop ran uncommitted, directly on
local `main`, which let it drift 8 commits behind `origin/main` unnoticed —
including a fully merged sibling feature touching 4 of the same files
`project-kickoff` itself changed. `/go-live`'s pre-flight caught it (a real
3-way merge check, zero conflicts, then rebuilding the release branch off
current `origin/main`), but only because the rule above was re-checked live
there rather than assumed clean. The sharper fix this second occurrence
argues for: don't work uncommitted on `main` at all — commit to a real
feature branch at the *start* of a loop's work (e.g. `/story-time`'s first
write, or `/increment`'s first task), not only when `/increment` or `/go-live`
happen to check. A branch that exists from the start can't silently drift
underneath work already sitting on it.

## An add-a-file scope check must examine every phase the artifact claims

When planning a new lens (or any artifact whose frontmatter declares which
SPARK phases it owns), verify dispatch **and activation** for every one of
those phases at plan time — not just the phase that happens to already be
wired generically. `accessibility-lens`'s plan checked only `/increment`
(found clean, C6) and stopped; `/peer-review` then had to discover, across
two separate rounds, that `/look-and-feel`, `/demo-day`, `/peer-review`'s own
dispatch parenthetical, and even `/charter`'s activation vocabulary
(`agents/facilitator.md`, `templates/constitution.md`) all shared the same
closed-enumeration defect. Checking every claimed phase's dispatch *and* how
its trigger gets declared in the first place — at Plan, not Review — would
have caught 4 of 5 sites before the diff ever reached a reviewer. See
`.spark/accessibility-lens/evidence.md` (T7, extended at review round 1) for
the worked example.

## A disclosed limitation stays honest only if re-verified at every gate

A `refuted-with-finding` (or any other honestly-disclosed gap) recorded once
does not stay accurate on its own — re-derive it fresh at each subsequent
gate rather than citing the prior gate's word for it. `accessibility-lens`'s
NFR-6 disclosure (a 5-site dispatch/activation gap) was independently
re-verified from primary source four separate times across one loop — plan,
review round 1, review round 2, and QA — with zero drift in either the
`file:line`s or their consequence. That is what kept the disclosure from
going stale between Plan and release; a single write-up trusted forward
would not have caught a fix pass narrowing a citation range by one line
(review round 2's own F9) or a wording change elsewhere going unnoticed.
