description: Response format - outcome first, decision tables with fixed columns, and a Done/Next/Decision-needed status block for multi-step work.

# Response format rules

- Lead with the outcome: the first one or two sentences state the result, answer, or recommendation. Supporting detail comes after.
- Keep main points short and scannable; expand only where the reader needs it to act.
- When the user must choose, present a decision table with the columns Option, What it does, Cost, Risk, Recommended. Mark exactly one option as recommended and give the reason in one line under the table.
- Use tables for comparable facts only; keep reasoning in prose around the table, not inside cells.
- End every multi-step task response with a status block:
  - Done: what was completed and how it was verified.
  - Next: the next task in order, or "none" when the work is complete.
  - Decision needed: present only when a blocking choice belongs to the user.
- When several tasks remain, list them in order and name the one that starts next.
