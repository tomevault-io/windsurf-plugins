description: AgentShield security review for agent surfaces, skills, commands, hooks, MCP, and installer changes.

Run or ask to run `node .vibekit/scripts/agentshield-probe.mjs .` before merging agent-surface changes. Do not run untrusted hooks, MCP servers, deploys, migrations, or remote installers during review. Use `path-sensitive-shell-safety` before changing shell/deploy/installer/repair logic that builds paths from variables or can delete, move, copy, replace, clean, or reset files.
