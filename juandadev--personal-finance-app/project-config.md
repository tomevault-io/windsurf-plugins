# Sole Git Author

The user is the only author. Commits may be created when appropriate, but attribution must never include Cursor, AI tools, or any other co-author.

- Never add `Co-authored-by`, `Signed-off-by`, `Generated-by`, or similar trailers for Cursor, Copilot, Claude, agents, or any other tool or person.
- Never pass `--author` (or equivalent) to attribute a commit to anyone other than the repo’s configured user identity.
- Commit messages must not credit Cursor or other AI tools as authors or co-authors.
- Use the existing local git `user.name` / `user.email`; do not invent or substitute another identity.
