Prefer lowercase SQL keywords.

Prefer concise truthy/falsy checks. `foo && bar` over `foo !== undefined ? bar : undefined`; `!foo` over `foo === undefined` when the guarded branch short-circuits. Avoid verbose `=== undefined` / `!== undefined` chains unless the code genuinely needs to distinguish `undefined` from `null` / `0` / `''`.

The project is currently in two parts:

- packages/sqlfu - all the juicy bits. The client, the CLI, the diff engine, the migrator, the formatter.
- packages/ui - a web server for using sqlfu from the browser. Run queries, migrations, etc.

When I refer to "dev-project", I'm talking about the scratch project which lives at ./packages/ui/test/projects/dev-project - that's the one that I tinker with manually via the UI. You can run commands in it with something like `(cd packages/ui/test/projects/dev-project && tsx ../../../../sqlfu/src/cli.ts check)`.

If I report a bug, it's fine to investigate first, but reproduce with a red test before fixing in code. Check your skills!

Sometimes I'll reference "pgkit". That's a similar project I built a while ago for postgresql. It's checked out next door at ../pgkit, so you should freely explore the code as a reference implementation.

## Deciding where a feature gets documented

Don't jump straight to "add a section to the README". Most non-trivial features need information on several surfaces, and each one is doing a different job. Work through these in order:

1. **Reframe the feature in the project's voice first.** What does this feature look like through the `SQL First, TypeScript Second` lens? A feature that looks like "OpenTelemetry integration" is really *"your query filenames are the query's identity everywhere"*. That reframing decides which existing section or page it belongs near, and often narrows "where does it go" down to one obvious answer.
2. **Assess importance honestly.** Tentpole (hero copy), tentpole-adjacent (augment an existing panel, add a docs page), useful-to-some (docs page only), or niche (inline JSDoc + a sentence in the relevant docs page). Don't add a feature-grid panel for something that isn't a feature-grid-level claim; don't bury something that genuinely differentiates sqlfu from Drizzle/Kysely/Prisma.
3. **Pick the search terms a user would use to find it.** That's the docs page title. SEO beats clever naming — `observability` beats `tracing and errors` because real searches are `sqlfu observability`, `sqlfu opentelemetry`, `sqlfu sentry`. The page title should catch all of them.

### The surfaces, and what each is for

- **Landing page (`website/`)** — hero + existing value panels. Only touch it for tentpole or tentpole-adjacent features, and prefer one sentence inside an existing panel over adding a new panel (a new panel implies a new axis of the product).
- **`packages/sqlfu/README.md`** — this file IS the website's "sqlfu" overview docs page (rendered by `website/build.mjs`). One edit, two surfaces. One paragraph + a link into `docs/*.md` is usually the right shape; don't duplicate the deep-dive content here.
- **Root `README.md`** — generated from `packages/sqlfu/README.md` via `scripts/sync-root-readme.ts`. **Don't edit directly.** Edit the package README; the pre-commit hook will regenerate the root.
- **`packages/sqlfu/docs/*.md`** — deep-dive pages, argument-first. Explain *why*, not just *how*. These are auto-rendered in the website docs sidebar. Recipes for third-party tools (OTel, Sentry, Datadog) belong here, not in the README.
- **CLI `--help`** — command syntax + one-line description. Not the mental model. Someone reading `--help` knows what sqlfu is; they just forgot a flag name. Point to docs only if the command has a real design (e.g. `sqlfu migrate` retry semantics).
- **Error messages** — actionable + recommendation-style. Tell the operator what's wrong and what to do *now*. Assume the state they're in is visible in the error (or include it). Pointer to docs only when the next step isn't obvious from the message.
- **In the UI** — tooltips / inline hints for information that only makes sense alongside state the user has in front of them. A migration card tooltip saying "Pending" is useful; prose paragraphs aren't — they belong in docs.
- **CLAUDE.md (this file / vendored variants)** — agent-specific working conventions, not product documentation. Things that affect *how to work in the repo*, not *what sqlfu does*.

### Reference code in docs should invite copy-paste
