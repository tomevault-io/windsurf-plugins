# pi-worktrunk

`pi-worktrunk` is a pi extension that exposes Worktrunk status, commands, session
continuation, and agent tools.

## Setup

Install Lefthook once per clone:

```bash
uvx lefthook install
```

Pushing runs the quality gates automatically. No need to run checks manually.

## Release engineering

- Use `tenzir-ship` for changelog management and releasing
- Add changelog entries for user facing changes
- Before releasing, ensure `main` is in sync with `origin/main`
- To release, dispatch .github/workflows/release.yaml with a title & intro
