# AGENTS.md

Harness-agnostic entry point for `oss-launch`. If your harness auto-discovers skills the
way Claude Code does (a `SKILL.md` with `description` frontmatter, invoked as a slash
command), install and use it as documented in the README. If your harness has no
skill/slash-command system, this file is your install + invocation path: `SKILL.md` is the
actual workflow definition, everything below just gets you to it on any agent.

## Install per harness

Fastest path for the four harnesses below: clone this repo, run
`bash scripts/build-agent-dirs.sh`, then copy the matching directory out of `dist/`
into your project (or user config dir). Each output dir is self-contained: payload
included, no separate clone needed at runtime.

**Verification status, so you know what you're getting:** Claude Code is the harness this
skill is developed and dogfooded on daily. The Codex CLI, Cursor, and Gemini CLI bundles
are built to each platform's documented extension format, structurally checked in CI, and
verified self-contained (every path their `SKILL.md` names resolves inside the bundle, and
the bundled scripts run from where they land). None of the three has been
**live-trigger-tested** inside a real install: nobody has yet typed "open source this
repo" into one and watched the agent pull the bundle in on its own. If one misbehaves,
that's a bug worth reporting (issue #15 tracks closing this gap; `tests/agent-bundle-verification.md`
records exactly what has and hasn't been checked, and why). The "any other agent" path
below works everywhere regardless, since it needs nothing but a shell and a file read.

### Claude Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnayDhawan/oss-launch.git ~/.claude/skills/oss-launch
```
Auto-discovered from `SKILL.md`'s `description` frontmatter. Invoke with `/oss-launch`
inside any repo you want to open source. (Or copy `dist/.claude/skills/oss-launch/`
into a project-scoped `.claude/skills/`.)

### Codex CLI
*(format-verified, not live-tested; see verification status above)*

Codex loads project skills from `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: same format as Claude
Code, no adaptation needed. Copy `dist/.codex/skills/oss-launch/` into your project's
`.codex/skills/`, or clone this repo there directly.

### Cursor
*(format-verified, not live-tested; see verification status above)*

Copy `dist/.cursor/rules/oss-launch.mdc` (the rule) and `dist/.cursor/oss-launch/` (its
payload) into your project. Cursor has no slash-command auto-discovery for external
skills; the rule uses `description` + `alwaysApply: false` so the agent pulls it in when
your request matches (open-sourcing a repo), same trigger phrases as `SKILL.md`.

Without the build script: copy `SKILL.md`'s content into a `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file
yourself, or just say "Read SKILL.md at `<clone path>` and follow it for this repo."

### Gemini CLI
*(format-verified, not live-tested; see verification status above)*

Copy `dist/.gemini/extensions/oss-launch/` into `.gemini/extensions/` (project) or
`~/.gemini/extensions/` (global). It's a real Gemini CLI extension: `gemini-extension.json`
manifest + a `/oss-launch` custom command (`commands/oss-launch.toml`) + `GEMINI.md`
context file, per Gemini CLI's documented extension format.

### Any other agent with shell + file access (Aider, Windsurf, plain chat)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnayDhawan/oss-launch.git
```
Then open a session in the target repo and say:

> Read `SKILL.md` from `<clone path>` in full and follow its scan -> report -> ask ->
> generate -> re-audit -> launch flow against this repo.

The workflow has no Claude-specific dependency. It only needs bash execution and file
read/write, which every agent harness provides.

## Running it with no agent at all

```bash
bash scripts/audit.sh .                                   # gap checklist, no agent needed
bash scripts/apply.sh . --config oss-launch.config         # full scaffold, no agent needed
```
`audit.sh` alone tells you what OSS files are missing. `apply.sh` runs the actual
generation step (`SKILL.md` step 3: filling `templates/` with the repo's real name,
owner, stack, and license) from a config file instead of an agent asking questions. See
`templates/oss-launch.config.example`. It skips README.md (prose generation is genuinely
agent-only) and never overwrites an existing file.

## What any harness needs to run this

- Shell/bash execution, to run `scripts/*.sh`
- File read + write in the target repo
- `git` and `gh` CLI on `PATH`, for remote detection and repo metadata (`references/scan.md`)
- Network access only for the optional launch modules (demo GIF capture via Playwright,
  `gh repo edit` for metadata). The core scan -> generate flow is fully offline.

## Scope note

`templates/` is the file collection this skill writes into a **user's** repo when
generating an OSS scaffold. The root files (this file, README, LICENSE, `SKILL.md` itself)
describe `oss-launch` the project, not the output it produces. Don't confuse the two when
adapting this AGENTS.md for a harness you're integrating.
