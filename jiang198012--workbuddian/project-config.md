# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Workbuddian is a **desktop-only Obsidian community plugin** (`isDesktopOnly: true`, Obsidian ≥ 1.7.2) that embeds the local **WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy CLI** as an AI chat agent inside a vault. It is an independent rework (derivative) of BuddyBridge (MIT); its UI references Claudian (MIT). Windows + macOS only; Linux is unsupported. Logs are prefixed `[BB]` (BuddyBridge heritage).

## Commands

```bash
npm install            # required first — node_modules is not checked in
npm run dev            # esbuild watch build (rebuilds main.js on save)
npm run build          # tsc -noEmit typecheck THEN esbuild production bundle
npm test               # jest --coverage
npm run test:watch     # jest watch mode
npx jest tests/manager.test.ts     # run a single test file
npx jest -t "substring of test name"   # run tests matching a name
```

`npm run build` runs `tsc -noEmit -skipLibCheck` purely as a typecheck gate — the actual bundle is produced by esbuild, not tsc. There is no separate lint step.

## Build & distribution model

- Entry point `src/main.ts` (default export `WorkbuddianPlugin`) is bundled by `esbuild.config.mjs` into a single **`main.js` at the repo root**. `obsidian`, `electron`, CodeMirror packages, and Node builtins are marked `external`.
- **`main.js` is committed** — `.gitignore` ignores all `*.js` but re-includes `!main.js`. The distributable plugin is the three files `main.js` + `manifest.json` + `styles.css`. When you change source, the committed `main.js` is only correct after a build.
- Two versions coexist and can drift: `package.json` (`1.0.13`, npm/dev) vs `manifest.json` (`0.1.0`, the Obsidian-facing plugin version). `version-bump.mjs` (via `npm version`) syncs `manifest.json` + `versions.json`.

## Architecture

Layered, single-responsibility modules under `src/`. The flow of a message: `features/chat/input.ts` → `core/context/assembleContext.ts` → `providers/codebuddy` (spawns CLI) → streams `StreamChunk`s back into the DOM and into `core/session/manager.ts` for persistence.

- **`providers/codebuddy/index.ts` — the CLI bridge.** `CodebuddyProvider.sendMessage()` is an **async generator** that `spawn`s the codebuddy CLI with `--print --output-format stream-json --session-id <id> --model <m>` and `cwd` = vault path. It parses **newline-delimited JSON** from stdout via `parseStreamLine`, which handles two shapes: (1) an `assistant`/`user` envelope with nested `message.content` blocks, and (2) direct event objects (`thinking` / `message_delta` / `tool_call` / `result` / `error`). Output is normalized to `StreamChunk { type: 'thinking'|'text'|'tool'|'error'|'done' }`. `cancel()` kills the active process (this is the real stop-generation button). Spawn strategy branches on path type: Windows wrappers (`.cmd`/`.exe`/`.bat`) and the bare `codebuddy` fallback are spawned directly; a plain script path is spawned via a resolved `node` binary.

- **`utils/cliPath.ts` — cross-platform auto-discovery.** `resolveCodebuddyPath()` and `findNodeExecutable()` probe a long list of Windows/macOS install locations (WorkBuddy `app.asar.unpacked/cli/bin`, npm global, PATH, `~/.workbuddy/binaries/node/versions/*`, Homebrew, nvm/volta). Falls back to the bare string `'codebuddy'` / `'node'` so the OS resolves it via PATH. This is pure Node (`fs`/`path`/`process`) with no Obsidian imports.

- **`core/session/manager.ts` — `ConversationManager`.** In-memory `Map<id, Conversation>` with a `persistCallback` wired up in `main.ts` (writes through Obsidian's `saveData`). Note the deliberate design: **one shared manager instance backs both the sidebar view and the main-pane view** (created once in `onload`) so the two panels never clobber each other's state with stale snapshots. Views therefore track their own `activeConvId` and read via `getById()`, NOT the manager's internal `getActive()`. `hasConversations()` lets a second view reuse already-loaded memory instead of re-reading from disk.

- **`core/context/assembleContext.ts` — prompt assembly.** `assembleContextText()` composes the user text with optional blocks separated by `---`: vault-path preamble (when `injectVaultContext`), current-note link (when `injectCurrentNoteLink`), and an `@`-reference block. Pure function, unit-tested.

- **`features/chat/` — the Obsidian view layer.** `view.ts` (`WorkbuddianChatView extends ItemView`, `VIEW_TYPE_CHAT = "workbuddian-panel"`) builds the DOM; `input.ts` owns `sendMessage()` (the streaming loop that mutates the assistant bubble live and calls `manager.updateMessage(..., skipSave=true)` during the stream, then `manager.flush()` once at the end); `render.ts` renders messages via Obsidian's `MarkdownRenderer`; `tabs.ts` handles tab bar, rename, delete, search, and the export context menu.

- **`shared/` — pure helpers.** `atReferences.ts` parses `@[[note]]` references; `export.ts` formats a conversation as Markdown.
