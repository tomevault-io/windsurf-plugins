# Model Matchmaker - Cursor AI Rules

## Shared Rules (ALWAYS apply these)

This project is independent but follows Valyss ecosystem standards. Apply ALL rules from:
- `~/.cursorrules` (global: git safety, secrets, documentation, writing voice, public content security)
- `~/.cursor/rules/git-workflow.mdc` (commit workflow)
- `~/.cursor/rules/public-content-security.mdc` (sanitization for open-source/shared content)

---

## Project Overview

Model Matchmaker is a local Cursor hook that classifies prompts before sending and recommends the right Claude model. Three files: `model-advisor.sh`, session-init/track-completion hooks.

---

## Repository Content Rules

**This repo contains ONLY code and technical documentation.**

### What Goes in This Repo
- Hook scripts (`.sh` files)
- Configuration files (`hooks.json`)
- Technical docs (README.md, AUTO_SWITCH_SETUP.md, troubleshooting)
- Code comments and API documentation
- Test harnesses and examples

### What Does NOT Go Here
- **Marketing content** (release posts, social media copies, promotion materials)
- **Business planning** (strategy docs, roadmap justifications, partnerships)
- **Personal drafts** (pre-write content, brainstorms, unfinished ideas)

**All marketing/business content goes to:** a separate private directory outside this repo (e.g., `~/private-docs/model-matchmaker-release/`)

This ensures the repo stays technical and doesn't accidentally expose business decisions to the public.

## Git Workflow

### Commit Early, Commit Often
- Commit after each logical unit (one feature, one fix, one refactor)
- Commit messages explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Format: `<type>: <message>` where type is one of: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore

### Examples
```
feat: add auto-switch feature for automatic model changing
fix: handle edge case in prompt classification for long analytics strings  
docs: update README with auto-switch setup instructions
refactor: extract keyword lists into separate configuration arrays
chore: update analytics script output format
```

### Commits to Avoid
- Don't combine "add feature + remove old + wire up" - split into separate commits
- Don't leave >500 lines uncommitted across >3 files
- Don't mix feature work with documentation rewrites in one commit

## Code Organization

### File Structure
```
hooks/
  model-advisor.sh         # Main classifier (python embedded in bash)
  session-init.sh          # Session context injection
  track-completion.sh      # Task outcome logging
  analytics.sh             # Analytics dashboard
  auto-switch-model.sh     # Automatic model switching via keyboard automation
  toggle-auto-switch.sh    # Enable/disable auto-switch
  AUTO_SWITCH_SETUP.md     # Auto-switch setup and troubleshooting

skills/
  optimize-classifier/     # Analyze overrides and auto-tune patterns
  share-analytics/         # Sanitized analytics reporting

README.md                  # Main documentation
hooks.json                 # Cursor hook configuration
```

### Python in Bash Safety

When embedding Python in bash `python3 -c '...'` heredocs:

**SAFE (use `chr()` for special characters):**
```python
snippet = text[:40].replace(chr(10), " ").replace(chr(34), chr(39))
newline = chr(10)
quote = chr(34)
```

**UNSAFE (breaks bash quoting):**
```python
snippet = text[:40].replace("\n", " ")  # Backslash escapes break
snippet = text[:40].replace("\"", "'")  # Escaped quotes break
```

This is critical: exit code 2 = Cursor blocks the prompt and locks the user out. Always test:
```bash
echo '{"prompt":"test","model":"claude-4-opus"}' | bash hooks/model-advisor.sh
```

Should output valid JSON, never bash errors.

## Feature Development

### Before Starting New Features
1. Check if similar functionality was discussed in prior commits
2. Review current keyword lists and classification logic
3. Test locally: `echo '{"prompt":"...","model":"..."}' | bash hooks/model-advisor.sh`

### Classification Task

When adding new keyword patterns:
1. Add to appropriate list in `model-advisor.sh` (haiku_patterns, sonnet_patterns, opus_keywords)
2. Test with sample prompts: `! git commit test` should recommend Haiku
3. Document the pattern choice in code comments
4. Update README if adding new routing rules

### Auto-Switch Development

The auto-switch feature:
- Uses `Cmd+/` keyboard shortcut (official Cursor shortcut)
- Proxies through Terminal.app (has macOS Accessibility permissions)
- Auto-closes Terminal window after each switch
- Survives hook timeout via `start_new_session=True` (subprocess detachment)

When debugging auto-switch:
- Check audit log: `tail ~/.cursor/hooks/auto-switch-audit.log`
- Test manually: `~/.cursor/hooks/auto-switch-model.sh haiku --test`
- Verify Terminal has Accessibility permission

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test the classifier directly
echo '{"prompt":"git commit -m test","model":"claude-4-opus"}' | bash hooks/model-advisor.sh
# Should output: {"continue": false, "user_message": "..."}

# Test auto-switch (requires Accessibility permissions)
~/.cursor/hooks/auto-switch-model.sh haiku --test
# Should switch model in Cursor

# Test analytics
./hooks/analytics.sh
./hooks/analytics.sh --days 7
```
