# phlex-reactive

Reactive [Phlex](https://www.phlex.fun) components for Rails — Livewire-style
actions and live cross-tab updates, without writing Stimulus controllers or
hand-picking Turbo Stream targets.

## Tech Stack

- **Ruby**: >= 3.2 | **Rails**: >= 7.1
- **Rendering**: phlex-rails (Phlex 2)
- **Transport**: turbo-rails (Turbo Streams); [pgbus](https://github.com/mhenrixon/pgbus) optional for Postgres SSE
- **Client**: one generic Stimulus controller (no per-feature JS)
- **Autoloading**: zeitwerk
- **Testing**: RSpec + Capybara/Playwright (via `spec/dummy`)
- **Linting**: Standard (`standardrb`)

## Critical Rules

### Never Do
1. **NO hand-picked Turbo Stream targets** — a component self-targets via its stable `#id`
2. **NO shipping component STATE to the client** — the DOM carries a *signed identity* (`{c, gid}` or `{c, state}`), never raw state
3. **NO trusting client input for authorization** — the signature proves the token is ours, NOT that this user may act; authorize inside the action
4. **NO undeclared actions** — only methods declared with `action :name` are invokable (default-deny)
5. **NO raw mass assignment** — action params pass through the declared schema (`params: { x: :integer }`)
6. **NO hard dependency on pgbus** — broadcasts route through `Turbo::StreamsChannel`; phlex-reactive must work on Action Cable OR pgbus
7. **NO `dom_id` (Phlex render-time helper) inside `#id`** — `#id` runs before render; use `Streamable#dom_id` (delegates to `ActionView::RecordIdentifier`)
8. **NO bare `**on(...)` merged with another `data:`/`class:`** — use Phlex `mix(on(:x), data: {...})` or the extra hash clobbers `on`'s `data:`

### Always Do
1. **TDD**: Write tests BEFORE implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
2. **Authorize every mutating action** — `authorize! @record, :update?` (register the error in `Phlex::Reactive.authorization_errors`)
3. **Declare a param schema** for any action that takes input
4. **Re-render through a real view context** — go through `Phlex::Reactive.renderer` / the controller, never a fabricated context (dom_id/url_for/t()/csrf must work)
5. **Capability-detect pgbus features at runtime** — probe the actual keyword (`broadcast.parameters` includes `:exclude`), never `defined?(Pgbus)` alone or a version string
6. **Degrade gracefully** — every pgbus-only feature must no-op or fall back when pgbus is absent
7. **Control the reply via the return value** — return a `Phlex::Reactive::Response` (`replace`/`update`/`remove`/`redirect`/`with`, chain `.flash(level, content)` / `.stream(...)`) to govern the actor's HTTP reply; returning anything else keeps the implicit single replace. See the README "Controlling the action's reply" section and `lib/phlex/reactive/response.rb`.

## Commands

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/phlex spec/requests   # Fast suite (unit + request + broadcast)
bundle exec rspec spec/system                # Browser suite (Playwright; CAPYBARA_SERVER=webrick locally)
bundle exec standardrb                       # Lint
bundle exec rake                             # spec + standard
```

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/lfg` | Full autonomous workflow: branch → understand → explore → plan → TDD → verify → PR |
| `/tdd` | Enforce RED → GREEN → REFACTOR |
| `/architect` | Coordinate a change across the component → endpoint → client layers |
| `/security` | Security audit (signed identity, default-deny, params, CSRF, connection-id) |
| `/review-pr` | Review a PR for pattern compliance |
| `/github-review-pr` | Full PR pass: fix CI failures, then resolve review comments (in that order) |
| `/github-review-failures` | Fix failing CI checks until green |
| `/github-review-comments` | Process unresolved PR review comments |

## Architecture

```
Layer 4: Client runtime    app/javascript/phlex/reactive/reactive_controller.js (ONE generic Stimulus controller)
Layer 3: Endpoint          app/controllers/phlex/reactive/actions_controller.rb (verify token → run action → render the returned Response, else re-render)
Layer 2: Component mixin    lib/phlex/reactive/component.rb (reactive_record/reactive_state, action, reactive_attrs, on)
Layer 1: Streamable mixin   lib/phlex/reactive/streamable.rb (#id, replace/append/..., broadcast_*_to, to_stream_replace, to_stream_remove)
Layer 1: Response           lib/phlex/reactive/response.rb (replace/update/remove/redirect/with, flash, stream)
Layer 0: Core + config      lib/phlex/reactive.rb (verifier, renderer, base_controller_name, authorization_errors, action_path, flash_target)
         Engine             lib/phlex/reactive/engine.rb (mounts the endpoint, pins the client controller)
```

## The mental model

> A component owns a stable DOM `id`. Everything — a click, a form change, a
> background broadcast — reduces to **"render this component into that id."**

Client interactivity (`Component`) and server-pushed live updates (`Streamable`)
converge on ONE re-render unit. See `docs/architecture.md`.

## Security model

- **Signed identity, not state**: the DOM holds a `MessageVerifier`-signed
  `{c, gid}` (record-backed) or `{c, state}` (state-backed). Tampering the class,
  record, or state fails verification → 400.
