# AI Operator Guide

This file is for AI assistants, coding agents, and automation tools.

## Goal

Help the user keep historical Codex threads visible after switching `model_provider`, including provider metadata alignment and recovery from managed backups.

This project ships only the Node CLI. Use the CLI when executing directly, or give the user the one-shot prompt from the README when they want Codex to handle recovery for them.

The tool primarily works by updating both:

- rollout metadata under `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions`
- SQLite thread metadata in `~/.codex/sqlite/state_5.sqlite` (legacy fallback: `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`)

The CLI may also repair missing sidebar project roots from recorded thread metadata when the current global state indicates they should still exist.

Do not solve this by manually editing rollout files only unless the user explicitly asks for manual intervention.

## Important Diagnostic Lesson

If history appears briefly and then disappears again, do not assume it is only a cache problem or that `.codex` is simply too messy.

First verify which SQLite database Codex App is actually reading:

- modern path: `~/.codex/sqlite/state_5.sqlite`
- legacy fallback: `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`

The modern path is authoritative when it exists. A common failure mode is:

- rollout files already show the target provider
- the legacy root `state_5.sqlite` already shows the target provider
- the modern `sqlite/state_5.sqlite` still has stale provider/cwd/user-event metadata

In that case Codex App will keep rendering from the stale modern SQLite index, so history can still be hidden even after rollout files look correct.

An effective sync should be able to repair these together:

- rollout `model_provider`
- SQLite `threads.model_provider`
- SQLite `threads.cwd`, including `\\?\` extended-length Windows prefixes
- SQLite `threads.has_user_event`
- `.codex-global-state.json` `thread-workspace-root-hints`

When diagnosing, compare rollout counts and SQLite counts from `codex-threadkeeper status`. After a successful repair, they should align under the current provider. Treat nonzero `Normalized SQLite cwd rows`, `Repaired SQLite user-event rows`, or `Added thread workspace hints` as useful signs that the command repaired the index Codex App actually uses.

## Preferred Flow

Use this order by default:

1. Run `codex-threadkeeper status`
2. Read `Current provider` and compare rollout/SQLite distribution
3. Decide whether the user needs `sync`, `switch`, or `restore`
4. Run the command
5. Report whether the result is complete or partially skipped due to locked files

## Command Selection

Use `codex-threadkeeper sync` when:

- the user already switched auth/provider using another tool
- the current `config.toml` root `model_provider` is already correct
- the user says things like:
  - "make my old sessions visible again"
  - "resync my Codex history"
  - "I already switched provider"

Use `codex-threadkeeper switch <provider-id>` when:

- the user wants to change the root `model_provider`
- the user wants one command to both switch provider and resync history

Use `codex-threadkeeper restore <backup-dir>` when:

- the user wants to roll back a previous sync
- the user synced to the wrong provider

Use `codex-threadkeeper status` only when:

- the user asks for inspection only
- you need a safe first step before deciding what to do

## Important Behavior

- `sync` uses the current root `model_provider` from `~/.codex/config.toml`
- if root `model_provider` is missing, `sync` falls back to `openai`
- `switch` changes root `model_provider`, then runs a sync
- built-in `openai` is always valid
- custom providers must already exist in `config.toml`
- the tool does not log the user in and does not manage `auth.json`
- sync and switch create a backup first, then automatically prune older managed backups
- backup pruning only touches backups created by this tool under `backups_state/threadkeeper`
- pinned sidebar projects are optional and disabled by default during `sync` / `switch`; use `--restore-pinned-projects` only when the user explicitly wants the old fixed project list restored

## Error Handling

If the output says `state_5.sqlite is currently in use`:

- explain that Codex does not always need to be closed before `sync`
- tell the user to close Codex, Codex App, and app-server
- then rerun the same command

If sync reports `Skipped locked rollout files`:

- treat the sync as mostly successful
- if SQLite did not report `state_5.sqlite is currently in use`, do not require closing all of Codex
- explain that the active session still holds one or more rollout files open
- tell the user to rerun `codex-threadkeeper sync` after that session ends if they want a full rewrite

If `switch <provider-id>` fails because the provider is missing:

- tell the user to define it in `config.toml` or switch via their existing provider tool first
- then run `codex-threadkeeper sync`

## Safe Defaults

- default Codex home: `~/.codex`
- prefer `status` before destructive-looking operations, even though this tool only edits metadata
- by default the tool keeps the most recent 5 managed backups
- use CLI `--keep <n>` when the user wants a different retention count
