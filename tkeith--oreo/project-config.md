# Project Guidelines and Patterns

## Tech Stack

- Full-stack TypeScript application
- TanStack Router (NOT Next.js)
- React
- tRPC
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS with @tailwindcss/forms
- HeadlessUI (@headlessui/react)
- Zod for validation
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Zustand with persist middleware for state management
- Lucide React for icons
- Google OAuth for authentication
- JWT for session management

## Import Aliases

- ALWAYS use `~/...` imports over relative imports
- `~/...` maps to `src/...`

## File Organization

### Server Code

- Keep server-specific code in `src/server`
- NEVER import files from `src/server` in client-side code
- Each tRPC procedure should be in its own file in `src/server/trpc/procedures/`
- Routers go in `src/server/trpc/routers/`
- Make sure to use `createTRPCRouter` when creating new routers (see other examples in the code)

### Routes

- Use file-based routing with TanStack Router
- When creating pages, ALWAYS include "index.tsx" in the filename to avoid route conflicts
  - Use `some-page.index.tsx` or `some-page/index.tsx`, NOT `some-page.tsx`
- Put non-route components in `src/components/`

### Schemas

- All Zod schemas go in `src/schemas/`
- Use schemas to validate and parse all external data (API responses, form inputs, etc.)

## Authentication Pattern

- JWT-based authentication (stateless, no sessions table needed)
- Store ONLY the token in Zustand/localStorage, not user data
- Fetch user data from server when needed using the token
- No server-side logout needed (just clear token client-side)
- Simple authentication checks in components using useEffect, NOT beforeLoad hooks

## State Management (Zustand)

### Correct Pattern

```typescript
// Store setup with proper type annotation (note the double parentheses)
export const useStore = create<StoreType>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // state and actions
    }),
    {
      name: "storage-key",
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage),
    }
  )
);

// Computed values as custom hooks (NOT in the store)
export const useComputedValue = () => {
  return useStore((state) => /* compute from state */);
};
```

### Don'ts

- DON'T put computed values as functions in the store
- DON'T store user data alongside auth token (keep concerns separated)

## tRPC Usage

### Correct Client Pattern

```typescript
import { useTRPC } from "~/trpc/react";
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";

function Component() {
  const trpc = useTRPC();

  // For queries
  const queryResult = useQuery(
    trpc.procedure.queryOptions(
      {
        /* input */
      },
      {
        /* tanstack query options like enabled */
      },
    ),
  );

  // For mutations
  const mutation = useMutation(
    trpc.procedure.mutationOptions({
      onSuccess: (data) => {
        /* handle success */
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        /* handle error */
      },
    }),
  );
}
```

### Server Patterns

- Use `baseProcedure` from `~/server/trpc/main` (NOT publicProcedure)
- Use `verifyToken(token)` from `~/server/auth` for authentication
- Use `db` from `~/server/db` for database access (NOT prisma directly)
- NEVER use headers with tRPC
- Pass all data (including auth tokens) as parameters
- AVOID tRPC middleware - use helper functions in procedures instead
- Each procedure in its own file for better organization

## React Patterns

### Navigation

- Always use `void` operator with navigate to handle promises:
  ```typescript
  void navigate({ to: "/path" });
  ```

### Component Simplicity

- AVOID fancy loader features (beforeLoad, defer, suspense boundaries)
- Handle loading states directly in components
- Use simple useEffect for redirects and side effects
- Focus on functionality over optimization initially
- Don't worry about waterfall loading patterns

## Running the app and managing the database

- Database pushes & migrations happen automatically in our CI pipeline, don't try to run or generate these manually, just modify the schema
- The app will be automatically run by our CI system, don't try to run it yourself
- DO NOT try to run `pnpm prisma db push`, `pnpm run dev`, or anything similar

## Code Style

### General

- Break up large pages into smaller components in separate files
- Use Tailwind CSS without custom styles wherever possible (but when we're trying to use code snippets that are heavy on custom/inline styles, feel free to use them)
- Focus on good design using your own judgment
- Take two passes: functionality first, then design improvements

### TypeScript

- Use proper TypeScript types everywhere
- Follow ESLint rules strictly
- Handle all promises (await, .then/.catch, or void operator)
- NEVER use `any` - use `unknown` instead
- AVOID type assertions (`as`) unless absolutely necessary
- AVOID `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, or ESLint disable comments
- When converting from `unknown` to known types, use Zod schemas for validation
- Performance overhead from Zod parsing is acceptable - prioritize type safety

## Environment Variables

- Server env vars are validated in `src/server/env.ts` using Zod
- Client-side: use tRPC endpoints to fetch public config (don't expose env vars)

## Development Workflow

- Run with Docker: `./scripts/run`
