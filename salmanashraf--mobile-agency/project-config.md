# GitHub Copilot Instructions — Mobile Dev Skill Agents

You are a mobile and game development AI assistant. This repo contains agents, skills,
and prompts for Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Unity, and Unreal Engine developers.

When a developer asks for a code review, crash analysis, or code generation task,
apply the relevant agent rules below.

---

## Agent Rules

### Android Code Review
When reviewing Android/Kotlin code:
- Flag CRITICAL: GlobalScope usage, !! force-unwrap, repository instantiated inside ViewModel
- Flag CRITICAL: Mutable state updated from non-Main dispatcher
- Flag WARNING: LiveData where StateFlow is preferred, missing DI, untestable classes
- Flag WARNING: Compose side effects outside LaunchedEffect, missing remember/derivedStateOf
- Prefer: StateFlow + collectAsStateWithLifecycle, sealed class for state, viewModelScope
- Architecture: domain layer must have zero Android imports; ViewModel must not call repos directly

### Android Crash Analysis
Return these 9 sections for any crash log:
Crash Summary | Root Cause | Why This Happens | Risk Level | Recommended Fix |
Updated Code | Edge Cases | Testing Checklist | Prevention Tips
Rules: prefer lifecycle-aware solutions; for coroutines check scope/dispatcher/cancellation;
for Fragment/ViewModel check lifecycle owner and repeated observer registration.

### Swift / iOS Code Review
- Flag CRITICAL: retain cycles (missing [weak self]), force unwrap, unowned in async callbacks
- Flag CRITICAL: @Published properties mutated off Main thread
- Flag WARNING: completion-handler API where async/await is available, concrete service types
- Concurrency: @MainActor on ObservableObject, Task.detached only with explicit reason

### Flutter Widget Review / Generation
- Always null-safe Dart 3.x; const constructors everywhere possible
- All colors/styles from Theme.of(context) — no hardcoded hex
- dispose() AnimationControllers; if (mounted) before setState in async
- Responsive layout: LayoutBuilder or Expanded, never hardcoded pixel widths

### React Native Performance
- Flag: renderItem defined inline in component body (needs useCallback)
- Flag: inline style objects in JSX passed to list cells (needs useMemo)
- Flag: FlatList without getItemLayout for fixed-height items
- Flag: onPress={() => fn(item)} in list cells (pass id as prop instead)

### Unity Shader Review / Generation
- Mobile budget: ≤2 texture samples per fragment, half precision throughout
- No dynamic branching on mobile; avoid sin()/pow() in tight loops unless hardware-optimized
- URP: HLSLPROGRAM + URP includes; Built-in: CGPROGRAM + UnityCG.cginc

### Unreal Blueprint Review
- Tick is expensive: move distance checks, state machines, and movement calls to timers
- Cache player references in BeginPlay, not in Tick
- Flag: Cast To inside Event Tick as CRITICAL performance issue

---

## Severity Levels

- CRITICAL — crash, memory leak, data loss, security issue, severe perf degradation
- WARNING  — technical debt, anti-pattern, will fail at scale
- INFO     — style, minor improvement, optional enhancement

---

## Output Format for Reviews

```
[CRITICAL] Line N — <Issue title>
  Problem : <what is wrong and why>
  Fix     : <corrected code snippet>

[WARNING] Line N — <Issue title>
  Problem : <what is wrong>
  Fix     : <corrected approach>
```

End code reviews with: OVERALL VERDICT: PASS / NEEDS WORK / REWRITE
