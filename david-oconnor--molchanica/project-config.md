## Unit tests
Do not add unit tests permanently. You may add them transiently e.g. while adding or updating
functionality; clean them up after.


## Code format
Add appropriate line breaks in code; I have noticed LLMs tend to not use
line breaks, which makes it tough for me to read and edit code.


## If on a machine without Cuda/nvidia graphics card
Use the `--no-default-features` flag to compile without needing CUDA.
