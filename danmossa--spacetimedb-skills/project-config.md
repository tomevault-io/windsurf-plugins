# Guidance for AI Agents Working in This Repo

This repository contains **SpacetimeDB skills** for AI coding agents. When editing or adding skills, follow these rules.

## Repo structure

- **skills/** — Each subdirectory is one skill. The CLI and agents discover skills by scanning `skills/` for directories that contain `SKILL.md`.
- **Skill directory name** must exactly match the `name` in that skill’s frontmatter (e.g. `skills/stdb-table-event/` ↔ `name: stdb-table-event`).

## SKILL.md requirements

- **Frontmatter (YAML):**
    - `name` (required): lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars, must match parent directory name.
    - `description` (required): what the skill does and when to use it; include trigger terms so agents know when to apply it. Max 1024 chars.
- **Body:** Markdown instructions. Keep under ~500 lines; put long reference material in `references/` or `scripts/` and link from SKILL.md.

## Conventions

- Write descriptions in **third person** (e.g. "Use when…" not "You can use when…").
- Be concise; avoid restating general SpacetimeDB docs. Focus on correct API usage, pitfalls, and patterns.
- When adding a new skill: create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, then update README.md "Skills" table and "Structure" section.
