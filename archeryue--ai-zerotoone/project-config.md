# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Context

This is the **Diffusion** subdirectory of the AI-ZeroToOne Season-3 learning repository, focused on content generation using diffusion models. It follows the architectural patterns established in the sibling VAE and GAN directories.

The parent repository structure:
```
AI-ZeroToOne/Season-3/
├── VAE/       # Variational Autoencoder implementations
├── GAN/       # Generative Adversarial Network implementations
└── Diffusion/ # Diffusion model implementations (this directory)
```

## ⚡ User Preferences - IMPORTANT

**The user prioritizes FAST training and SHORT iteration times.** When making any changes or suggestions:

1. **Always enable performance optimizations:**
   - `torch.compile()` is ENABLED BY DEFAULT (27% faster, benchmarked on RTX 5060 Ti)
   - Mixed precision training is default (AMP)
   - Use efficient implementations over readable but slow code

2. **Prefer faster settings over quality when in doubt:**
   - Smaller batch sizes for faster iteration
   - Fewer sampling steps during training
   - Lower `save_every` and `sample_every` for quick feedback
   - Smaller models for testing before scaling up

3. **Optimization is a priority:**
   - Our custom U-Net is 23% faster than HuggingFace Diffusers
   - Our U-Net + torch.compile() is 27% faster than baseline
   - Always benchmark before suggesting alternatives

4. **When suggesting training runs:**
   - Default to faster configs for initial testing
   - Clearly separate "fast test" vs "production quality" settings
   - Mention estimated training time

## Common Development Commands

### Training Commands

Based on the established patterns in VAE and GAN directories, expect training scripts to follow this pattern:

```bash
# Basic training (when implemented)
python training.py

# With custom parameters
python training.py --epochs 200 --batch-size 32 --learning-rate 0.0001

# Resume from checkpoint
python training.py --resume checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch_50.pth

# Force CPU usage
python training.py --device cpu

# Test setup only
python training.py --test-only
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# TensorBoard for monitoring training progress
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test model and dataloader setup (when implemented)
python test_setup.py
```

## Architecture Patterns

This project should follow the established Season-3 architectural patterns:

### Directory Structure

Expected modular organization (follow VAE/GAN patterns):

```
Diffusion/
├── config/          # Configuration dataclasses or modules
├── model/           # Diffusion model implementations
├── loader/          # Dataset loading utilities
├── trainer/         # Training loop management
├── utils/           # Visualization and utility functions
├── training.py      # Main training entry point
├── generate.py      # Inference/sampling script
├── test_setup.py    # Model and data testing
├── requirements.txt # Dependencies
├── README.md        # Documentation
├── checkpoints/     # Saved model states
├── logs/            # TensorBoard event files
└── samples/         # Generated images/outputs
```

### Configuration Pattern

Use either:
- **Dataclass approach** (like GAN): Type-safe configuration objects
- **Module-level constants** (like VAE): Simple parameter definitions

Example dataclass pattern:
```python
@dataclass
class DiffusionConfig:
    image_size: int = 64
    timesteps: int = 1000
    batch_size: int = 64
    learning_rate: float = 2e-4
    beta_schedule: str = 'linear'  # or 'cosine'
```

### Model Implementation Pattern

Follow the established patterns:
- Abstract base classes for core functionality
- Dataset-specific variants when needed
- Clear separation: noise scheduling, forward/reverse diffusion, sampling

### Trainer Pattern

Implement a trainer class following the established convention:
```python
class DiffusionTrainer:
    def __init__(self, config, model, dataloader):
        # Initialize model, optimizer, scheduler, tensorboard writer

    def train_epoch(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Single epoch training logic

    def train(self, start_epoch=0):
        # Full training loop with checkpointing

    def save_checkpoint(self, path, epoch):
        # Save model, optimizer, config
```

### Data Loading Pattern

Follow the HuggingFace datasets pattern from VAE/GAN:
```python
def get_dataloader(dataset_name='celeba', batch_size=64):
    # Load from HuggingFace datasets
    # Define transforms (resize, normalize to [-1, 1])
    # Wrap in custom Dataset class
    # Return DataLoader
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Diffusion Model Specifics

1. **Noise Schedule**: Implement beta scheduling (linear, cosine, or quadratic)
2. **Forward Process**: Add Gaussian noise progressively over T timesteps
3. **Reverse Process**: Learned denoising from pure noise to data
4. **Loss Function**: Simplified L2 loss on predicted noise (DDPM approach)
5. **Sampling**: Iterative denoising process for generation

### Expected Core Components

- **Noise scheduler**: Beta/alpha schedule management
- **Diffusion model**: U-Net or similar architecture for noise prediction
