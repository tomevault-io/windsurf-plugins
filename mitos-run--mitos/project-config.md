## Project Overview

Snapshot-fork sandboxes for AI agents on Kubernetes. The system boots Firecracker microVMs, forks them via copy-on-write snapshots, and exposes the whole lifecycle through declarative CRDs (SandboxPool, Sandbox, Workspace) in API group `mitos.run/v1`.

Components:

- **controller** (Deployment): reconciles the CRDs, selects nodes, drives forkd.
- **forkd** (DaemonSet): per-node fork daemon; gRPC on :9090 for the controller, HTTP sandbox API on :9091 for exec and file traffic.
- **guest agent** (PID 1 in the VM): speaks the vsock protocol for exec, files, env, and fork notifications.
- **sandbox-server** (standalone): the same engine behind a plain REST API, no Kubernetes required.
- **Python SDK** (`sdk/python`): client for both k8s mode and sandbox-server mode.

ROADMAP.md is the priority order for all work. docs/api/v2-spec.md is the target API.

## Operating Principles

These outrank convenience:

1. **No unverified claims.** Every public number must be reproducible from `bench/` or it does not get written.
2. **Security findings block features.** The threat model (docs/threat-model.md) must be updated in the same PR whenever the security surface moves.
3. **Honest Kubernetes semantics.** Sandboxes are not pods; never imply pod-scoped mechanisms (NetworkPolicy, ResourceQuota, PSA) govern them.
4. **Boring failure behavior.** Every component defines what happens on crash, node loss, slow etcd, and capacity exhaustion.
5. **Bare metal is a first-class target.**
6. **Experience is DNA.** Every user-facing surface follows the journey rules:
   no dead ends, simple surface with depth one click down, intent-shaped aha.
   See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-hosted-launch-journey-design.md.
7. **Self-host is first-class (Apache-2.0).** mitos is open source and people run
   it themselves; the self-hosted experience is a peer of the hosted one, never an
   afterthought to the SaaS. One console image and SPA serve both, differing ONLY
   by the capabilities document (`GET /console/capabilities`); never fork an
   edition build. Every hosted-only surface (self-serve signup, billing, credits
   and top-up, the allowlist gate, Paddle, abuse email checks) MUST be
   capability-gated so a self-hoster gets a clean, complete product: no dead links,
   no empty billing panels, no "add credits" or signup prompts. The journey rules
   apply to the community first-run too; it points at the SDK/CLI and a real first
   success, never at a paywall.

## Commands

```bash
make build                # controller + forkd binaries
make test-unit            # fork, workspace, vsock unit tests
make test-controller      # envtest suite (needs setup-envtest)
make test-python          # Python SDK tests
make proto                # regenerate gRPC stubs from proto/forkd.proto
make generate manifests   # regenerate deepcopy + CRD YAML after api/ changes
```

- Direct controller tests: `eval $(~/go/bin/setup-envtest use 1.31 -p env) && go test ./internal/controller/`
- Python tests directly: `cd sdk/python && PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m pytest tests/`
- Lint, BOTH invocations are required: `golangci-lint run --timeout=5m` AND `GOOS=linux golangci-lint run --timeout=5m`. Some packages are linux-only and invisible to the darwin run.

## Architecture

- **controller** (`cmd/controller`, `internal/controller`): reconciles SandboxPool, Sandbox, Workspace, WorkspaceRevision; tracks forkd nodes via the NodeRegistry fed by capacity heartbeats.
- **forkd** (`cmd/forkd`, `internal/daemon`): node daemon that owns VMs; gRPC service on :9090 (fork, prepare-pool, heartbeat), HTTP sandbox API on :9091 (exec, files, status).
- **fork engines** (`internal/fork`): the real engine (internal/fork/engine.go) drives Firecracker snapshot/restore and needs KVM; the mock engine (internal/fork/mock.go, KVMAvailable=false) is used by kind e2e and envtest.
- **firecracker client** (`internal/firecracker`): VM lifecycle over the Firecracker API socket.
- **guest agent** (`guest/agent-rs`): PID 1 inside the VM; serves gRPC on vsock port 53 (`internal/vsock` and `internal/guestgrpc` are the host side). The legacy JSON protocol and Go agent are removed (#310).
- **sandbox-server** (`cmd/sandbox-server`): standalone REST API on the same engine, no k8s.
- **Python SDK** (`sdk/python/mitos`): talks to forkd or sandbox-server.

Data paths:

- **Claim path**: controller selects a node from the NodeRegistry, calls forkd `Fork` over gRPC; the claim status endpoint is forkd's HTTP API on that node.
- **Exec path**: SDK -> forkd :9091 -> vsock -> guest agent.

## Coding Conventions

### Punctuation (strict)

Never use em (U+2014) or en (U+2013) dashes anywhere: source, comments, docstrings, Markdown, YAML, CRD descriptions, commit messages, PR descriptions, the GitHub repo description, and release notes. Use only `.` `,` `;` `:` as punctuation connectors. ASCII hyphen-minus (-) is fine for ranges and compound identifiers. If a third-party tool inserts one (release-please, Dependabot), rewrite it before merging.

### Go style
