# Website Reverse-Engineer Template

## What This Is
A reusable template for reverse-engineering any website into a clean, modern Next.js codebase using AI coding agents. The Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 base is pre-scaffolded — just run `/clone-website <url1> [<url2> ...]`.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict)
- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives, Tailwind CSS v4, `cn()` utility)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (default — will be replaced/supplemented by extracted SVGs)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with oklch design tokens
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint check
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript check
- `npm run check` — Run lint + typecheck + build

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- Named exports, PascalCase components, camelCase utils
- Tailwind utility classes, no inline styles
- 2-space indentation
- Responsive: mobile-first

## Design Principles
- **Pixel-perfect emulation** — match the target's spacing, colors, typography exactly
- **No personal aesthetic changes during emulation phase** — match 1:1 first, customize later
- **Real content** — use actual text and assets from the target site, not placeholders
- **Beauty-first** — every pixel matters

## Project Structure
```

  app/              # Next.js routes

    ui/             # shadcn/ui primitives

## MOST IMPORTANT NOTES
- When launching Claude Code agent teams, ALWAYS have each teammate work in their own worktree branch and merge everyone's work at the end, resolving any merge conflicts smartly since you are basically serving the orchestrator role and have full context to our goals, work given, work achieved, and desired outcomes.
- After editing `AGENTS.md`, run `bash scripts/sync-agent-rules.sh` to regenerate platform-specific instruction files.
- After editing `.claude/skills/clone-website/SKILL.md`, run `node scripts/sync-skills.mjs` to regenerate the skill for all platforms.

# Website Inspection Guide

## How to Reverse-Engineer Any Website

This guide outlines what to capture when inspecting a target website via Chrome MCP or browser DevTools.

## Phase 1: Visual Audit

### Screenshots to Capture
- [ ] Every distinct page — desktop, tablet, mobile
- [ ] Dark mode variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Light mode variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Key interaction states (hover, active, open menus, modals)
- [ ] Loading/skeleton states
- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Error states

### Design Tokens to Extract
- [ ] **Colors** — background, text (primary/secondary/muted), accent, border, hover, error, success, warning
- [ ] **Typography** — font family, sizes (h1-h6, body, caption, label), weights, line heights, letter spacing
- [ ] **Spacing** — padding/margin patterns (look for a scale: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- [ ] **Border radius** — buttons, cards, avatars, inputs
- [ ] **Shadows/elevation** — card shadows, dropdown shadows, modal overlay
- [ ] **Breakpoints** — when does the layout shift? (inspect with DevTools responsive mode)
- [ ] **Icons** — which icon library? custom SVGs? sizes?
- [ ] **Avatars** — sizes, shapes, fallback behavior
- [ ] **Buttons** — all variants (primary, secondary, ghost, icon-only, danger)
- [ ] **Inputs** — text fields, textareas, selects, checkboxes, toggles

## Phase 2: Component Inventory

For each distinct UI component, document:
1. **Name** — what would you call this component?
2. **Structure** — what HTML elements / child components does it contain?
3. **Variants** — does it have different sizes, colors, or states?
4. **States** — default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty
5. **Responsive behavior** — how does it change at different breakpoints?
6. **Interactions** — click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation
7. **Animations** — transitions, entrance/exit animations, micro-interactions

### Common Components to Look For
- Navigation (top bar, sidebar, bottom bar)
- Cards / list items
- Buttons and links
- Forms and inputs
- Modals and dialogs
- Dropdowns and menus
- Tabs and segmented controls
- Avatars and user badges
- Loading skeletons
- Toast notifications
- Tooltips and popovers
