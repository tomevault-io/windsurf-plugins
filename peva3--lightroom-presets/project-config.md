# Project: Lightroom Presets (peva3/Lightroom-Presets)

## Overview
48 XMP Lightroom presets across 4 categories:
- **Color Negative** (16): Film stock emulations — Portra, Gold, Ektar, Fuji, etc.
- **Black White** (6): Tri-X, HP5, Delta 3200, Acros, T-Max 3200, Ricoh HC
- **Slide** (4): Kodachrome 64, Velvia 50, Astia 100F, Ektachrome E100
- **Creative** (22): Cinestill, bleach bypass, cyberpunk, VHS, WKW, etc.

## Critical Findings: XMP Color Issues

### The "B&W with one color" bug
Multiple presets were creating a selective-color effect (near-monochrome with one boosted hue). Root causes identified:

1. **Vibrance >> Saturation gap**: When `Vibrance - Saturation > 10`, Lightroom desaturates globally (via Saturation) then selectively boosts midtones (via Vibrance), creating a selective-color effect. **Fix**: Keep Vibrance within 5 points of Saturation, or remove Vibrance entirely.

2. **Calibration panel** (`CalibrationRedHue/Sat`, `CalibrationGreenHue/Sat`, `CalibrationBlueHue/Sat`): The original working XMPs had ZERO calibration values. Adding calibration shifts global primary interpretation, which compounds unpredictably with HSL + split toning. **Fix**: Remove calibration entirely unless absolutely needed.

3. **Temperature/Tint**: Original XMPs had no WB adjustments. Adding WB shifts before HSL/split toning creates color conflicts. **Fix**: Use only for presets where WB is a defining characteristic (e.g., Ultramax's warm cast). Remove from generic film emulations.

4. **Extreme HSL saturation** (> |60|): Nukes entire color channels. **Fix**: Cap at ±60.

### The retuning disaster
The intermediate "retune all 48" commit (`339fe11`) made presets far too aggressive. The fuzzy-merge agents compounded this by adding Calibration, Temperature/Tint, and extreme Vibrance values from aggregated community recipes. The result was presets with 55-68 attributes that looked broken on real photos.

### Original working XMPs (old/ folder)
The `old/` directory contains the reference versions. They are SIMPLE — 8-15 attributes each, no calibration, no WB adjustments, no extreme values. They prioritize subtlety over "pop."

## Research Methodology
- Each preset has `research/{preset}/` with community-recipes.md, characteristics.md, and sometimes datasheet.md / reference-packs.md
- Community values were compiled from Reddit (r/Lightroom, r/postprocessing, r/analog), YouTube, Fuji X Weekly, Mastin Labs, RNI, VSCO
- Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) provides Reddit archival data without rate limits: `https://web.archive.org/web/2025*/https://old.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/search?q=...`
- Reddit's robots.txt blocks Wayback archiving of `/comments/*` and `/search` pages, so most archival attempts return 404

```

## Render Pipeline (`test/render.py`)
Applies XMP presets to RAW/JPEG using rawpy + numpy + scikit-image. Converts crs: attributes to image processing ops. Not a perfect Lightroom match but good for visual iteration. Usage:
```
python3 test/render.py <image> batch [output-dir]
python3 test/render.py <image> "Preset Name" [output.jpg]
```

## Git History
- `4c91f9b`: Initial 30 presets (original working values)
- `4113475`: Moved to subfolders, added TOC/gitignore
- `874d202`: Added 5 Tier 1 presets (Portra 800, Classic Negative, Ultramax 400, VHS, WKW)
- `43c4a15`: Added 13 Tier 2+3 presets (48 total)
- `339fe11`: RETUNE ALL 48 — broke everything with aggressive values
- Latest: Restored original values, applied community fixes

## Mandatory XMP Structural Requirements

Every XMP MUST include these structural elements or Lightroom will render presets flat/washed out:

1. **`crs:ProcessVersion="15.4"`** — Forces modern Camera Raw engine. Older/missing = legacy color matrices.
2. **`crs:Treatment="Color"` or `"Monochrome"`** — Based on directory: Color-Negative/Creative/Slide → Color; Black-White → Monochrome.
3. **`crs:SupportsAmount="True"`** — Must be True, not False.
4. **`<crs:Look>` block** — Camera Profile. Without this, Lightroom skips the non-linear input color matrix:
   - Color presets: `crs:Name="Adobe Color"` with UUID `B952C21111114111B1115456789ABCDE`
   - B&W presets: `crs:Name="Adobe Monochrome"` with UUID `0C09521111114111B1115456789ABCDE`
5. **`<crs:ToneCurvePV2012>`** — All 4 curves (RGB + Red + Green + Blue) set to neutral: `0, 0` → `255, 255`
6. **`<crs:Name>` child element** — Must match `crs:Name` attribute (preset display name), not the Group name.

See `test/rebuild_xmps.py` for the exact template.

## Key Rules for Agents
1. NEVER add Calibration panel values (RedHue/Sat, GreenHue/Sat, BlueHue/Sat, ShadowTint) — they create color channel imbalance. **Exception**: `Canon Color Science` uses calibration as its defining characteristic (emulates Canon's in-camera color science via calibration shifts), so calibration values are allowed there.
