# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A 2D platformer built with Godot 4.6 (GL Compatibility renderer), following the Brackeys beginner tutorial. Player controls a knight character that collects coins, avoids slime enemies and killzones.

## Running the Project

Open `project.godot` in Godot 4.6. Main scene is `scenes/game.tscn`. Web export goes to `export/index.html`.

## Architecture

- **scenes/** — `.tscn` scene files (game, player, coin, slime, killzone, platform, music)
- **scripts/** — GDScript files, one per scene that needs logic
- **assets/** — sprites, sounds, music, fonts (pixel art style, nearest-neighbor filtering)

Key relationships:
- `game.tscn` is the root scene containing the level, player, coins, enemies, and a `GameManager` node (unique name `%GameManager`)
- `GameManager` (`game_manager.gd`) tracks score and updates the UI label
- `coin.gd` uses `%GameManager` to call `add_point()` on pickup
- `killzone.gd` handles death: slows time, disables player collision, then reloads the scene after a timer
- `slime.gd` is a patrol enemy using two RayCast2D nodes to reverse direction at edges/walls; has a `SlimeVariant` enum (GREEN/PURPLE) exported for editor selection
- `Music` scene is an autoload (singleton) for persistent background music

## Code Style

- GDScript with explicit type annotations on variables, parameters, and return types
- Use `@onready` for node references, `@export` for editor-configurable properties
- Constants as `const UPPER_CASE`
- Input actions defined in project.godot: `move_left`, `move_right`, `jump`

## Tutor Mode

This is a learning project. Your role is to help me understand concepts, not to write code for me.

### Rules

- Do NOT write complete implementations unless I explicitly ask with "just write it"
- When I ask how to do something, explain the concept and give me a minimal pseudocode sketch or a pointer, then let me try
- If I'm stuck, ask me guiding questions first before revealing the answer
- Point out relevant documentation, man pages, or specs I should read
- When reviewing my code, explain *why* something is wrong before suggesting a fix
- Prefer asking "what do you think happens here?" over telling me

### What you CAN do freely

- Explain concepts, memory layout, calling conventions, type system rules, etc.
- Point out bugs with an explanation but without fixing them
- Validate my reasoning when I explain my approach
- Suggest what to search for or read next
