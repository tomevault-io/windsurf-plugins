# Agent Instructions

## Changelog

This repository uses Changesets to generate package changelogs.

- Add a changeset in `.changeset/` for every user-facing change, package dependency change, CLI behavior change, or release-worthy bug fix.
- Use `patch` for fixes and dependency maintenance, and `minor` for new features or pre-1.0 breaking changes.
- Do not add `major` changesets for now. A major changeset would trigger the 1.0 release and requires explicit approval.
- Keep changeset summaries concise and written for AgentPond users.
- Do not manually edit generated changelog output unless the release process has already run `pnpm changeset version`.

## AgentPond Skill

- Keep `skills/agentpond/SKILL.md` and `skills/agentpond/references/cli.md` in sync with CLI behavior changes.
- When a PR changes commands, flags, prompts, environment variables, or storage setup, update the skill in the same PR.

## Provider, Project, and Environment Context

- A provider is the static platform adapter registered by the CLI. It supplies platform metadata and opens a detected provider project from the current directory. Opening a project may succeed before the project is fully linked or configured.
- A provider project is the project-bound handle returned by `provider.openProject()`. It owns the detected root and setup label, persistent environment selection, and environment resolution, so commands do not repeatedly pass `cwd` through unrelated provider methods.
- An environment context is the resolved, per-command data-access state for one selected environment. It contains the project root, AgentPond configuration, local cache path, and lazy object-storage resolution. Resolving one may require provider-specific linking or configuration.
- Keep the CLI provider registry, supported-platform parsing, and provider setup selection in `apps/cli/src/providers.ts`. Do not add provider-specific branches to `apps/cli/src/environment-context.ts`.
- Use the provider registry to open a provider project for setup and for rejecting provider-managed projects before full resolution. Use the project handle for environment selection and use an environment context for commands that need resolved cache or storage state.

## Duplicate Code

- Use the `$dry-refactoring` skill when analyzing or fixing duplicate-code findings.

## Commits

- Use the normal `git commit` path so Husky pre-commit hooks run.
- Never use `git commit --no-verify` for commits in this repository.
- Never disable Git hooks with `HUSKY=0` or equivalent environment overrides for commits in this repository.
- If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue and retry the normal `git commit`; do not bypass the hook.
- If a hook changes files, review and stage those hook updates before committing again.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **agentpond** (1417 symbols, 3349 relationships, 112 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
