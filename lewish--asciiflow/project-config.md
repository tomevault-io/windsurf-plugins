# ASCIIFlow

ASCII diagram drawing web app (asciiflow.com). Client-side only, also runs as Electron desktop app.

## Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript 5.8
- **UI:** React 16.14.0 + Material-UI 4.12.4
- **Routing:** React Router DOM 5.3.4
- **Build:** Bazel 8 (via Bazelisk) + esbuild (via aspect_rules_esbuild)
- **Tests:** Mocha + Chai + Sinon (unit), Playwright (e2e)
- **Desktop:** Electron 29.0.1

## Build & Dev

```bash
bazel build client:bundle      # Production build (esbuild)
bazel build client:site         # Full site with static assets
bazel test //common:all         # Common tests only
bazel test //client:all         # Client tests only
bazel test //e2e:all            # Playwright e2e tests
```

Requires Node 22.x (managed by Bazel toolchain) and Bazel 8.x (via Bazelisk).

## Architecture

- **State:** Zustand store (`client/store/index.ts`). `Store` is a singleton. React components subscribe via Zustand's `useStore()` hook with selectors.
- **Drawing:** Command pattern — Controller dispatches input to the active `IDrawFunction` tool. Tools write to a scratch `Layer`, which is applied on commit.
- **Layers:** Sparse grid (`Map<string, string>` keyed by Vector). `LayerView` composes multiple layers for rendering.
- **Persistence:** Direct `localStorage.getItem`/`setItem` with `IStringifier` serialization (in store/index.ts and store/canvas.ts).
- **Sharing:** Drawing → JSON → pako deflate → base64 → URL param at `/share/:encoded`.
- **Routes:** `/` (new), `/local/:id` (saved), `/share/:encoded` (shared read-only).

## Conventions

- TypeScript with strict type checking
- React functional components with hooks
- Bazel BUILD files per directory
- Unit tests use `.spec.ts` suffix alongside source files
- E2e tests use `.spec.js` in `e2e/` directory
- Path alias: `#asciiflow/*` maps to repo root
- CSS modules for component styling
- Drawing tools implement `IDrawFunction` with: `start()`, `move()`, `end()`, `handleKey()`, `getCursor()`
