# `@verrex/core/vite` — Vite integration for `.vx`

Tiny plugin (~70 LOC). Responsible for getting `.vx` files through
Vite's dev pipeline as if they were `.ts` files.

Public surface: `export function verrex(): Plugin` (also `default`).
The user adds it to their `vite.config.ts` plugins array.

## What it does

The plugin **owns the full `.vx` → JavaScript transform** and hands
Vite finished JS. It does _not_ lean on Vite's built-in transformer to
strip the TypeScript — see "Why we own the whole transform" below.

Three hooks, each load-bearing:

| Hook                                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enforce: "pre"`                     | Run before other plugins' transforms so our hook is the one that turns a `.vx` id into a module. If you drop the flag and something breaks, ordering is the first thing to check.                                                                                              |
| `configureServer(server)` middleware | Rewrites every `.vx` request URL to add `?import` (if not already present).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `transform(code, id)`                | Two steps: (1) `transformVerrex(code, id, { errorRecovery: false })` turns JSX into `h()` calls (still TypeScript); (2) Vite's `transformWithOxc(ts, id, { lang: "ts" }, babelMap)` strips the types → JS and chains the Babel map. Returns `{ code, map, moduleType: "js" }`. |
| `load(id)`                           | Reads the raw file from disk for `?import`-suffixed requests. Belt-and-suspenders — the middleware ensures every `.vx` request hits this path.                                                                                                                                 |

## Why we own the whole transform (Vite 8 / Oxc)

The plugin type-strips in-house and returns plain JS rather than riding
Vite's built-in transformer — that coupling is fragile (it snapped in
Vite 8's esbuild → Oxc swap), and Rolldown infers a module's language
from its extension, which fails on the unknown `.vx`:

- `transformWithOxc(tsCode, id, { lang: "ts" }, babelMap)` — Vite 8's
  exported Oxc transform. `lang: "ts"` tells Oxc the post-Babel code is
  TypeScript (it can't infer that from the `.vx` id); the 4th arg
  `inMap` chains the Babel `.vx` → TS map so the returned map resolves
  to the original `.vx`.
- `moduleType: "js"` on the result tells Rolldown the output is plain
  JavaScript, so it never runs lang-detection on the `.vx` id.

This keeps the plugin **bundler-agnostic**, and the same `transform`
runs in dev and build.

### Build vs. editor error policy

`transformVerrex`'s default `errorRecovery: true` lets the editor tolerate
mid-edit unparseable source (see [`@verrex/core/compiler`](../compiler/AGENTS.md)).
The build path passes **`errorRecovery: false`** so a genuine syntax
error throws here — a Vite error overlay in dev, a failed build in CI —
instead of the compiler silently recovering and us shipping a broken
module. Vite (not tsc) is the only checker on the build path, so this
plugin is where "fail loudly on bad syntax" has to live.

## Why the URL-rewrite middleware exists

Without the `?import` middleware, a direct browser GET for
`/src/Counter.vx` hits Vite's **static-asset middleware**, which
returns the file with empty `Content-Type`. Localhost is lenient
about that; real browsers under strict-MIME (including any
non-localhost origin like LAN) reject it.

Adding `?import` routes the same URL through Vite's **module
pipeline** where the `transform` hook fires, the result is
JavaScript, and `Content-Type: text/javascript` is set
correctly. Strict-MIME accepts that.

Every `.vx` URL gets `?import` appended (preserving any existing
query), so every request — first load, HMR cache-bust re-fetch
(`?t=<ts>`), ES-module subgraph fetch (`import "./Counter.vx"` from an
already-loaded module) — goes through the module path. The latter two
never touch HTML, which is why HTML rewriting can't do this job (see
Anti-patterns). If you find yourself "fixing" this by removing the
middleware, test HMR after an edit AND test from a non-localhost
origin before declaring it unnecessary.

## Regex notes

The plugin defines three nearly-identical regexes:

- `VERREX_RE` — for the `transform` hook (`/\.vx(?:\?[^.]*)?$/`):
  matches the path with optional query, used to gate transforms.
- `VERREX_PATH_RE` — for the `load` hook (`/\.vx$/`): matches the
  path _after_ `id.split("?")[0]`, so no query handling needed.
- `VERREX_URL_RE` — for the URL middleware (`/\.vx(\?.*)?$/`):
