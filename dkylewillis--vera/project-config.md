# Using VERA as an AI agent

This file teaches AI coding agents how to use VERA to retrieve context from documents.

## What is an `.vera` file?

A single SQLite vector database containing ready-made chunks, JSON metadata,
pre-computed embeddings, and optional opaque attachments. Extraction may record
pages, headings, figures, and regions as metadata or attachments. You can search
it instantly — no parsing, chunking, embedding API calls, or retrieval service. See
[docs/vera-spec-v0.2.md](docs/vera-spec-v0.2.md) for the current format specification.

## Quick reference

All one-shot commands support `--json` for machine-readable output on stdout.
`vera mcp` is a long-running stdio server and does not accept `--json`.

```bash
# Search a document (hybrid = semantic + keyword, best default)
vera search manual.vera "stormwater detention requirements" --top-k 5 --json

# Search a folder of .vera files as one corpus (results include "file")
vera search ./library "stormwater detention requirements" --top-k 5 --json

# Search nested folders directly, or build a persistent local library index
vera search ./library "stormwater detention requirements" --recursive --json
vera index build ./library --recursive --json
vera index update ./library --json
vera index status ./library --json

# Include figure/table metadata near each result
vera search manual.vera "pipe sizing chart" --json --figures

# Include adjacent text context around each hit
vera search manual.vera "stormwater detention requirements" --json --context-chunks 1

# Keyword-only or semantic-only search
vera search manual.vera "section 4.2" --mode keyword --json
vera search manual.vera "how big should the pond be" --mode semantic --json

# Include highlight regions (page + bounding boxes) for visual grounding
vera search manual.vera "detention requirements" --json --regions

# Export the original source document (e.g. the PDF) back out
vera export manual.vera exported.pdf --json

# What's in this file?
vera inspect manual.vera --json

# Is this file well-formed? (exit code 0 = valid, 1 = invalid)
vera validate manual.vera --json

# Create an .vera from a PDF
vera convert manual.pdf manual.vera --json

# Batch-convert a nested PDF library beside its source files
vera convert ./proposals --recursive --json
```

Conversion selectively OCRs image-based low-text pages through PyMuPDF and
Tesseract with bundled English data (`--ocr auto|off|force`,
`--ocr-language`, `--ocr-dpi`) and publishes a validated temporary sibling
atomically. PDFs with no searchable chunks after OCR fail with an OCR-specific
message. Directory conversion validates existing outputs before skipping them
and reports malformed archives in `malformed_existing`.

### Search result shape (`--json`)

```json
{
  "query": "stormwater detention requirements",
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "results": [
    {
      "chunk_id": "chunk_0042",
      "score": 0.91,
      "page_start": 117,
      "page_end": 118,
      "heading_path": "Chapter 4 > 4.2 Detention Design",
      "source_filename": "manual.pdf",
      "document_id": "document_0001",
      "text": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Directory searches add `file` to each result and a top-level `index` status
object. They also add top-level `skipped_files` diagnostics for malformed
archives excluded from the search and `skipped_semantic_model_groups` for
indexed model groups omitted because the query embedder was unavailable or
dimension-incompatible. Result order is the rank; the CLI does not emit a
`rank` field.

## Rules for agents

1. **Always cite sources.** Every result includes `page_start`/`page_end` and
   `heading_path`. Quote them when answering from a document, e.g.
   *"(p. 117, Chapter 4 > 4.2 Detention Design)"*.
2. **Prefer `--mode hybrid`** (the default). Use `keyword` only for exact phrases,
   IDs, or section numbers; use `semantic` for paraphrased natural-language questions.
3. **Use `--figures`** when the question involves tables, charts, diagrams, or maps —
   results gain a `figures` array with captions and page locations.
4. **Use `--context-chunks N`** when an answer needs surrounding prose — results gain
  `before_chunks` and `after_chunks` arrays with citation-ready neighboring chunks.
5. **Use `--regions`** when a viewer needs to highlight where a chunk came from —
   results gain a `regions` array of
   `{block_id, page_number, bbox, page_width, page_height}` (bbox in page points,
   origin top-left).
6. **Check exit codes.** Parse stdout as JSON on exit 0. `validate`, `index status`,
   `eval`, and a failed `export` can also print a structured JSON report on exit 1;
   most missing-path/runtime errors instead write an unstructured traceback to stderr.
7. **Don't read the SQLite file directly** unless the CLI is unavailable — the schema
   is documented in the spec, but the CLI/MCP tools are the stable interface.

For the complete reusable workflow, load [skills/vera/SKILL.md](skills/vera/SKILL.md).
Its [CLI reference](skills/vera/references/cli-reference.md) documents every flag,
JSON shape, exit code, and filesystem side effect. See
[docs/agent-skills.md](docs/agent-skills.md) to install the skill in Hermes,
OpenClaw, Cursor, or another Agent Skills client.
