# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Roadmap

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the full skills roadmap: which skills are done (✅), which are next (⭐ Priority), and the recommended implementation order.

## What This Repository Is

A collection of **Claude Code agent skills** for data engineering topics. Skills are loaded by the Claude Agent SDK harness at runtime to give Claude specialized domain knowledge and behavioral rules for a specific technology or task. There is no build system, test runner, or application code — the repository is purely documentation-as-skills.

## Repository Layout

```
skills/<name>/SKILL.md      — skill definitions consumed by the agent harness
docs/specs/<name>.md        — detailed enterprise specs referenced by skills
guides/<name>.md            — tutorial-style narrative guides (Russian, for humans)
```

Skills, specs, and guides are related but serve different audiences:
- `skills/` — concise, prescriptive instruction files loaded directly into the agent context.
- `docs/specs/` — verbose enterprise specifications with deep rationale; skills cross-reference these.
- `guides/` — human-readable tutorials written in Russian that synthesize the specs.

## Skill File Format

Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: <kebab-case-slug>
description: <one-sentence trigger description used by the harness to decide when to load this skill>
---

# <Title>

## When to Use
...
```

The `description` field is the most critical part — the harness uses it to match user intent to the right skill. Keep it specific and keyword-rich so it activates on the right requests and not on unrelated ones.

A skill must be self-contained: it cannot assume other skills are loaded simultaneously. Cross-references to `docs/specs/` are allowed in a "References to Consult When Needed" section at the bottom.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — follow the structure of an existing skill such as `skills/spark_sql/SKILL.md`.
2. Include these sections in order: **When to Use**, **Core Workflow** (or equivalent), technology-specific content sections, **Anti-Patterns**, **Output Expectations**, optionally **References to Consult When Needed**.
3. Write in English.
4. Make examples production-quality — not toy snippets.
