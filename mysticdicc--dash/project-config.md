# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- User prefers direct, solution-focused responses and wants their observed runtime/UI behavior treated as authoritative when debugging CSS issues.
- Always check all relevent files as you have access to all files being dicussed in the solution.
- Also follow through methods and inspect their relevent class files to see how they are implemented and if that has any impact.
- Use web search if necessary to look up relevent documentation about the subject.
- Check things before you say them, for example do not say "you have said x is okay", check the file again and see if x is actually okay or if there is still an issue with it.
- If I am referencing a current application issue, try to fetch debug logs to find clues. Even if I say I cannot see any logs for the issues, you are an LLM you are better at analysing large dumps of log files than me.
- You should literally never be asking me to paste parts of files or show you files, just get them and look at them if you are going to reccomend I get you bits of them to look at anyway.
- I never want to use the modernization agent process, do not suggest it.
- Do not include comments in your code examples, if you need to explain something about a specific line of code extract it into the chat and explain it. Do not use comments.
