# AGENTS.md on first visit

When working in this product (Pi Desktop agent sessions) or implementing related behavior:

- If the project directory has `AGENTS.md` (or `AGENTS.MD`), the agent **must** read and follow it on the **first visit / first turn** in that workspace.
- Prefer content already injected under `<project_context>` / `<project_instructions>` (Pi SDK loads these into the system prompt). Treat that as already read — do not ignore it.
- If the file exists on disk but is missing from context, call `read` on `AGENTS.md` before broad exploration or large changes.
- Do not skip `AGENTS.md` in favor of guessing project conventions from the tree alone.
