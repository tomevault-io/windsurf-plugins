# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository contains small, focused Go concurrency examples for practice, learning, and interview preparation.

Each example should remain:
- self-contained
- easy to read
- correct under concurrent access
- backed by automated tests

## Tech Stack

- Go 1.22+
- Standard library first

## Project Structure

- `examples/<example>/`
  - reusable package code and package tests
- `README.md`
  - high-level project overview and example list

## Implementation Guidelines

- Keep each example package focused on one problem or concurrency pattern.
- Prefer clear standard-library concurrency primitives such as:
  - goroutines
  - channels
  - `context`
  - `sync`
  - `sync/atomic`
- Favor correctness and readability over cleverness.
- Keep APIs minimal and idiomatic for Go.
- Use descriptive package names without underscores or hyphens.
- Return errors instead of panicking for normal failure paths.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies for small examples.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Add Go doc comments for every exported package, type, function, method, const, var, and exported struct field.
- Start doc comments with the identifier being documented, such as `Pool` or `Acquire`.
- Keep comments concise and useful; explain the caller-facing purpose before implementation mechanics.
- In package comments, include the business logic first so readers understand the example's scenario. Then describe the concurrency techniques used, why those techniques fit the example, and what benefits they provide, such as correctness, bounded concurrency, cancellation, predictable handoff, or avoiding wasted work.
- Prefer business or caller language first, such as jobs, batches, resources, success, failure, and cancellation. Mention goroutines, channels, locks, or other implementation details only when they affect how callers use the API.
- For concurrency examples, document concurrency safety, blocking behavior, cancellation behavior, channel ownership, zero-value behavior, invalid inputs, and returned errors when relevant.
- Put package comments in one file per package, usually `doc.go` for packages with more than one source file.

## Testing Guidelines

- Every new example should include dedicated `go test` coverage.
- Add a short comment above each `Test...` function explaining the caller-facing behavior or guarantee being verified.
- Tests should validate normal behavior, edge cases, and concurrency coordination behavior.
- Prefer deterministic tests over timing-sensitive tests.
- Use short timeout-based guards only to prevent a hung test.
- After changes, run:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## README Maintenance

- Update `README.md` when adding a new example.
- Keep the implemented example table in sync with the repository.
- In the implemented example table, use one `What it demonstrates` column that combines the business use case with precise Go concurrency terms.
- Keep the implemented example table ordered from simpler concurrency building blocks to examples that combine multiple coordination techniques. When adding an example, insert it where it best fits by complexity and technique, rather than appending it automatically.
- Keep the short overview list near the top of `README.md` consistent with the implemented example order.
