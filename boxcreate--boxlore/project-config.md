# PR impact labels (required + optional)

Every `boxlore` PR must have **exactly one** user-impact label. `backend-change` is optional and **pairable** with any level.

**Changelog / README upcoming workflows read these labels** — do not open a PR without the user-impact level. See also [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## User impact (pick one)

| Label | Meaning | README / notification |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `user-impact-high` | Listeners clearly notice | Always prioritize |
| `user-impact-medium` | Noticeable, not headline | Include |
| `user-impact-low` | Minor user-facing | CHANGELOG; README if space |
| `no-user-impact` | No listener-facing change | CHANGELOG only |

## Backend (optional, pairable)

| Label | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `backend-change` | Server / proxy / infra involved — add alongside any user-impact level |

Examples:

- `--label user-impact-high --label backend-change`
- `--label no-user-impact --label backend-change`
- `--label user-impact-medium`

## Merge gate — required before merge

There is **no `merge-ci` label flow** and **no merge queue**. Unit CI (detekt / ktlint / Kover) runs on **every PR push**, plus optional `workflow_dispatch`. A new commit cancels any in-progress unit run for that PR.

Master is protected by a branch ruleset. Required checks:

| Check | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `testDebugUnitTest` | Full unit / static / Kover gate (PR; cancels prior run on new commit) |
| `coderabbit-threads-resolved` | Every non-outdated CodeRabbit review thread is Resolved |

Still run on PRs (not ruleset-required): SonarCloud App, CodeRabbit App status, Gitleaks.

Agent / maintainer flow:

1. Open and iterate the PR (unit suite cancels prior runs; Sonar/CodeRabbit/Gitleaks also run).
2. Wait for **`testDebugUnitTest`** and **`coderabbit-threads-resolved`** green.
3. Address **every** CodeRabbit finding and mark each CodeRabbit thread **Resolved**. After resolving without a push, re-run **CodeRabbit Threads Resolved** (`workflow_dispatch` with `pr_number`).
4. If review decision is **`CHANGES_REQUESTED`**: **stop** — do not dismiss, do not merge. Ask the user to merge (or dismiss) manually.
5. Otherwise squash-merge the PR when required checks are green.
6. Optional: Actions → Run workflow (`Unit Tests`) for a manual full gate.

**Title skips (when appropriate only):**

- `[skip unit]` in the PR title — no-ops the unit suite on PR (still reports green). **Only** for safe docs/chore with no logic risk.
- `[skip changelog]` — skips changelog-on-merge (e.g. `release: vX.Y.Z [skip changelog]`).

**Bot bypass:** **boxlore-master-pusher** (GitHub App 4340323) and organization admins bypass the ruleset so scheduled workflows can push chore commits to `master` directly. Never remove that Integration bypass.

Do **not** hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or README Upcoming / What's New marker regions before merge — changelog-on-merge owns those (labels help prioritize README / notifications).

## PR title (required)

Use Conventional Commits only:

- `feat(scope): …` / `fix(scope): …` / `chore: …` / `docs: …` / `release: vX.Y.Z [skip changelog]`
- Never open or leave a PR with a sentence-case title (e.g. `Polish the announcement dialog`).

## Agent checklist

1. Before `gh pr create`, set a Conventional Commit title and choose exactly one of `user-impact-high|medium|low` or `no-user-impact`.
2. Add `backend-change` when the PR also touches backend/proxy/infra.
3. Do not open a PR without a user-impact level label.
4. Never apply two user-impact level labels on the same PR.
5. If the label is `user-impact-high` or `user-impact-medium`, the PR body **must** include **Listener impact → What changes in the user’s life** in plain listener language (not just engineering bullets). Skip that section only for `user-impact-low` or `no-user-impact`.
6. If a PR title violates Conventional Commits, rename it with `gh pr edit <n> --title "type(scope): …"` before merge.
7. Before merging: confirm **`testDebugUnitTest`** + **`coderabbit-threads-resolved`** are green, every CodeRabbit thread is Resolved, and review decision is **not** `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. If it is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, stop and ask the user to merge manually.
