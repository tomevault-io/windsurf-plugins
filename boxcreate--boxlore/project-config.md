# P1 / large refactor hard-stop

For large refactors, multi-file architecture moves, or batched P1 Critical issue cleanup:

## Phase 1 — proposal only

1. List the issues / scope in plain English.
2. Describe the proposed fix and helper splits.
3. Call out risk and blast radius (affected files).
4. **Hard stop.** Do not create branches or edit product code until the user explicitly approves (e.g. “OK”).

## After approval

Follow the normal agent loop: isolated branch if needed, update dependents, compile, module README + unit tests, `installDebug` for UI, commit/push/PR **only when asked**. PR labels and merge queue: [`.cursor/rules/pr-impact-labels.mdc`](pr-impact-labels.mdc).
