# Architecture (always)

Full reference: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md). **ARCHITECTURE wins** over guesses.

## Composition root

- No Hilt, Koin, or Dagger. Single `AppContainer` in `:app` (created only in `BoxLoreApplication`).
- Features and workers take deps from `application.container` / assemblers / ports — do not build a second object graph.
- Prefer narrow ports under `core.domain.ports` (and catalog ports) so tests can use fakes from `:core:testing`.

## Module boundaries

- `:feature:*` → `:core:*` only. **No feature→feature** Gradle deps or package imports (Konsist).
- Features never talk to PostHog directly — use `:core:analytics`.
- `:core:playback` may depend on `:core:catalog`; catalog must not depend on playback.
- Catalog must not depend on `:core:designsystem`.
- Do not add MockK (or Hilt/Koin) to production or test Gradle deps (Konsist).

## Identity / storage (do not break upgrades)

Before renaming prefs files, Room DBs, media IDs, deep links, WorkManager FQCNs, or `applicationId`, read the **Identity and storage** table in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Hard product rules agents forget:

- One UI-scoped `PlaybackRepository` — routes/workers must not construct a second one.
- Smart Queue refill is owned by `BoxLorePlaybackService` only.
- Object graph order: DB → `PodcastRepository` → `QueueRepository` → `PlaybackRepository` → `QueueManager` → `SmartDownloadManager`.

## Guards

Architecture-as-code lives in `:core:testing` (Konsist + filesystem guards). Fix violations; do not weaken allowlists without an explicit reason and README note.
