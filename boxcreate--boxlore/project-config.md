# Agent Guardrails

## Verification Constraints

Never perform automated testing, layout tree dumps (e.g. Android layout), gesture simulations (e.g. `adb shell input tap/swipe`), screen captures, or other device/emulator verifications unless the user explicitly requests it.

Only build and/or deploy the application, and let the user verify behavior manually.

**After code changes:** Always run `./gradlew installDebug` on the connected device when one is available. Do not wait for the user to ask — install is part of the default workflow for UI and app-behavior changes.

## Credentials and Secrets Safety

**Secret locations:**
- Proxy header authorization key: `local.properties` (boxlore root) as `BOXCAST_PUBLIC_KEY` (sent as `X-App-Key`)
- Most other credentials: `local.properties` (boxlore) or `.env` (proxy)

**Absolute non-commitment:** Under no circumstances commit `local.properties`, `.env`, or any plaintext secrets/credentials to Git.

## Test and Scratch File Purge

Delete all test scripts, mock JSONs, scratch files, and intermediate logs once the feature PR is completed.

## CodeRabbit / merge

- Address every CodeRabbit finding and mark **every** CodeRabbit review thread **Resolved** before merge. Hard gate: required check `coderabbit-threads-resolved`.
- If the PR review decision is **`CHANGES_REQUESTED`**: **stop**. Do not dismiss the review. Do not enqueue or force merge. Ask the user to merge (or dismiss) manually.
