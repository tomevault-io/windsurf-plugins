# Cursor Rule: Prevent God-Objects and Giant Files

Use this as a **hard project rule** for Cursor (and for any future AI edits).

---

## Prime Directive

**Never grow a “god-object” file.**

If a file is becoming a central dumping ground (routing + policy + execution + parsing + state), you must split it into focused modules **before** adding more features.

---

## Hard Limits (non-negotiable)

### 1) File size limit

* **Max target:** 500 lines per file.
* **Absolute max:** 800 lines.

If a change would push a file over 800 lines, Cursor must:

1. Stop adding features to that file.
2. Extract new code into a new file/module.
3. Update the calling file to delegate.

**Exception:** auto-generated files only (must be clearly marked and excluded).

### 2) One responsibility per file

A file may own **exactly one** of these responsibilities:

* Routing / intent classification
* Policy gating / permissions
* Tool execution loop
* Deterministic utilities
* Memory retrieval / merge
* Guardrails / reasoning pipeline coordination
* UI / lifecycle / wiring

If a file begins owning 2+ responsibilities, Cursor must split it.

---

## “God-Object” Smell Tests

If any are true, refactor immediately (no debate):

* The file imports modules from 3+ distinct subsystems (e.g., routing + memory + tool runner + UI).
* The file contains 3+ distinct sections separated by large comment banners.
* A single class has 10+ methods or 10+ private fields.
* The class name contains words like *Orchestrator*, *Manager*, *Coordinator* **and** it implements business logic instead of delegating.

---

## Required Architecture Pattern

### The Orchestrator Rule

The orchestrator/coordinator file must be **thin**:

* It may perform sequencing and response assembly.
* It may not contain regex heuristics, parsing logic, routing decisions, policy rules, or tool loop mechanics.

All logic must live behind interfaces:

* `IRouter`
* `IPolicyGate`
* `IToolLoopExecutor`
* `IMemoryContextProvider`
* `IGuardrailsCoordinator`
* `IDeterministicUtilityEngine`

Orchestrator may only call these modules.

---

## Cursor Execution Instructions

When implementing a new feature:

1. Identify which module owns the responsibility.
2. Add or extend code **only** in that module.
3. If no module exists, create one.
4. Keep changes to the orchestrator limited to wiring + delegation.

---

## Enforcement Checklist (must pass before completing a PR)

* No file exceeded 800 lines (excluding generated).
* Any file above 500 lines was justified or split.
* Orchestrator contains no feature logic beyond sequencing.
* New feature came with module-level unit tests.

---

## The “Stop Work” Clause

If Cursor cannot implement a feature without violating these rules, it must:

* Stop.
* Propose a split plan (new files + interfaces).
* Then proceed once the split is done.
