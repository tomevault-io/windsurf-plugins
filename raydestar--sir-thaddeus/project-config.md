# Sir Thaddeus Agent Guide

## Scope

Apply this guide to the entire repository. Treat more-specific `AGENTS.md`
files, when present, as additional instructions for their directory only.

## Product objective

Sir Thaddeus is a local-first assistant intended to show that a small model can
complete a large share of ordinary work when deterministic capabilities,
memory, permissions, tools, and observable verification are used well.

Keep two claims separate:

- **Model capacity:** closed-book knowledge and reasoning, measured with MMLU
  and related controls.
- **Harness capability:** successful user outcomes created by tools, retrieval,
  state, permissions, and external verification.

Do not substitute one score for the other. State the primary metric before an
experiment begins. Preserve raw-model language quality while improving product
capability.

Track **product quality** as a third, independent scorecard: latency, safety,
personality, continuity, validity, permissions, false success, and resource use.
Changing to a larger or newer model may be a useful deployment comparison, but
it is not evidence that the harness improved the fixed model under test.

## Required orientation

Before changing assistant behavior, read:

1. `docs/ASSISTANT_PIPELINE.md` for the supported production path and retired
   experiments.
2. `docs/EXPERIMENTATION.md` for benchmark and promotion policy.
3. `docs/TESTING.md` for the narrowest trustworthy verification command.

For optimization work, also read `docs/CALIBRATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` and the
current evidence in `docs/research/` before selecting a candidate.

Use `THADDEUS_ROUTING_LATENCY_SCOPE.md` as historical evidence, not as the
current architecture contract. Verify drift-prone claims against current code,
GitHub state, and fresh artifacts.

When available, use the `sir-thaddeus-experiment-loop` skill for MMLU, harness,
prompt, routing, model-comparison, latency, VRAM, or benchmark work.

## Production invariants

- Preserve safety boundaries, personality, memory, dialogue continuity,
  permissions, tool policy, auditing, sanitization, and explicit response
  contracts unless the task explicitly changes one of them.
- Keep desktop and headless behavior aligned.
- Keep benchmark datasets, expected answers, suite identifiers, scorer logic,
  and promotion thresholds outside production assemblies.
- Prefer a generalized fix at the narrowest product seam over a broad rewrite.
- Do not retain rejected behavior behind a disabled flag. Remove it.
- Treat external tools and model providers as untrusted boundaries.

## Experiment contract

- Change one mechanism per experimental branch.
- Predeclare the hypothesis, controls, primary metric, guardrails, time budget,
  promotion threshold, and rollback before running the candidate.
- Compare the candidate with both the raw-model control and the unchanged
  Thaddeus control under the same model and sampling configuration.
- Use a development slice of roughly ten minutes or less for rejection and
  iteration. A small development win is not promotion evidence.
- Treat ten minutes as a ceiling, not a target. Use deterministic checks and a
  balanced reject-only triage slice before the full development battery, and
  record the planned case-evaluation count before making model calls.
- Reject a clearly losing candidate immediately. If it wins or reaches the
  exact-repeat gate with a credible directional improvement, retain it long
  enough to rerun the exact candidate.
- Use a disjoint frozen validation set only after the exact repeat succeeds.
- Run broad product regressions only after the candidate survives the focused
  gates.
- Require explicit large-campaign acknowledgement before multi-model, repeated,
  validation, or confirmation sweeps. Reuse compatible frozen controls only
  when hashes match and a small unchanged-harness sentinel shows no drift.
- Record correctness, validity, paired wins/losses, model calls, tokens,
  latency, peak memory/VRAM, and escalation or tool-use rates when applicable.
- Delete clearly non-working implementation branches, but preserve their
  manifests, raw artifacts, and verdicts in the experiment record. A candidate
  that reaches exact repeat or validation may remain as a labeled, unmerged
  research branch until the campaign decision; do not keep it as dormant
  production code or imply that retention is promotion.
- Treat every material mutation after a failed run as a new candidate. Do not
  tune repeatedly against a holdout until one run happens to pass.

## Benchmark integrity

- Never add task IDs, fixture names, expected-answer fragments, subject-specific
  answer keys, scorer imports, or benchmark-aware conditionals to runtime code.
- Do not read hidden expected outputs or scoring predicates while optimizing
  product behavior. Inspect raw model outputs, traces, tool results, and public
  task inputs instead.
- Do not weaken thresholds, rewrite expected answers, or make scoring more
  lenient to promote a candidate.
- Use semantic mutations, renamed tools/arguments, changed numbers/entities,
  paraphrases, irrelevant-tool distractors, and temporal holdouts to test
  generalization.
- Keep stronger-model calls visible. Report them as escalation, not local-model
