# Reqvire Development Guide

## System Overview
Reqvire is an AI-driven framework for system modeling and requirements management that integrates with Git workflows. It processes semi-structured Markdown documents containing system requirements, manages relationships between elements, validates model consistency, and generates documentation and visualizations.

## MBSE Development Workflow

**CRITICAL**: This is a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) project. Always follow this workflow:

1. **Requirements First**: Before implementing any new capability, add requirements to the specifications with proper traceability
2. **Verifications**: Define how the capability will be verified before implementation
3. **Tests**: Create tests to satisfy verifications (can be refined during implementation if needed)
4. **Implementation**: Only after requirements and verifications are defined, implement the code
5. **Satisfaction Links**: Link implementation to `requirement` elements (and test-verifications) via satisfiedBy relations

**Never skip the requirements step.** Implementation without requirements violates the MBSE methodology and project principles.

## Domain-Specific Guides

This guide is split into domain-specific guides for better organization:

- **[tests/CLAUDE.md](tests/CLAUDE.md)** - Guide for writing and executing end-to-end tests
- **Core Development** (see sections below) - Guide for Rust code development, architecture, and components

## Building and Running Reqvire

### Basic cargo Commands
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run with HTML output: `cargo run -- specifications output --html`
- Run specific commands: `cargo run -- format` or `./target/debug/reqvire format`
- Test: `cargo test`
- Test specific: `cargo test <test_name>`
- Lint: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- Format: `cargo fmt`

### Development Commands

**For working with specifications, use the Reqvire skills:**
- `reqvire:syseng` - System and requirements engineering
- `reqvire:task-master` - Task planning from requirement changes

#### Essential Development Commands
- **Validate**: `./target/debug/reqvire validate [--json]`
- **Format**: `./target/debug/reqvire format [--fix]`
- **Search**: `./target/debug/reqvire search [--json] [--short] [--filter-*]`
- **Export**: `./target/debug/reqvire export --output <DIR>`
- **Serve**: `./target/debug/reqvire serve --port 8080`

For comprehensive command reference, see the Reqvire skills.

### Key File Locations
- Core specifications structure: [SpecificationsRequirements.md](requirements/SpecificationsRequirements.md)
- Capability roots: [Capabilities.md](requirements/Capabilities.md)
- Mission requirements: [MissionRequirements.md](requirements/MissionRequirements.md)
- System requirements: [SystemRequirements/Requirements.md](requirements/SystemRequirements/Requirements.md)
- Verification specifications: [Verifications folder](requirements/Verifications)
- Relationship types: [Relation Types and Behaviors](requirements/SpecificationsRequirements.md#relation-types-and-behaviors)
- Architecture documentation: [Architecture.md](requirements/Architecture.md)


## Core Architecture

### Core Components
- **ModelManager**: Central coordinator for processing requirements
- **ElementRegistry**: Tracks and retrieves elements by identifier
- **Element**: Represents MBSE model elements (requirements, verifications)
- **Relation**: Represents connections between elements
- **Parser**: Processes Markdown to extract elements and relations
- **Formating**: Validates and fixes markdown formatting issues
- **ChangeImpact**: Analyzes how changes propagate through the model
- **MatrixGenerator**: Creates traceability matrices
- **DiagramGenerator**: Creates Mermaid diagrams from relationships
