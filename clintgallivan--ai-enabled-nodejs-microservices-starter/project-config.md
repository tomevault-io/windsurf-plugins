# Node.js Microservices Starter - Auto-Context Rules

## Context Files
Always include the comprehensive project context from cursor_context.md when starting any conversation about this project.

## Package Manager
Always use yarn, never npm. All commands should reference yarn.

## Code Style & Quality

### TypeScript Standards
- Use strict TypeScript with proper typing
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use absolute imports (configured in tsconfig.json)
- Always use async/await instead of .then() chains
- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks

### Code Formatting & Linting
- **Prettier configured**: Automatically formats code with 2-space indents, semicolons, double quotes
- **ESLint configured**: TypeScript-aware linting with security and best practice rules
- **Run before committing**: yarn quality (type-check + lint + format check)
- Use 2-space indentation
- Use semicolons at end of statements  
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use trailing commas in arrays/objects
- Keep lines under 100 characters when reasonable
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/interfaces

### ESLint Disable Pattern
- When lines get too long with inline comments, use `eslint-disable-next-line` above the target line
- ❌ `const x: any = { // eslint-disable-line ...` (Prettier breaks this)  
- ✅ `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any -- reason`
- ✅ `const x: any = {`

### File Organization
- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests, minimal business logic
- Services: Contain business logic, database operations  
- Middleware: Request processing, validation, auth
- Utils: Pure functions, helpers, validators
- One export per file for main functionality

### Error Handling
- Always use structured logging with Winston
- Include user-friendly error messages for API responses
- Log errors with relevant context (userId, email, etc.)
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 500)
- Don't expose internal errors to clients

### Security Patterns
- Never log passwords, tokens, or sensitive data
- Always hash passwords with bcrypt
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Return generic success messages for password reset to prevent enumeration

### Testing
- Write tests for all controllers and services
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, database, email service)
- Test both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Run tests with: yarn test

## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices
This is a microservices project with:
- Main API (src/) 
- Email service microservice (microservices/email-service/)
- Token cleanup microservice (microservices/token-cleanup/)

### Authentication
- JWT access tokens (15 minutes) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- Database-backed password reset and email verification tokens
- Fire-and-forget email processing via microservice
- Session-based refresh token management

### Database Patterns
- Use Prisma for all database operations
- Use transactions for multi-table operations
- Generate migrations with descriptive names
- Apply migrations per environment after deployments

### Service Integration
- Use emailQueueService for fire-and-forget emails
- Use authTokenService for database-backed tokens
- Use Redis for JWT blacklisting and Bull queues
- Make HTTP calls between services, not direct database access

## Common Fixes & Suggestions

### When suggesting code changes:
1. Fix any yarn vs npm references
2. Use proper TypeScript types
3. Follow existing error handling patterns
4. Include proper logging statements
5. Use absolute imports consistently
6. Validate inputs with existing Zod schemas

### When adding new features:
1. Follow existing controller → service → database pattern
2. Add proper error handling and logging
3. Create or update Zod schemas for validation
4. Update both CLAUDE.md and cursor_context.md
5. Consider if new environment variables are needed
6. Think about testing requirements

### Performance Considerations
- Use fire-and-forget for non-critical operations (emails)
- Implement proper database indexes
- Use Redis for caching when appropriate
- Consider pagination for large data sets
- Use connection pooling (Prisma handles this)

## Railway Deployment
- Main API: Use "GitHub Repo" option
- Microservices: Use "Empty Service" → connect GitHub → set root directory
- Set environment variables per service
- Run migrations after deployments

## Reference Files
- cursor_context.md: Complete project documentation
- CLAUDE.md: Claude Code equivalent (keep in sync)
- .env.example: Environment variable reference
- package.json: Available scripts and dependencies

## Commands to Suggest
- yarn dev: Start development server
- yarn build: Build TypeScript
- yarn test: Run Jest tests  
- yarn lint: Run ESLint with auto-fix
- yarn lint:check: Check linting without fixing
- yarn format: Auto-format with Prettier
- yarn format:check: Check formatting without fixing
- yarn type-check: TypeScript type checking
- yarn quality: Run all quality checks (type + lint + format)
- yarn prisma generate: Generate client after schema changes
- yarn migrate:dev: Apply development migrations
- docker-compose up: Start all services locally
