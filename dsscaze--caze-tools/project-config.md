## CLI Commands Naming Convention

When creating new CLI commands:
- Command names should be **short and concise** (e.g., `addprefix` instead of `adicionar-prefixo`)
- The Python **file name MUST match the command name exactly** (e.g., a command named `addprefix` must be in `addprefix.py`)
- The command function should be named the same as the file name
- Register the command in `cli.py` with `main.add_command(command_function)`
