# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MulmoCast is an AI-native multi-modal presentation platform that transforms content into videos, podcasts, PDFs, and other formats. The core workflow involves creating MulmoScript (JSON-based content descriptions) and using GraphAI to orchestrate various AI agents for content generation.

## Development Commands

### Build & Development
```bash
yarn build                    # Compile TypeScript to lib/ directory
yarn build_test              # Build and checkout lib/ files to prevent accidental commits
yarn lint                    # Run ESLint on src/ and test/
yarn format                  # Format code with Prettier
yarn ci_test                 # Run Node.js native test runner
```

### Core CLI Commands
```bash
yarn cli                     # Run the CLI directly with npx tsx
yarn test                    # Run end-to-end test (generates test files)

# Content generation shortcuts
yarn audio <script>          # Generate audio from MulmoScript
yarn images <script>         # Generate images from MulmoScript  
yarn movie <script>          # Generate complete video from MulmoScript
yarn translate <script>      # Translate MulmoScript to different languages
yarn pdf <script>            # Generate PDF from MulmoScript

# Tools and utilities
yarn scripting              # Interactive script generation
yarn prompt                 # Dump prompt templates
yarn schema                 # Output MulmoScript schema
yarn story_to_script        # Convert story to MulmoScript
```

### Publishing

This repository contains two npm packages:
- **Root** (`mulmocast`): The main CLI package
- **`types/`** (`@mulmocast/types`): Shared type definitions (symlinks to `src/types/`)

When publishing, if the diff includes changes under `src/types/`, MUST publish `types/` package as well. Both packages use the `/publish` skill.

After publishing, MUST add a new entry to the changelog:
- `CHANGELOG.md` — 2.x releases
- `CHANGELOG-1.x.md` — 1.x releases
- `CHANGELOG-0.x.md` — 0.x releases

Entry format:
```markdown
## [X.Y.Z](https://github.com/receptron/mulmocast-cli/releases/tag/X.Y.Z) (YYYY-MM-DD)

- **Feature/Fix name**: Description

📦 **npm**: [`mulmocast@X.Y.Z`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mulmocast/v/X.Y.Z)
```

Add the new entry at the top (below the header), and include it in the version bump commit.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**GraphAI-Based Processing Pipeline**: The system uses GraphAI as the orchestration engine, with custom agents for different AI services and media processing tasks.

**MulmoScript Format**: JSON-based intermediate language that describes multi-modal content with beats (content segments), speakers, media sources, and presentation styles.

**Multi-Provider AI Integration**: Supports multiple AI providers for different tasks:
- Text-to-Speech: OpenAI, Google Cloud, ElevenLabs, Gemini
- Image Generation: OpenAI DALL-E, Google Imagen
- Video Generation: Replicate models

### Directory Structure

- `src/actions/` - Main processing actions (audio, images, movie, pdf, translate, captions)
- `src/agents/` - GraphAI custom agents for AI services and media processing
- `src/cli/` - CLI interface with command builders and handlers
- `src/methods/` - Schema-specific methods (see Methods Pattern below)
- `src/tools/` - Higher-level tools for script generation and research
- `src/types/` - TypeScript schemas and type definitions (core: schema.ts)
- `src/utils/` - Utilities for file handling, FFmpeg, image processing, etc.
- `src/utils/image_plugins/` - Image type processors (markdown, textSlide, mermaid, slide, etc.)
- `src/utils/swipe_to_html.ts` - Swipe-style declarative elements → HTML + render() converter
- `src/slide/` - Self-contained slide DSL module (schema, layouts, blocks, render)
- `.claude/skills/` - Sample skills for educational content generation (see below)

### Sample Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

The following skills are included as examples of how to build MulmoScript generation workflows using Claude Code skills:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `vocab-chat` | Messenger-style vocabulary learning chat with voiceover |
| `vocab-lesson` | Multi-section vocabulary lesson (word display, examples, review with translation) |
| `conversation-chat` | Speech-bubble conversation practice with character illustration |
| `stroke-order` | Animated stroke order for hiragana, katakana, kanji, and Latin characters |

Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` with templates and helper scripts (timing calculators, generators).

### Methods Pattern (`src/methods/`)

Each Methods object contains functions that process the corresponding schema type. **When implementing data processing, first check if a relevant function exists in the Methods; if yes use it, if no add a new function to the appropriate Methods file.**

| Methods Object | Processes | Key Functions |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| `MulmoBeatMethods` | `MulmoBeat` | getPlugin, getHtmlPrompt |
| `MulmoMediaSourceMethods` | `MulmoMediaSource` | toDataUrl, getText, resolve, imageReference |
