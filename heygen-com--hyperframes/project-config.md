# HyperFrames Composition Project

## Skills — USE THESE FIRST

**Always invoke the relevant skill before writing or modifying compositions.** Skills encode framework-specific patterns (e.g., `window.__timelines` registration, `data-*` attribute semantics, shader-compatible CSS rules) that are NOT in generic web docs. Skipping them produces broken compositions.

**Doing anything with HyperFrames?** Start at `/hyperframes` — it tells you what HyperFrames can do and which skill or workflow handles your intent (make a video, TTS / BGM, prep footage, author / animate, render, install blocks), confirms your brief up front (the intent layer), and routes every "make me a…" request (a video, a deck, a composition port) to the right workflow. Read it first, especially when there's no project context to orient you. The workflows it routes to:

- `/product-launch-video` — any **website** URL or brief / script → a product launch / SaaS / promo video, or a site tour / showcase featuring the site's own captured visuals.
- `/faceless-explainer` — arbitrary text (topic / article / notes), **no URL, no website capture** → 60-90s faceless explainer.
- `/embedded-captions` — an existing talking-head video (MP4) → the same footage with captions / subtitles added (rail + embed, or pure-cinematic embed); the footage itself is untouched.
- `/talking-head-recut` — an existing talking-head / interview / podcast video (MP4) → the same footage **packaged with designed graphic overlays** (kinetic titles, lower-thirds, data callouts, pull-quotes, side panels, pip) synced to the transcript; the clip plays unchanged underneath. (Plain captions/subtitles → `/embedded-captions`.)
- `/pr-to-video` — a GitHub PR (URL / `owner/repo#N` / "this PR") → 30-90s code-change explainer (changelog / feature reveal / fix / refactor).
- `/motion-graphics` — a short (typically under 10s) design-led **motion graphic**, motion-is-the-message, no narration: kinetic type, a stat / number count-up, a chart, a logo sting, a lower-third / overlay, or an animated tweet / headline / captured-page highlight; rendered to MP4 or a transparent overlay. Longer / narrated / custom → `/general-video`.
- `/music-to-video` — a **music track** (audio file, or video to pull audio from) → beat-synced video (lyric / slideshow / kinetic promo). Music drives pacing; user-supplied images / videos are cut onto the same beat grid.
- `/slideshow` — a **presentation / pitch deck / interactive deck** — discrete slides, fragment reveals, branching, hotspot navigation, presenter mode. Output is a navigable deck, not a rendered video.
- `/general-video` — fallback for any other video (title card, longer brand / sizzle reel, multi-scene montage, static loop, custom composition) and the home of **companion mode** — co-create with the full HyperFrames toolbox; the original hyperframes authoring flow, any length.

**Porting an existing composition?** `/remotion-to-hyperframes` translates a Remotion (React) composition into HyperFrames HTML — a source migration, separate from the creation workflows above.

The domain skills (`/hyperframes-core`, `/hyperframes-animation`, `/hyperframes-keyframes`, `/hyperframes-creative`, `/hyperframes-cli`, `/media-use`, `/hyperframes-registry`, `/figma`) and the full capability map live inside `/hyperframes` — it is the single source of truth for which skill handles which intent.

> **Tailwind v4 projects** (`hyperframes init --tailwind`): see `/hyperframes-core` → `references/tailwind.md`.

> **Skill missing or stale?** Run `npx hyperframes skills update <name>` to install/refresh
> the specific skill you need (the `/hyperframes` router does this automatically before
> entering a workflow), or bare `npx hyperframes skills update` to refresh the core set plus
> everything already installed — neither pulls the full set. Restart the agent session so
> newly installed skills load.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # start the preview server (long-running — keep it alive in background)
npm run check        # lint + runtime + layout + motion + contrast (one command)
npm run render       # render to MP4
npm run publish      # publish and get a shareable link
npx hyperframes lint --verbose  # include info-level findings
npx hyperframes lint --json     # machine-readable output for CI
npx hyperframes docs <topic> # reference docs in terminal
```

> **`npm run dev` is a long-running server, not a one-shot command.** It blocks until stopped.
> In Claude Code, always run it with `run_in_background: true`. Never run it as a foreground
> command — it will time out and the server will die, breaking the browser preview.

> **Pinned CLI version.** These scripts pin an exact `hyperframes@X.Y.Z` so this project re-renders identically over time. Weeks later that pin lags fixes shipped since. To move up: `npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project . --check` (shows the delta), then `npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project .` to rewrite the pins. Always unpinned — the pinned script re-runs the old version against itself.
