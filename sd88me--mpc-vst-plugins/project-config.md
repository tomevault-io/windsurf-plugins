# mpc-vst-plugins: agent guide

Native VST2 plugins for Akai MPC OS standalone devices (MPC Live/One/X/Key, Force), loaded by MPC's
built-in JUCE plugin host, with native MPC screen skins. Start here:

1. `docs/NOTES.md`: everything verified on hardware so far, plus open issues. Treat it as the source of
   truth, and add to it whenever you verify something new (with the date).
2. `docs/PORTING.md`: the checklist for porting an engine or app to a plugin.
3. `docs/BENCH.md` (CPU check) and `docs/RELEASING.md` (release zip + installer) before shipping a port.
   `docs/ROADMAP.md`: repo features still to do.
4. `.claude/skills/mpc-vst-plugin/SKILL.md`: the build → skin → register → test workflow and gotchas.

Ground rules:
- Offline first: x86 host test (`tools/test_port.sh <vst.json>`, ASan) and an offline skin preview before anything goes
  to a device.
- The device is shared with the user's live setup. Ask before restarting MPC, back up `MPC.settings` before
  editing it (with MPC stopped), and stage files as `x.new` then `mv`.
- Never commit Akai's stock skin JSON or PNGs, or the Steinberg SDK. Describe formats instead; the VST2 ABI here is
  hand-written.
- Keep the repo device-generic: no private IPs, serials or MockbaMod-specific naming. MockbaMod facts go in
  NOTES.md only where they affect behaviour.
- Commit trailers per the session's instructions; one commit per concern.
