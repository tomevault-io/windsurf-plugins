## 🐹 Go-Specific Rules

### Code Style
- Follow `gofmt` formatting strictly
- Use `golint` and `go vet` for static analysis
- Organize imports: standard library → third-party → local
- Use meaningful package names (lowercase, no underscores)
- Keep package names short and descriptive

### Error Handling
- Always check and handle errors explicitly
- Use the idiomatic `if err != nil` pattern
- Create custom error types when appropriate
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf` or `errors.Wrap`
- Don't panic in library code, return errors instead

### Concurrency
- Use goroutines for concurrent operations
- Prefer channels for communication between goroutines
- Use `context.Context` for cancellation and timeouts
- Avoid shared mutable state, use channels or mutexes
- Follow the principle: "Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating"

### Performance
- Use proper data structures: slices vs arrays, maps vs slices
- Pre-allocate slices when size is known: `make([]Type, 0, capacity)`
- Use string builder for concatenating multiple strings
- Profile performance-critical code with `go test -bench`
- Avoid premature optimization

### Testing
- Write table-driven tests when appropriate
- Use `t.Helper()` in test helper functions
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use `go test -race` to detect race conditions
- Benchmark performance-critical functions

### Documentation
- Use `godoc` format for public functions and types
- Start comments with the name being documented
- Provide examples in documentation when helpful
- Keep comments concise and focused on "why" not "what"
