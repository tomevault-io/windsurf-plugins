# CLAUDE.md — Working instructions for this repo

HilbertRaum is an **open-source, offline, local-LLM workspace** that runs from a
portable drive. No cloud, no telemetry, all user data local.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: this repo is PUBLIC — never push directly to `master`
The repository is public on GitHub (`HilbertraumAI/HilbertRaum`, since 2026-07-12). Every
change, however small, goes through a **feature branch + pull request with green CI**
(`ci-success` is a required check). Do NOT commit on `master` and do NOT push to `master`
directly, even when your credentials can bypass the branch protection: a direct push skips
CI and review and publishes the change to the world immediately. Docs-only changes follow
the same rule.

## Read these first, in order
1. [`BUILD_STATE.md`](BUILD_STATE.md) — the live handoff/state file. **Always read first.** It says what is done, current decisions, and the next actions. It holds dated entries for the currently-open waves ONLY (hard size budget, enforced by `repo-hygiene.test.ts`): retired entries live verbatim in [`docs/build-log.md`](docs/build-log.md) (grep it when an old "BUILD_STATE <date> entry" citation needs resolving), and the shared data contracts live in [`docs/data-contracts.md`](docs/data-contracts.md).
2. [`docs/product-vision.md`](docs/product-vision.md) — the durable product intent (thesis, target user, commercial model, positioning guardrails, scope boundaries, roadmap). It condenses the retired original spec `CLAUDE_HilbertRaum_MVP.md` (deleted 2026-07-11; full text in git history). The `spec §N` anchors cited across code and docs resolve via the **§-anchor legend** at the end of [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) ("Original MVP spec — retirement record").
3. Topic docs under [`docs/`](docs/) (architecture, drive layout, packaging, model policy, …) as the task requires.

## Doc lifecycle rule
Implementation **plan** documents are working papers: once a plan is fully implemented, condense
it into a short **design record** (decisions + the facts they rest on + the design as built)
**folded into the relevant topic doc as a §-numbered section**, and delete the plan file — the
full original stays in git history. Don't let finished plans linger; they drift and contradict
the code. Keep the record's §-anchors stable: code comments cite them. Templates:
`docs/rag-design.md` §12 (Phase-21 record) and `docs/architecture.md` "GPU acceleration —
design record" (§1–§8). A standalone plan file should only exist for work that is still open
(none are currently open). Even a just-closed wave whose plan is heavily cited
as a unit can be retired: fold its decisions + research into the topic doc and add a
**§-anchor legend** that keeps the historical `§N` citations resolvable without churning the
comments — see `docs/architecture.md` "Functionality wave 3 — design record" (its §-anchor
legend), and the Skills / Image-understanding records.

## Hard rules (from spec §0)
- **No cloud dependencies. No telemetry. No analytics. No remote crash reporting.**
- Do not call hosted AI APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Mistral/etc.).
- Never commit model weights, user data, embeddings, logs, or generated files.
- Keep the app fully usable with **no internet connection**.
- Keep all user data local by default; no plaintext workspace unless explicitly chosen.
- No hardcoded developer-specific absolute paths; don't assume the drive path is identical across OSes.
- Treat Windows as first-class; keep macOS/Linux supported in the architecture.
- Keep service boundaries clean (spec §9.2 interfaces) so runtimes can be swapped.

## Stack (see BUILD_STATE §3 for rationale)
- Electron + React + TypeScript + Vite (`electron-vite`), npm workspaces.
- `node:sqlite` (built-in) for storage. Mock runtime + mock embedder for dev/test; real `llama.cpp` runtime + embeddings integrated (Phase 10).

## Per-phase ritual (MANDATORY — spec-driven)
At the end of every phase:
1. Tests green (`npm test`). 2. App still builds/launches. 3. **Update affected `docs/`.**
4. **Update `BUILD_STATE.md`** (status, decisions, next actions, risks — short entries per its retention rule; shared-shape changes go to `docs/data-contracts.md`). 5. Commit referencing the phase.

A phase is not done until docs + `BUILD_STATE.md` are updated.

## Commands
```bash
npm ci             # install (dev-time only; needs internet once). Lockfile-exact — never rewrites
                   # package-lock.json (issue #49); `npm install` only for deliberate dep changes.
npm run dev        # launch the app
npm run build      # production build
npm test           # unit + integration tests
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript checking
npm run package    # portable build via electron-builder (manual, network-touching — R2)
npm run package:win # Windows portable .exe specifically
```
