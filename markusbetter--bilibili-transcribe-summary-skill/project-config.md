# Bilibili Transcribe Summary

Use this skill when the user gives a Bilibili link and wants to know what the video says or wants a summary.

## Trigger rules

Trigger this skill when both conditions are true:

- The user provides a Bilibili video link, a `BV...` id, or a `b23.tv` short link.
- The user intent is to analyze, summarize, transcribe, extract subtitles, or understand the video content.

## What this skill does

1. Check whether `node` is available and is version 18 or newer.
2. If the user wants ASR, check whether `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY` exists.
3. Run the pipeline script in `scripts/bilibili_pipeline.mjs`.
4. Prefer official subtitles when available.
5. If subtitles are unavailable, use the anonymous audio URL from the page playinfo.
6. Download the audio as `.m4s`, then rename it to `.mp3` without transcoding.
7. If an API key is present, send the renamed `.mp3` to SiliconFlow `TeleAI/TeleSpeechASR`.
8. Read the transcript and answer the user's request.

## First-run readiness marker

After the first successful `probe` or `run`, the script writes `.skill-ready.json` into the output directory.

If that marker already exists from a prior successful run, you can skip repeating setup reminders and go straight to the workflow. Only fall back to dependency or API-key guidance if the script actually fails.

## Quick commands

Probe only:

```bash
node scripts/bilibili_pipeline.mjs probe "https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1R6PzzAE9k" --output-dir ./output
```

Run the full workflow:

```bash
node scripts/bilibili_pipeline.mjs run "https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1R6PzzAE9k" --output-dir ./output
```

Run with an explicit key:

```bash
node scripts/bilibili_pipeline.mjs run "https://b23.tv/lsocHNd" --output-dir ./output --api-key "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Environment checks

Before the first successful run:

- Verify `node --version` works.
- If the user expects transcription, verify `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY` is set, or pass `--api-key` explicitly.
- If the environment blocks network access, request permission before running the script.

If `.skill-ready.json` already exists, do not repeat these setup checks unless the script fails.

If Node is missing, guide the user to install Node.js 18+ and then retry. Read `references/setup.md` for install commands.

If the API key is missing, tell the user to create one here and then retry:

- https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/me/account/ak

You can then suggest one of these commands:

```bash
set SILICONFLOW_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

```powershell
$env:SILICONFLOW_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

## Output files

The script writes these files into the chosen output directory:

- `probe_result.json`: parsed page info, subtitle info, and candidate media URLs
- `audio.mp3`: the downloaded anonymous audio stream after renaming `.m4s` to `.mp3`
- `transcription_result.json`: SiliconFlow raw JSON result when ASR runs
- `transcript.txt`: plain transcript text from subtitles or ASR
- `.skill-ready.json`: indicates that the workflow has already run successfully at least once in this output directory

## Response rules

After a transcript is available:

- If the user asked for a full transcript, return or save the transcript text.
- If the user asked for a focused summary, summarize only the requested parts.
- If the user gave no summary preference, default to a concise key-point summary.
- Mention whether the transcript came from official subtitles or ASR.
- If subtitles and ASR are both unavailable, explain the blocker and stop.

## Portability

For Codex, OpenClaw, and Claude Code notes, read `references/tool-compatibility.md` when you need to adapt this folder to another agent environment.

## Notes

- This skill has been verified on both full Bilibili links and `b23.tv` short links.
- For the validated workflow in this project, renaming the downloaded `.m4s` audio file to `.mp3` was sufficient for SiliconFlow transcription, with no transcoding step.
- Anonymous access is opportunistic. Some videos may still fail due to Bilibili restrictions or missing page playinfo.
