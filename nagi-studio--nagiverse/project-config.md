# Review Instructions

This repository is a content-first knowledge graph. When reviewing pull requests, optimize for content quality and safety before style.

## Review priorities

1. Verify factual integrity.
If a claim looks unsupported, contradictory, overconfident, or likely AI-fabricated, do not approve it. Ask for a correction or a source.

2. Reject unsafe content.
Flag any sign of spam, fake marketing, affiliate bait, political campaigning, malicious instructions, phishing, credential theft, malware, or other harmful behavior.

3. Enforce contributor requirements.
If a PR adds notes under `content/users/<id>/`, make sure that user has `content/users/<id>/profile.yaml`. If it is missing, ask the contributor to create it first.

4. Check note quality.
If a note is thin, placeholder-like, or lacks obvious sourcing for factual claims, remind the contributor to improve it before merge.

5. Approve clean knowledge-sharing PRs.
If the PR is purely knowledge sharing, factually sound, policy-safe, and the repository contribution requirements are met, approve it.

## Review style

- Keep reviews concise and concrete.
- Reference the exact file paths that need changes.
- Prefer actionable requests over generic comments.
