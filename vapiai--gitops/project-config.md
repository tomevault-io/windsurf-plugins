# Updating the Learnings Knowledge Base

The `docs/learnings/` folder is a **persistent, structured knowledge base** — not a loose document dump. It is designed so that AI agents can search it efficiently (like a RAG system) and find the right answer to a customer's problem quickly.

## Design Principles

1. **Problem-first organization.** Every section should be framed as a problem a customer might encounter, followed by what causes it and how to fix it. Use the pattern: symptom → root cause → solution.
2. **One topic per file.** Each `.md` file covers a single domain (tools, assistants, voicemail detection, etc.). Don't mix unrelated topics in one file.
3. **Searchable headings.** Use descriptive headings that match how someone would describe the problem: "`beepDetectionEnabled` is carrier-level, not LLM-level" is better than "Beep Detection".
4. **Cross-link related files.** Use relative markdown links like `[voicemail-detection.md](voicemail-detection.md)` to connect related topics.
5. **No redundancy.** If information belongs in an existing file, add it there. Only create a new file when the topic is genuinely distinct and would make the existing file too broad.

## When Adding New Content

### Adding to an existing file

1. Read the target file first to understand its structure and style.
2. Find the most logical section for the new content.
3. Match the existing format — most files use the "What you might expect / What actually happens / Recommendation" pattern or a "Problem / Cause / Fix" pattern.
4. If the content cross-references another topic, add a link.

### Creating a new file

1. Choose a descriptive, kebab-case filename: `voicemail-detection.md`, `outbound-agents.md`.
2. Start with a one-line description of what the file covers.
3. Use `---` horizontal rules between major sections.
4. Structure content as searchable problem/solution pairs, not as a narrative.
5. **Update all three index locations:**
   - `docs/learnings/README.md` — add to the Quick Routing table AND the Full Index (in the correct category: Configuration Reference, Troubleshooting Runbooks, or Recipes & Guides)
   - `AGENTS.md` — add to the "Learnings & recipes" routing table near the top of the file AND to the project structure tree
   - `CLAUDE.md` — if it exists and has a learnings routing section, add the entry there too

### Refactoring existing content

When source material spans multiple existing files (e.g., a runbook that touches tools, assistants, and squads):

1. **Create a dedicated file** for the primary topic (e.g., `voicemail-detection.md`).
2. **Upsert relevant facts** into existing files (e.g., add voicemail tool docs to `tools.md`, outbound assistant modes to `assistants.md`).
3. **Cross-link** from the existing files to the new dedicated file for deeper reading.

## Content Style

- Use tables for comparisons, settings, and decision matrices.
- Use code blocks with `yaml` for configuration examples.
- Use **bold** for key terms and `code` for field names, values, and tool names.
- Avoid narrative prose — prefer structured, scannable content.
- Include "Common Failures" or "Testing Matrix" tables when the topic involves debugging.

## Source Material

When integrating raw source documents (Notion exports, runbooks, PDFs):

1. **Never copy-paste verbatim.** Synthesize into the learnings format.
2. **Extract the non-obvious parts.** Skip things that are already in the API docs or AGENTS.md.
3. **Validate against existing content.** Check for contradictions with what's already in the learnings folder.
4. **Attribute if needed.** If the source contains experimental or unverified information, note it.
