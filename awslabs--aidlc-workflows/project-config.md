# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle) is a methodology for guiding AI coding
agents through structured software development workflows. This repository contains
the core workflow rules, detailed phase-specific rules, and an evaluator framework.

The distributable product is the `aidlc-rules/` directory, which is zipped and
published via GitHub Releases.

## Key documentation

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contribution process and conventions
- [docs/ADMINISTRATIVE_GUIDE.md](docs/ADMINISTRATIVE_GUIDE.md) — CI/CD architecture,
  protected environments, secrets, permissions, and release process
- [docs/DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md) — running CodeBuild locally,
  security scanner details and remediation instructions
- [docs/WORKING-WITH-AIDLC.md](docs/WORKING-WITH-AIDLC.md) — user guide for the
  AI-DLC methodology (context management, prompt patterns, phase walkthroughs)
- [docs/GENERATED_DOCS_REFERENCE.md](docs/GENERATED_DOCS_REFERENCE.md) — complete
  reference for the `aidlc-docs/` directory structure generated during workflows
- [docs/writing-inputs/](docs/writing-inputs/) — guides and examples for vision and
  technical environment documents

**Which docs to read by task type:**

- CI/CD, workflows, or releases → `ADMINISTRATIVE_GUIDE.md`, `DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md`
- aidlc-rules content → `WORKING-WITH-AIDLC.md`, `GENERATED_DOCS_REFERENCE.md`
- Vision or technical environment documents → `docs/writing-inputs/`

## Setup commands

```bash
# Lint all markdown files
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"

# Fix markdown lint issues automatically
npx markdownlint-cli2 --fix "**/*.md"

# Run evaluator tests (from scripts/aidlc-evaluator/)
cd scripts/aidlc-evaluator && uv run pytest
```

## Code style

- All content is Markdown — follow the `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml` configuration
- MD013 (line length) is disabled — long URLs, tables, and code examples are acceptable
- MD033 (inline HTML) is disabled — `<img>` tags are used for screenshots
- MD024 (duplicate headings) is disabled — section names repeat across platform guides
- MD036 (emphasis as heading) is disabled — bold text used as sub-labels in lists
- MD060 (table alignment) is enforced — table pipes must be vertically aligned
- MD040 (fenced code language) is enforced — always specify a language on code fences
- Commit messages follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)

## Testing instructions

- Test rule changes with at least one supported platform (Amazon Q Developer, Kiro,
  Cursor, Cline, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot) before submitting
- If adding or updating installation instructions, test on macOS, Windows CMD, and
  Windows PowerShell
- Run `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` before committing to catch lint issues
- The pre-commit hook runs markdownlint automatically if configured

## PR instructions

- PR titles must follow conventional commits format (e.g., `fix: description`)
- Always include this contributor statement at the end of the PR body:

  > By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy,
  > and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of the
  > [project license](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/blob/main/LICENSE).

- CI enforces: conventional commit title, contributor statement, markdownlint, and
  a do-not-merge label check
- Use the structure from `.github/pull_request_template.md`

## Security scanners

Six scanners run on every push to `main`, every PR, and daily. All HIGH and CRITICAL
findings must be remediated or have documented risk acceptance before merge.
