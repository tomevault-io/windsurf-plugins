This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Horace Mann PTSA Calendar Generator - A one-page PDF calendar generator for the 2025-26 school year that combines Lake Washington School District (LWSD) dates with PTSA-specific events. Built with Python, Jinja2 templates, and WeasyPrint to generate a compact, print-ready Letter-size calendar.

## Key Features

- **Single-page PDF** optimized for Letter-size printing
- **3x4 month grid** layout (September through June + July/August)
- **Visual event marking system**:
  - Black background: No school days
  - Grey background (#ccc): Half days
  - Bold text: Early release Wednesdays (auto-marked starting Sept 10, 2025)
  - Square boxes: First/Last days (Sept 2, Sept 5, June 17)
  - Red circles (#C40A0C): PTSA events
  - Grey text: Weekend days
- **Two-column Important Dates** section with date range consolidation
- **PTSA branding**: Red header bar with "Horace Mann PTSA | 2025-26 Calendar"
- **Automatic deployment** to GitHub Pages for easy sharing

## Development Commands

### Setup Environment
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment (REQUIRED)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build Calendar
```bash
# Always activate venv first!
source .venv/bin/activate

# Generate PDF for 2025-26 school year
python build.py --year 2025 --data data/all_events.csv --out build/HoraceMann-PTSA-2025-26-Calendar.pdf

# Open the generated PDF (macOS)
open build/HoraceMann-PTSA-2025-26-Calendar.pdf
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **build.py**: Main generator script with key enhancements:
   - Date range consolidation for Important Dates (e.g., "12/22-1/2" for Winter Break)
   - Automatic early release Wednesday marking (starting Sept 10, 2025)
   - Special diamond/circle marking for specific dates
   - PTSA event differentiation with "PTSA:" prefix
   - Removal of leading zeros from dates for cleaner display

2. **Data Files**:
   - `data/all_events.csv`: Single CSV file containing all 57 events (district + PTSA combined)
   - Events are distinguished by type field (ptsa_event for PTSA events)

3. **Visual Styling** (`styles/calendar.css`):
   - Red theme (#C40A0C) for PTSA branding
   - Optimized spacing for single-page fit (8pt margins, 14pt cell height)
   - District events in Important Dates: grey text (#555) on light grey background
   - PTSA events in Important Dates: red text (#C40A0C)

### Data Schema

CSV format for event file:
```csv
date,start_date,end_date,type,label,notes
2025-09-02,,,first_day,First Day (Grades 1-12),
,2025-12-22,2026-01-02,no_school,Winter Break,
2025-10-10,,,ptsa_event,Picture Day,
```

### Key Functions in build.py

- `bucket_by_month()`: Collects events and auto-marks early release Wednesdays
- `make_month_cells()`: Creates calendar grid cells with diamond/circle marking
- `format_important_dates()`: Consolidates date ranges, sorts and prefixes PTSA events
- `format_date_short()`: Formats dates as M/D without leading zeros
- `Cell` dataclass: Represents day cells with `show_asterisk` property for complex display logic

### Template Enhancements

- Red header bar with PTSA branding
- Square/circle visual indicators in calendar cells
- Two-column Important Dates with background differentiation
- Updated Key section with all event type explanations

## System Dependencies

WeasyPrint requires system-level libraries:
- macOS: `brew install pygobject3 cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-pip libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info`

## CI/CD & Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow
`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` automatically:
1. Builds PDF on push to main
2. Deploys to GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch)
3. Creates web viewer with embedded PDF

### Access Published Calendar
- Direct PDF: `https://allisonwhilden.github.io/PTSA-onepager-calendar-generator/calendar.pdf`
- Web viewer: `https://allisonwhilden.github.io/PTSA-onepager-calendar-generator/`

Note: Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (Settings → Pages → Source: gh-pages)

## Testing & Debugging

```bash
# Test the build
source .venv/bin/activate
python build.py --year 2025 --data data/all_events.csv --out build/test.pdf

# Open in browser for visual inspection
open build/test.pdf
```

## Project-Specific Notes

- **Virtual environment is REQUIRED** - WeasyPrint won't work without it
- Calendar covers September 2025 through August 2026
- Preschool events have been removed from district data
- Early release Wednesdays are automatically marked starting Sept 10, 2025
- Date ranges in Important Dates are consolidated to save space
- PTSA events are visually distinct with red coloring throughout
