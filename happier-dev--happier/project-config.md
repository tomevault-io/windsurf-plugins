# Context window anxiety management (CWAM)

- Avoid pasting large logs; summarize and reference artifacts by path.
- If approaching limits, follow the project's compaction/recovery guidance.

# Share snippets not whole files in prompts

## Body
Share snippets, not entire files:
- Provide the minimal relevant function/component/section with small surrounding context.
- Combine multiple small snippets when cross-references are required instead of dumping a full file.

# Context7 Required For Post-Training Packages

## Body
If work touches any configured post-training package:
- Refresh up-to-date docs via Context7 BEFORE implementation decisions.
- Use `edison config show context7 --format yaml` as the source of truth for what is “post-training”.

Reference: `guidelines/shared/CONTEXT7.md`
