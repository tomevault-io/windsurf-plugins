# Edison Framework Rules

## Critical Principles (Config-Driven)

These rules are **project-configurable** via Edison YAML. Do not assume every project uses the same enforcement level.

- **TDD**: write failing test FIRST (RED), then implement (GREEN), then refactor.

- **No internal mocks**: test real behavior; only mock at true system boundaries.

- **Configuration-first**: avoid hardcoded behavior; load config from YAML/environment.

- **Quality basics**: DRY, SOLID, KISS; avoid speculative/YAGNI code.
- **Root cause**: fix underlying issues; avoid “dirty fixes”.

## Development Practices

- When updating code, ALL related tests should be updated (unit, integration, e2e)
- When a test fails, analyze and fix the ROOT CAUSE - never simplify/skip tests
- Before implementing, search for existing patterns to reuse/extend
- Maintain strict coherence and unity across the codebase

## Testing Guidelines

- Prefer real behavior tests over mocked behavior.
- Use temporary directories for filesystem tests (auto-cleaned).
- Use isolated databases for integration tests (template DBs, containers, or per-test schemas).
- Use real HTTP clients against local test servers for API tests.
- Only mock at system boundaries (third-party services you do not control).
