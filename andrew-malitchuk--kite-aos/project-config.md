# Project Architecture: kite-aos

## Overview

Kite is a highly modular Android application designed for dedicated hardware usage (kiosk mode). It
features a modern tech stack based on Jetpack Compose, Orbit MVI, Koin DI, and Clean Architecture
principles.

## Architectural Layers

The project is organized into four primary layers, ensuring strict separation of concerns and high
testability.

### 1. Infrastructure (`build-logic`)

Contains the Gradle convention plugins that standardize build settings, dependency management, and
Kotlin/Android configurations across the repository.

- **Manifest**: [build-logic/GEMINI.md](build-logic/GEMINI.md)

### 2. Common & Core (`common-core`, `data-core`, `domain-core`)

Provides the foundational abstractions used by all other modules, including error handling monads,
asynchronous execution helpers, and base resource markers.

### 3. Data Layer (`data-*`)

Handles all external data sources including persistence (Room), networking (MQTT), platform APIs,
and user preferences (Proto DataStore).

- Follows the API/Impl pattern to decouple contracts from specific technologies.
- Orchestrates multiple sources through concrete Repository implementations.

### 4. Domain Layer (`domain-*`)

Contains the core business logic of the application. It is pure Kotlin and independent of any
platform or UI framework.

- **Repository API**: Defines the contracts for data access.
- **Use Cases**: Implements single, atomic business operations.

### 5. Presentation Layer (`presentation-*`)

The UI and platform integration layer built with Jetpack Compose and Orbit MVI.

- **Core modules**: Handle cross-cutting concerns like Styling, Localization, Navigation, and
  low-level Platform services (Motion detection).
- **Feature modules**: Independent screens (Main, Settings, Onboarding) that encapsulate their own
  UI logic and ViewModels.

---

## Technical Stack

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with a custom Squircle-based design system.
- **Architecture**: MVI (Orbit framework) within a Clean Architecture structure.
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin (using KSP annotations).
- **Persistence**: Room (Database) and Proto DataStore (Preferences).
- **Communication**: MQTT for device telemetry and Home Assistant discovery.
- **Hardware Integration**: CameraX for intelligent motion detection.

## Building and Running

* **Build Project:** `./gradlew build`
* **Assemble Debug:** `./gradlew assembleDebug`
* **Module Docs**: Most modules contain their own `GEMINI.md` for deep-dive technical documentation.
