- Fixed foreign key constraint errors in `backend/seed.py`.
- Modified `backend/seed.py` to correctly order table deletion, preventing foreign key violations when clearing the database.
- Updated `backend/seed.py` to dynamically assign user, category, and tag IDs to feedback and coaching records, avoiding hardcoded values that caused foreign key errors.
- **Attempted Login Fix 1:** Refactored the backend code to resolve circular dependencies. This did not resolve the login issue.
- **Attempted Login Fix 2:** Corrected the backend API URL in the frontend from `http://backend:8000` to `http://localhost:8000` to resolve a DNS error.
- **Attempted Login Fix 3:** Configured backend CORS policy to explicitly allow the frontend's origin (`http://localhost:5173`). This did not resolve the login issue, which manifested as a CORS error only on successful login attempts.
- **Investigation:** Identified that the frontend was sending login credentials with an incorrect `Content-Type` (`multipart/form-data`) instead of the `application/x-w-form-urlencoded` expected by the backend's OAuth2 implementation. This is the likely cause of the persistent CORS error.
- **Attempted Login Fix 4:** Corrected the frontend to send login credentials with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `Content-Type`. This did not resolve the CORS error.
- **Attempted Login Fix 5:** Simplified the frontend login request by removing the `Content-Type` header to allow the browser to set it automatically. This did not resolve the CORS error.
- **Attempted Login Fix 6:** Manually added the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the login response with the incorrect port (`5173`). This did not resolve the CORS error.
- **Correction:** The user identified that the frontend is running on port `7070`, not `5173`. This was a critical oversight.
- **Attempted Login Fix 7:** Corrected the port in the CORS middleware to `7070`. This did not resolve the CORS error.
- **Attempted Login Fix 8:** Replaced `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` with a Pydantic model, which introduced a `405 Method Not Allowed` error. This was a step backward.
- **Login Fix Success:** Corrected the frontend to send login credentials with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and explicitly set the `Content-Type` header. Login is now successful.
- **Login Fix Success:** Corrected the frontend to send login credentials with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and explicitly set the `Content-Type` header. Login is now successful.
- **Logout Functionality:** Added a `logout` function to `frontend/src/services/api.js` and integrated it into `frontend/src/components/Header.jsx` to clear the authentication token and redirect to the login page.
- **UI/UX Refactor:** Initiated and completed a comprehensive UI/UX refactor to align with `front-end-des.json` and `front-end-req.md`, including micro animations. This involved:
    - Updating `frontend/tailwind.config.js` with custom design tokens.
    - Adjusting global styles in `frontend/src/index.css` and `frontend/src/App.css`.
    - Refactoring `frontend/src/components/Header.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Breadcrumbs.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/FeedbackLog.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/SubmitFeedback.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/AgentProfile.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/CoachingTracker.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Reports.jsx`, and `frontend/src/components/Modal.jsx` to match the new design and incorporate animations.
- **Fixed UI Import Path (Attempt 1 - Incorrect):** Attempted to correct the import path for `front-end-des.json` in `frontend/src/pages/Reports.jsx` from `../../front-end-des.json` to `../../../front-end-des.json`. This did not resolve the error.
- **Fixed UI Import Path (Attempt 2 - Incorrect):** Attempted to correct the import path for `front-end-des.json` in `frontend/src/pages/Reports.jsx` to `../../../../front-end-des.json`. This also did not resolve the error.
- **Fixed UI Import Path (Attempt 3 - Incorrect):** Integrated the design system colors directly into `frontend/tailwind.config.js` to make them available as Tailwind utility classes. Subsequently, removed the direct import of `front-end-des.json` from `frontend/src/pages/Reports.jsx` and replaced color references with their corresponding hex values. This caused new errors related to Tailwind class generation.
- **UI/UX Refactor (Revised Plan):** Restructuring `frontend/tailwind.config.js` to correctly map design system values to Tailwind's `extend` properties. This involves updating `index.css` and all previously modified components to use the new Tailwind classes.
- **UI Import Path Fix (Ongoing):** The previous attempts to fix the UI import path in `frontend/src/pages/Reports.jsx` were unsuccessful and introduced new errors. The issue is still unresolved.
