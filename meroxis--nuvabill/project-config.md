# Nuvabill project rules

Nuvabill is a billing, automation and support platform for hosting companies (a from-scratch WHMCS alternative)
by RapidNet Ltd, licensed AGPL-3.0 with an attribution term (see NOTICE).

## Architecture

- Staff (`App\Models\Admin`, guard `admin`, `routes/admin.php` under `/admin`) and clients (`App\Models\Client`, guard `web`) are separate models and guards. Never let one sign in as the other.
- Staff permissions are listed in `Role::PERMISSIONS`. Protect admin routes with the `admin.can:{permission}` middleware.
- Billing lives in `app/Billing`: `OrderPlacer`, `InvoiceManager`, `PaymentRecorder`, `InvoicePaidHandler`, `RenewalGenerator`. Record every payment through `PaymentRecorder` with the gateway's reference so duplicates are ignored and services, invoices and emails stay in step.
- Control panel actions go through `App\Provisioning\Provisioner`. Never call server modules directly from controllers.
- The nightly run is `App\Automation\DailyAutomation` (`php artisan nuvabill:cron`).
- Read settings with the `setting('key')` helper (`App\Support\Settings`: JSON values, cached, secrets encrypted). Add every new key with its default to `Settings::DEFAULTS`.

## Security and demo mode

- `App\Http\Middleware\SecurityHeaders` sets the CSP and other headers on every response. Load scripts, styles and fonts from this site only (built by Vite), never from a CDN.
- Proxies are trusted through `NUVABILL_TRUSTED_PROXIES` (`config/trustedproxy.php`). Only the forwarded IP and protocol headers are read.
- The public demo runs with `NUVABILL_DEMO=true` (`App\Support\Demo`). Add every new route that changes settings, sign-ins or calls another server to `Demo::LOCKED_ROUTES`.

## Money

- Store money as integer minor units (cents) with a currency code. Never use floats.
- Format with the `money()` helper and convert input with `App\Support\Money`.

## Extensions and themes

- Payment gateways and server modules are extensions in `extensions/{gateways|servers}/{slug}` with an `extension.json` manifest. Built-in ones use the same mechanism as marketplace ones.
- Gateways extend `App\Extensions\Gateways\Gateway`. Server modules extend `App\Extensions\Servers\Module`.
- Client-area views render through the `theme::` namespace from `themes/{active}/views`, falling back to `themes/nova`. Admin views live in `resources/views/admin`.
- Shared UI classes are in `resources/css/components.css`. Colors are CSS variables in `resources/css/tokens.css` with light and dark values.

## Email

- Email templates are rows in `email_templates` with `{{ dotted.placeholders }}` replaced by `TemplateMailer::render()`. Never compile templates with Blade.

## Updates and releases

- The version is in `config/nuvabill.php`. Releases are signed zips built by `php artisan nuvabill:package`, and the updater verifies the Ed25519 signature before installing. Never commit the signing secret key.
- Migrations must work on MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite and must be safe to run during an automatic update.

## Branding

- Keep the "Powered by Nuvabill" credit (`App\Support\Branding`) in the client area, invoice PDFs and emails. It is a license requirement.

## Tests

- Feature tests use factories and the `DefaultDataSeeder`. Real HTTP calls are blocked with `Http::preventStrayRequests()`, so fake gateway and cPanel APIs with `Http::fake()`.

## Writing

- Write user-facing text in plain, short English. Many users read English as a second language.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.4. You are an expert with the Laravel ecosystem. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.
