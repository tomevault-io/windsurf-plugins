# Langflow Flow Development Rules

## Flow Creation Standards

### Requirements Analysis
- Fully understand user requirements before creating flows
- Define input/output specifications clearly
- Identify all dependencies and integrations needed
- Plan component connections and data flow

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variable names and field identifiers
- Use PascalCase for component names and class definitions
- Ensure all names are descriptive and self-explanatory
- Use consistent naming across the entire flow

### Flow Structure Guidelines
- Design flows to be modular and reusable
- Minimize complexity while maximizing functionality
- Create logical, organized flow structures
- Ensure smooth data transitions between components
- Follow single responsibility principle for each flow section

### Documentation Requirements
- Add concise comments explaining flow purpose
- Document expected inputs and outputs
- Include error handling descriptions
- Ensure all fields and comments are in English
- Provide usage examples where helpful

### Component Integration
- Integrate components seamlessly with proper data types
- Maintain data consistency across all flow steps
- Use appropriate connection types (Data, Message, DataFrame)
- Validate data transformations between components
- Handle edge cases in component connections

### Error Handling in Flows
- Implement robust error handling at flow level
- Use conditional routers for error paths
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Include fallback mechanisms where possible
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### Performance Optimization
- Design flows for efficiency and resource optimization
- Avoid unnecessary data transformations
- Use parallel processing where applicable
- Minimize memory usage in large data flows
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Testing and Validation
- Test complete flows end-to-end
- Validate all component connections
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Ensure flows meet functional requirements
- Verify performance under expected load

### Production Readiness
- Ensure flows are deployment-ready
- Optimize for production environments
- Include proper monitoring and logging
- Implement security best practices
- Document deployment requirements

## Flow JSON Structure

### Standard Flow Template
```json
{
  "id": "unique-flow-id",
  "data": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "component-id",
        "type": "CustomComponent",
        "position": {"x": 100, "y": 100},
        "data": {
          "node": {
            "template": {
              "input_field": {
                "value": "default_value"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": "edge-id",
        "source": "source-node-id",
        "target": "target-node-id",
        "sourceHandle": "output_name",
        "targetHandle": "input_name"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Component Connection Rules
- Always specify correct sourceHandle and targetHandle
- Ensure data type compatibility between connected components
- Use descriptive IDs for nodes and edges
- Position components logically in the flow layout
- Group related components visually

### Flow Validation Checklist
- [ ] All required inputs have default values or connections
- [ ] Error handling paths are implemented
- [ ] Component types match expected functionality
- [ ] Data flows follow logical sequence
- [ ] No circular dependencies exist
- [ ] All outputs are properly utilized or connected

## Common Flow Patterns

### Data Processing Pattern
1. Input → Validation → Processing → Output
2. Include error handling at each step
3. Log processing steps for debugging
4. Return structured results

### API Integration Pattern
1. Authentication → Request → Response Handling → Output
2. Implement retry logic for failed requests
3. Handle rate limiting appropriately
4. Parse and validate API responses

### File Processing Pattern
1. File Input → Validation → Processing → Results → Export
2. Support multiple file formats
3. Handle large files efficiently
4. Provide progress feedback

### Conditional Routing Pattern
1. Input → Condition Check → Route A/B → Process → Merge Results
2. Use routers for decision points
3. Handle all possible paths
4. Provide default routing options
