# CLAUDE.md — AI Master Notes Repository

Instructions for Claude Code when working in this repo. This is AI-editing guidance, not human onboarding — see `docs/style-guide.md` for the human-readable equivalent.

## Repository layout

```
AI_Master/
├── templates/
│   ├── summary_template.tex   ← source of truth for summary.tex files
│   └── exams_template.tex     ← source of truth for exams.tex files
└── courses/
    └── <course-slug>/
        ├── summary.tex
        ├── exams.tex
        └── figures/
```

Course folders use lowercase kebab-case slugs (`reinforcement-learning`, `computer-vision`).

**What gets committed:** `.gitignore` whitelists course folders — only
`README.md`, `summary.{tex,pdf}`, `exams.{tex,pdf}`, `exams_solutions.{tex,pdf}`,
and `figures/` are tracked (plus the Deep RL `cheatsheet.{tex,pdf}` exception).
Everything else stays local: lecture slides (`slides/`), raw exam scans,
exercise notebooks, quiz/real-exam dumps, `.claude/`, build artifacts. To
publish a new document type, add an explicit `!` rule to the courses block
in `.gitignore`.

## summary.tex conventions

- **Structure:** `\chapter` per major topic, `\section` / `\subsection` within.
- **Accent color:** `#1B3A5C` (deep navy) — never change this.
- **Philosophy:** running prose is the default; boxes are landmarks, not
  the primary content carrier. When in doubt, write prose.

### Box types (summary.tex)

| Box | Color | Use for |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `\begin{defbox}[title={…}]` | Blue (#1A5276) | Formal definitions |
| `\begin{thmbox}[title={…}]` | Red (#922B21) | Key theorems, important formulas |
| `\begin{exbox}[title={…}]` | Green (#1E8449) | Worked examples |
| `\begin{intbox}` | Amber (#9A6A00) | Intuition, mental models |
| `\begin{notebox}[title={…}]` | Purple (#5B2C6F) | Exam traps, caveats |

Do NOT add boxes without a clear reason. Every unnecessary box dilutes
the signalling value of all boxes.

---

## exams.tex conventions

- **Structure:** `\section` per thematic topic (no chapters — article class).
  Sections should map to the chapter breakdown of the corresponding `summary.tex`.
- **Questions are NOT numbered manually** — `\questiontitle` auto-increments
  a counter.
- **Exact duplicates are removed.** When the same question appeared on
  multiple exams, keep one instance and add `\repeatnote` at the top.
- **Question wording is paraphrased, never copied verbatim.** Reword every
  question stem so it is not a literal copy of the original exam, while
  preserving the exact meaning and difficulty. Example: *"Which statement
  about molecular graphs and molecular fingerprints is correct?"* →
  *"Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship
  between molecular graphs and molecular fingerprints?"* This is rephrasing
  for legal safety, not a content change.
- **Answer choices, numbers, and math are kept as-is.** Do not alter answer
  options, numeric values, or mathematical expressions when paraphrasing the
  stem; only fix wording where a scan was messy. The same applies to
  `exams_solutions.tex`, which shares the questions.

### Box types (exams.tex)

| Macro / Box | Color | Use for |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `\questiontitle{Title}` … `\closequestion` | Blue (#1A5276) | Every exam question |
| `\begin{keybox}[title={…}]` | Green (#1E8449) | Key insight or answer hint |
| `\begin{notebox}[title={…}]` | Amber (#9A6A00) | Organizational notes only |

### Structural macros

| Macro | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `\questiontitle{Short title}` | Opens a numbered blue question box |
| `\closequestion` | Closes the question box |
| `\repeatnote` | Prints italic "Asked multiple times." |
| `\choice` | `☐` bullet item for multiple-choice |
| `\answerline{3cm}` | Fill-in underline of specified width |
| `\workingspace{4cm}` | Dashed-border blank box for student work |

### Question types

| Question type | Format inside `\questiontitle` … `\closequestion` |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Multiple choice** | `\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.8em]` with `\choice` items |
| **Single number / short expression** | `\answerline{3cm}` inline at the end of the question text |
| **Calculation / short derivation** | `\workingspace{4cm}` on its own line after the question |
| **Open / long answer** | `\workingspace{7cm}` on its own line after the question |

The heights for `\workingspace` are guidelines — adjust to fit the expected length of the answer.

### Answer key

Every `exams.tex` file ends with an answer key:

```latex
\newpage
\section*{Answer Key}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Q\arabic*.}, leftmargin=3em, itemsep=4pt]
  \item \textbf{B}
  \item $x = 0.5$
  \item [key steps: …]
\end{enumerate}
```

- The list is numbered manually and must match the auto-incremented question counter order.
- Keep answers concise: letter for MCQ, expression for fill-in, key steps/formula for derivations, bullet points for open questions.
- **Never** put answer content inside `\questiontitle` / `\closequestion` blocks — the question boxes must stay blank.

### exams_solutions.tex (worked solutions, optional)
