description: Keep Vercel Hobby free-tier bandwidth safe — never proxy file bytes through Functions
---


# Bandwidth policy (Vercel Hobby)

Hobby includes **10 GB Fast Origin Transfer** (CDN ↔ Functions) and **100 GB Fast Data Transfer** (CDN ↔ visitors). Exhausting origin transfer pauses the project.

## Hard rules

1. **Never proxy file bytes through a Vercel Function.** PDFs, images, notebooks, and code files are fetched by the browser directly from Google Drive (`drive.usercontent.google.com`) via [`src/lib/driveFileCache.ts`](src/lib/driveFileCache.ts). Do not recreate `/api/resources/preview` or `/api/resources/code`.
2. **API routes return JSON/text only**, typically under ~100 KB. No `alt: "media"`, `responseType: "stream"`, `Readable.toWeb`, or `application/pdf` responses.
3. **No hover/background prefetch of large files.** Client fetches to `/api/*` and Drive downloads must be user-initiated (open, submit, explicit action). No polling loops for live updates unless the payload is tiny and cached.
4. **Do not add `src/middleware.ts` / `src/proxy.ts`** unless strictly necessary with a narrow matcher — Middleware can double Fast Origin Transfer for Function requests.
5. **PWA precache must not include files over ~200 KB.** Keep `pdf.worker.min.mjs` and large logos out of `publicExcludes` / Workbox precache; fetch them on demand.
6. **Heavy binary always comes from Google or another third-party origin with CORS**, never through Vercel. Cache hits live in the browser Cache API (`utility-pdf-v2`), not on Vercel.

## When adding features

- Prefer ISR / `revalidate` on HTML pages so HTML is served from the CDN, not a Function.
- Prefer `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=…` on small public JSON APIs.
- If a CI test in `src/lib/__guards__/noFileProxy.test.ts` fails, fix the architecture — do not weaken the guard.
