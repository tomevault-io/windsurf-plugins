# AGENTS.md — AI Tools

This repository is the canonical source for reusable AI-agent skills, supporting resources, and
installation tooling. Claude Code and Codex are first-class targets. Keep reusable workflows
compatible with the open Agent Skills format so other clients can adopt them with thin discovery
adapters.

## Repository layout

- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — canonical portable skills. New reusable workflows belong here.
- `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` — required Codex UI metadata; it must not contain workflow logic.
- `skills/<name>/references/<provider>-*.md` — provider capability adapters, read only when that
  runtime is selected.
- `commands/compounding-templates/` — versioned compatibility assets for repositories installed
  before lifecycle workflows became portable. New workflow logic belongs in skills.
- `scripts/install-skills` — installs the shared skills through symlinks and refreshes compatibility
  links without overwriting real files.

**The installed skills are symlinks into THIS WORKING TREE, not a copied snapshot.** Every consuming
repository therefore reads whatever is currently checked out here: an edit is live the moment it is
saved, before any commit, and **leaving this repository on a feature branch silently changes the skills
every other repository runs.** Two consequences worth holding onto:

- **Return to `main` before you finish.** A wrap that merges a skill PR but leaves the checkout on the
  now-deleted branch leaves consumers reading a branch. Verify with `git -C <install-source> rev-parse
  --abbrev-ref HEAD` — the install source is wherever `~/.claude/skills/<name>` resolves to, which may be
  a symlinked path (e.g. `~/.ai-tools` → this repo) rather than an obvious one.
- **This is also why validation here is cheap and worth running.** There is no build or publish step to
  catch a broken skill; the next session in an unrelated repository is the integration test.

## Cross-agent skill rules

- Use lowercase hyphenated skill directory names and include only `name` and `description` in
  portable `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- Describe triggers clearly in `description`; keep the body imperative, concise, and tool-neutral.
- Refer to capabilities rather than product tool names. For example, say "ask one focused question"
  instead of requiring a specific question tool.
- Put provider-specific behavior in a clearly named reference or platform adapter. Do not duplicate
  the portable workflow.
- Portability does not mean lowest-common-denominator behavior. Keep the invariant method in
  `SKILL.md`, then use native provider features through explicit adapters for scheduling, execution
  isolation, connectors, permissions, models, notifications, and UI actions.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed playbooks to one-level-deep `references/`, repeatable
  deterministic work to `scripts/`, and copyable templates to `assets/`.
- Do not reintroduce top-level `commands/*.md` wrappers. Native lifecycle-skill discovery was
  verified in Claude Code and Codex before those wrappers were retired; only the versioned
  `commands/compounding-templates/` compatibility subtree remains.

## Portable repository lifecycle

The canonical lifecycle is a cooperating skill set, not a provider-specific command suite:

- `compounding` installs, upgrades, or inspects the repository system.
- `compounding-drain` works up to three ready improvements safely, one at a time.
- `compounding-curate` keeps standing context lean and correctly routed.
- `crosscheck` runs the cross-model double-check loop: one model family files evidence-shaped
  notes (no self-assessment, runnable verification, do-not-relitigate) for the other to verify
  with validated-then-applied findings.
- `prd-reconcile` keeps confirmed product direction aligned with reality.
- `maintain-technical-design` keeps the implementation map current.
- `catch-up` establishes read-only session context.
- `capture-learning` routes discoveries to durable sources.
- `end-session-review` closes documentation, validation, queue, and review loops.
- `repository-hygiene` owns recurring maintenance, with separate automation-runtime adapters.
- `sync-ai-tools` installs and verifies the same canonical skills for every supported agent.

New repository setups must expose these behaviors through `AGENTS.md` and the shared skill layer.
`CLAUDE.md`, Codex configuration, and other provider files may import or point to the shared layer,
but must not become independently maintained copies. Claude Workflows, Codex scheduled tasks, and
other native features remain first-class adapters around portable skills.

## Continuous improvement

- Treat a confirmed product or architecture decision as a documentation event. When a repository has
  a PRD, technical design, or governing decision record, update the affected source in the same change;
  do not wait for implementation to make the decision durable.
- Fix obvious low-risk gaps inline. Route larger, uncertain, or recurring work to the compounding queue
  with evidence and acceptance criteria, and never leave a substantive follow-up only in chat prose.
- Prefer durable repository homes over memory-only notes. When a non-obvious multi-step procedure recurs,
