# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants working with this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Claude Code plugin for [Infrahub](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub), the infrastructure data management platform by OpsMill. The plugin provides skills covering the full Infrahub development lifecycle: schema design, data population, validation checks, generators, transforms, menu customization, and live data analysis.

The repository is a pure Markdown-based skills project (no Python code). Each skill is defined in its own directory under `skills/` with rules, examples, and reference documentation. Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) format.
