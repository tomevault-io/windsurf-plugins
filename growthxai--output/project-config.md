# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Output.ai (often referred as just Output) framework codebase.

## Project Overview

Output.ai is an AI framework for building reliable production-ready LLM workflows & agents. It contains multiple NPM packages and supporting infrastructure with best AI engineering practices baked-in. Under the hood, the Output framework uses Temporal.io as the execution layer.

## Documentation References

- **Project setup & commands**: See [README.md](README.md)
- **Workflow structure & examples**: See [README.md#workflow-structure](README.md#workflow-structure)
- **Framework packages**:
  - Core: [sdk/core/README.md](sdk/core/README.md)
  - LLM: [sdk/llm/README.md](sdk/llm/README.md)
  - HTTP: [sdk/http/README.md](sdk/http/README.md)
  - Credentials: [sdk/credentials/README.md](sdk/credentials/README.md)
  - Evals: [sdk/evals/README.md](sdk/evals/README.md)
  - Framework: [sdk/framework/README.md](sdk/framework/README.md)
  - CLI: [sdk/cli/README.md](sdk/cli/README.md)
- **Test examples**: See [test_workflows/](test_workflows/) directory

## Tech Stack Context

- Runtime: Node.js 24.3 with ES modules
- Workflow orchestration: Temporal
- LLM providers: Anthropic, OpenAI (via AI SDK)
- Testing: Vitest
- Containerization: Docker Compose

## Environment Variables

Configuration is documented in:

- Root environment: [README.md#env-file](README.md#env-file)
- Workflow secrets: Required in `test_workflows/.env`

## Package Management

This monorepo uses **pnpm workspaces** with a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

### Docker Builds

The API Dockerfile uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --filter output-api` to install only API dependencies from the root lockfile.

## Available Sub Agent Experts

Use these specialized agents when working across technical domains:

| Agent | Domain | When to use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `temporal-expert` | Workflow orchestration | Workflow/activity boundaries, retry policies, determinism, worker performance |
| `llm-expert` | LLM integration | output-llm module usage, prompt templates (LiquidJS), streaming, cost optimization |
| `api-expert` | API server | Express middleware, workflow execution endpoints, discovery (see api/README.md) |
| `nodejs-expert` | Node.js/TypeScript | ES modules, TypeScript config, monorepo package structure, build tooling |
| `testing-expert` | Testing | Vitest workflows, mocking output-llm, integration tests, prompt template tests |
| `docker-expert` | Containerization | Docker Compose dev setup, multi-stage builds, Temporal service networking |

## When Working on This Project

1. Check existing documentation before implementing new features
2. Follow patterns in `test_workflows/` for new workflows
3. Maintain TypeScript definitions alongside JavaScript implementations
4. Use ES module syntax throughout
5. All external operations should be wrapped inside Temporal activities (steps)
6. Call the related sub agents and use the provided experts when needed. If you're not sure which sub agent to use, ask for help, or ask Claude which sub agent would be the most helpful.
7. Always ask the user if they would like to update the documentation after any new changes.
8. Always base your code on to existing code patterns and project hierarchical organization;
9. Write production code: Optimized, Explicit and Succinct (NOT verbose);
10. Don't over use comments;
11. Follow best code practices: DRY, KISS, YAGNI; When they make sense.
12. Prefer a functional approach over an object-oriented approach; Avoid using classes/inheritance unless absolutely necessary.
13. DO NOT opt out of linting rules or change the linting rules unless specifically requested by the user.
14. Use snake_case for all file names and folder names.

## Writing .prompt Files: ProviderOptions Guide

When creating `.prompt` files, understanding the `providerOptions` structure is critical.

### Decision Tree: Where Does This Option Go?

```
Is it a standard AI SDK option (temperature, maxTokens, topP, etc.)?
├─ YES → Top-level config (alongside provider and model)
└─ NO → providerOptions

In providerOptions:
├─ Is it 'thinking' or 'order'? → Top-level (special AI SDK features)
└─ Is it provider-specific? → Nested under provider namespace
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Mistake 1: Putting provider options at top-level**
```yaml
provider: anthropic
effort: medium          # WRONG: 'effort' is not a standard option
```

✅ **Correct:**
```yaml
provider: anthropic
providerOptions:
  anthropic:
    effort: medium
```

---

❌ **Mistake 2: Nesting `thinking` under provider**
```yaml
providerOptions:
  anthropic:
    thinking:           # WRONG: thinking is top-level
      type: enabled
```

✅ **Correct:**
```yaml
providerOptions:
  thinking:             # Correct: top-level special key
    type: enabled
```

---

❌ **Mistake 3: Wrong namespace for Vertex Gemini**
```yaml
provider: vertex
model: gemini-2.0-flash
providerOptions:
  vertex:               # WRONG: Gemini uses 'google' namespace
    useSearchGrounding: true
```

✅ **Correct:**
```yaml
provider: vertex
model: gemini-2.0-flash
providerOptions:
