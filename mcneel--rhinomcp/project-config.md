[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) is Google's open-source terminal AI assistant. It speaks MCP, so once you point it at the Rhino MCP server it can drive Rhino & Grasshopper the same way Claude or Codex can.

If you're choosing between assistants and aren't sure, start with [Claude Desktop](../connector); it's the gentler entry point.

## 1. Install Gemini CLI

[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) — install and sign in. See the [Gemini CLI install guide](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli#installation) if you need it.

## 2. Install the Rhino plugin

{{< yak package="Rhino-MCP-Platform" version="8" >}}
{{< yak package="Rhino-MCP-Platform" version="9" >}}

If that doesn't work you can try the below:

1. Open Rhino 8 (and/or Rhino 9 WIP)
2. Run the `PackageManager` command
3. Search for, and install Rhino-MCP-Platform

## 3. Wire up the Rhino MCP server

1. In Rhino, run the `MCPConnect` command. It prints the command Gemini CLI needs to launch the Rhino MCP router.
2. Open `~/.gemini/settings.json` (create it if it doesn't exist).
3. Add an `mcpServers` entry for the Rhino server, pasting the command and args from step 1:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "rhino": {
         "command": "rhino-mcp-router",
         "args": ["--default-version", "8"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Restart Gemini CLI. The `rhino` server should appear when you list MCP servers from inside a session.

> **Pick the Rhino version** by changing the `--default-version` arg.
> Use `8` for Rhino 8, `9` for Rhino 9 WIP/BETA.
