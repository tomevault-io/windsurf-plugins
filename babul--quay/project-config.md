# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

Quay is a native macOS SSH connection manager (macOS 15+, Apple Silicon) built on top of `libghostty` — the core of the Ghostty terminal — without shipping Ghostty's full UI. Think Tabby-style connection manager UX on a Ghostty-speed terminal engine.

## Build commands

**First-time setup** (requires Xcode 16+, `zig` 0.16.x, `xcodegen`):
```sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
open Quay.xcodeproj
```

**Regenerate Xcode project** (after changing `project.yml`):
```sh
xcodegen generate
```

**Run tests:**
```sh
xcodebuild -project Quay.xcodeproj -scheme Quay -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

**Run a single test suite** (e.g., SSHCommandBuilderTests):
```sh
xcodebuild -project Quay.xcodeproj -scheme Quay -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' test -only-testing:QuayTests/SSHCommandBuilderTests
```

**Rebuild libghostty** (only needed when bumping the ghostty submodule):
```sh
./scripts/build-ghostty.sh
```

The Xcode project is gitignored and generated from `project.yml` by XcodeGen. Never edit `.xcodeproj` files directly.

## Architecture

### Concurrency model
Swift 6 strict concurrency is enforced (`SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY=complete`). All UI code and libghostty callbacks run on `@MainActor`. C callbacks from libghostty are `nonisolated static` functions that use `MainActor.assumeIsolated` (they are always invoked on the main thread by libghostty). Async/await is used in `TerminalTabItem.run()` for PTY event polling.

### State management — two layers
- **Top-level app state** uses Composable Architecture (TCA): `AppFeature` reducer + `TerminalClient` DependencyKey. TCA is the boundary between sidebar/tab actions and the terminal subsystem.
- **Low-latency paths** (tab state, surface render state) use `@Observable` singletons (`TerminalTabManager`, `GhosttySurfaceBridge`) directly, bypassing TCA to avoid view update overhead.

### libghostty integration (`Quay/Terminal/`)
`GhosttyRuntime` is a per-process singleton wrapping `ghostty_app_t`. It owns a weak-ref registry of `GhosttySurfaceBridge` instances (one per tab) to avoid retain cycles. `GhosttySurfaceView` is an `NSView` subclass implementing `NSTextInputClient` for IME; it is wrapped by `GhosttyTerminalView` for SwiftUI via `NSViewRepresentable`. See `docs/ghostty-integration.md` for the build/pin/bump process.

**Quay intentionally inherits the user's own Ghostty config.** `loadUserConfig()` loads `Quay/Resources/default-ghostty.conf` first, then `ghostty_config_load_default_files()` — so anything in `~/.config/ghostty/config` or `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config` overrides the bundled defaults. A bundled setting appearing to have no effect is usually this, not a bug; check the user's Ghostty config before investigating. See "Config inheritance" in `docs/ghostty-integration.md`.

### Secret handling — zero plaintext (`Quay/Secrets/`)
Credentials are never stored as plaintext — only as reference URIs (`keychain://service/account`). `AskpassServer` is a Unix domain socket server at `$TMPDIR/quay-askpass-<uuid>.sock` (mode 0600) that resolves URIs at connection time and pipes the secret to the bundled `QuayAskpass` CLI (the SSH_ASKPASS helper). The socket is unlinked after one use. The only place Quay writes to Keychain is the login-script step lock action — writes are deferred until profile save. See `docs/secrets-architecture.md` for the full threat model.

### Connection data flow
```
ConnectionProfile (SwiftData)
  → TerminalTabManager.openOrSelectTab()
  → SessionBootstrap → GhosttySurfaceConfig + optional AskpassServer
  → GhosttyRuntime.spawn(SSHCommand) → libghostty fork+exec /usr/bin/ssh
       ↘ (password/passphrase auth) SSH_ASKPASS → QuayAskpass → AskpassServer → KeychainStore
```

### Persistence (`Quay/Persistence/`)
SwiftData `ModelContainer` stored at `~/Library/Application Support/<bundleID>/Quay.store`. CloudKit sync is intentionally disabled for v0.1. Settings export/import uses AES-GCM-256 encryption with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation (`SettingsBundle.swift`). SSH credentials and key passphrases are exported only as their reference URIs. Locked login-script step values are resolved to plaintext inside the bundle so it's portable to a new machine; the bundle password is what protects them.
