## Pull Request Format

### Title

Use the same format as commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

Use imperative mood: "add" not "added", "update" not "updates"

### Description Structure

**What Changed**

- List concrete changes made to files, configurations, or features
- Be specific about components modified

**Why**

- Explain the motivation or problem being solved
- Reference issues if applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`)

**Breaking Changes** (if applicable)

- Clearly mark breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefix
- Explain migration path or required actions

**Testing**

- Include test commands or manual testing procedures

**Deployment Notes** (if applicable)

- Document any required configuration changes
- Note dependencies or prerequisites

## Best Practices

- Keep messages technical and factual
- Include file paths or component names when relevant
- Avoid vague terms like "various updates" or "improvements"
- Reference related issues or PRs when applicable
- For infrastructure changes, document the impact on running services
