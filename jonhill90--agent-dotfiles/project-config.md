# AGENTS.md

## Project

`agent-dotfiles` is Jon's versioned personal harness for AI coding agents —
dotfiles for agents. Portable Agent Skills remain individually installable;
canonical instructions, hooks, agents, settings, and MCP declarations are the
other managed layers. Product requirements live in `docs/PRD.md`; the
technical design in `docs/SPEC.md`.

This file is the shared repository policy. `CLAUDE.md` and
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` point here for harness compatibility.

## Product Boundaries

- Keep `skills/` portable and independently installable.
- Keep canonical content out of harness-owned directories.
- Treat `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, and `.github/` as adapters,
  configuration, or repository automation.
- Do not make installation of one skill inherit the complete personal workflow.
- Keep project-specific and employer-specific material out of this repository.

## Canonical Layout

```text
apm.yml                  # APM package manifest (deploys the repo at user scope)
.apm/                    # APM source tree — symlinks into the canonical dirs
skills/
  <skill-name>/
    SKILL.md
    scripts/
    references/
    assets/
instructions/
  global.instructions.md # canonical global agent instructions (≤200 lines)
  overlays/              # per-harness additions, wrapper-projected
agents/
hooks/                   # canonical hook scripts, harness-agnostic
settings/                # wrapper-owned config fragments (claude, pi, mcp)
evals/                   # behavioral-parity scenarios + committed results
docs/
scripts/
tests/
```

Projection is installer-owned (`apm install -g` + `scripts/sync.py apply`).
The former committed symlink matrix (`.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, …)
is retired; validation errors if any reappear.

## Skill Authoring

- Use `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Match the directory name and frontmatter `name`.
- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens; maximum 64 characters.
- Include what the skill does and when it should trigger in `description`.
- Keep portable frontmatter to `name` and `description` by default.
- Use imperative instructions.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines.
- Move detailed material to `references/` and link it directly from `SKILL.md`.
- Put deterministic, repeated operations in tested scripts.
- Do not add a README inside a skill directory.
- Avoid harness-specific preprocessing syntax in portable skills.

Harness-specific extensions require an explicit compatibility note and must not
replace the portable workflow.

## Agent Authoring

- Store reusable agent definitions in `agents/<name>.md`.
- Use kebab-case filenames.
- Keep harness-specific projections or schemas in adapter directories.
- Validate tool lists as YAML arrays where the target format requires arrays.

## Workflow

1. Orient in the repository and inspect current changes.
2. Define observable success criteria.
3. For behavioral code, use red-green-refactor.
4. Make the smallest coherent change.
5. Run repository validation and relevant script tests.
6. Review the diff for generated files, broken links, and source duplication.

## Required Verification

Run before considering repository changes complete:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_repository.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
npx skills add . --list
```

Run language-specific tests when changing bundled scripts or tools.

## Distribution

- Use `npx skills` for individual skill discovery and installation.
- Use APM as the sync backbone: the repo is an APM package installed at
  user scope (`apm install -g`), with a thin wrapper for what APM does
  not own (SPEC §7).
- Do not hand-maintain a growing matrix of harness skill copies.
- Generated package or harness output must identify its canonical source.

## Guardrails

Do:

- use current primary documentation for changing formats and tools;
- install skills selectively;
- preserve progressive disclosure;
- keep generic improvements upstream here;
- document compatibility assumptions.

Do not:

- copy employer-owned content into this repository;
- add duplicate skill identities;
- encode one harness as the portable source model;
- load every skill into every workflow by default;
- claim validation without running the commands above.
