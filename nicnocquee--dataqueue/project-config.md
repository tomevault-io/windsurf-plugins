When generating migration files, use the command `date +%s000` to get the timestamp for the prefix of the migration file.

There must be tow parts in the sql file: the up migration and the down migration.

The up migration should be after the comment `-- Up Migration` and the down migration should be after the comment `-- Down Migration`.
