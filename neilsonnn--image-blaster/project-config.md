# Claude Code Skills

Follow the official Claude Code skills docs when editing `SKILL.md` files: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills

- Skills are thin task surfaces: frontmatter plus concise instructions. Do not turn them into long orchestration manuals.
- `context: fork` means the skill runs in a forked subagent. The rendered `SKILL.md` is the subagent prompt and does not have access to parent conversation history.
- `agent` selects which subagent type executes the forked skill. If omitted, Claude Code uses `general-purpose`.
- `allowed-tools` pre-approves listed tools for the active skill. It does not restrict all other tools; permissions still apply.
- `description` and `when_to_use` should front-load trigger phrases. Keep them clearer than the body.
- Use `disable-model-invocation: true` for side-effecting skills that only the user should trigger.
- Invoked skill content persists for the rest of the session, so keep standing guidance short and unambiguous.
- Keep project rules high-level: shared conventions, routing, and ordering. Put skill-specific operational details in the relevant `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- Skills and project rules should teach agents which files matter for a workflow. Do not move that workflow knowledge into `.mjs` scripts unless the script owns a provider contract or a truly generic filesystem invariant.
- Project `.mjs` tools should be dumb, explicit, and argument-driven: compute paths, download a given URL to a given path, delete a given path, or apply generic no-clobber/path-safety checks. Avoid encoding asset-specific knowledge like "world panoramas are important" when the Skill can read JSON and pass explicit args.
- Prefer agent intelligence plus clear Skill instructions over hidden orchestration in scripts. If a script starts deciding which workflow artifacts are important, pause and move that decision back into the Skill/rule layer.
