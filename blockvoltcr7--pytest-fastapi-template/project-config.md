# Testing Rules for GenAI Project

This document outlines testing requirements for new feature implementations.

## Core Testing Requirements

- All new features must have corresponding tests.
- Tests must be written using pytest and include Allure reporting features.
- API tests must be placed in the `tests/` directory with filename `test_*.py`.
- Tests should include appropriate annotations for Allure reporting.

## Allure Reporting Structure

- Each test module should use `@allure.epic()` to define the high-level area.
- Test classes should use `@allure.feature()` to define the feature being tested.
- Test methods should use `@allure.story()` to define the specific test scenario.
- Use `@allure.severity()` to indicate test importance.
- All tests should include descriptive steps using Allure's step annotations.

## Example Structure

```python
import allure
import pytest

@allure.epic("Core Functionality")
@allure.feature("Feature Name")
class TestFeatureName:
    
    @allure.story("Basic Functionality")
    @allure.severity(allure.severity_level.CRITICAL)
    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Test description here"""
        with allure.step("First step description"):
            # Code for first step
            pass
            
        with allure.step("Verification step"):
            # Assertion code
            assert True
```

## API Testing Requirements

- Use the session fixture for API requests.
- Include appropriate response attachments.
- Test both happy path and error conditions.
- Include clear test descriptions.

## Test Categories

Use pytest markers to categorize tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.api  # For API tests
@pytest.mark.integration  # For integration tests
@pytest.mark.slow  # For slow-running tests
```

## Running Tests

- Always run tests with Allure reporting enabled:
  ```
  pytest --alluredir=allure-results
  ```
- Generate the report with:
  ```
  allure serve allure-results
  ```

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When implementing new features, AI assistants should:

1. Identify testable components in the new feature.
2. Create corresponding test files with proper Allure annotations.
3. Ensure tests cover both expected behavior and edge cases.
4. Implement appropriate fixtures for test setup and teardown.
5. Include detailed steps using `allure.step()`.
6. Add test data attachments using `allure.attach()`.
7. Document any test requirements in test docstrings.
