# Ace Of Spades Packet System

## Packet Architecture
The game uses a packet-based networking system where each packet type represents a specific game action or state.

## Packet Implementation
Each packet in [test_packets.py](mdc:test_packets.py) follows a similar pattern:
1. Create packet instance
2. Set packet properties
3. Serialize to binary (write)
4. Deserialize from binary (read)
5. Verify properties match

## Key Packet Types
- **Game State**: InitialInfo, SetHP, MapEnded, etc.
- **Player Actions**: ShootPacket, BlockBuild, ChangeTeam, etc.
- **World Objects**: PlaceMG, PlaceMedPack, PlaceC4, etc.
- **UI/Feedback**: ChatMessage, ShowTextMessage, PlaySound, etc.

## Testing Process
The test_packets.py file contains both the packet definitions and the test functions to verify their correctness.

The packet verification works by:
1. Creating a packet with known test values
2. Writing the packet to a ByteWriter (serialization)
3. Reading the packet from a ByteReader (deserialization)
4. Dumping the packet properties to verify integrity

## Python Version Handling
- Python 2 is used to test against the original implementation in the aosdump directory
- Python 3 is used to test against the new implementation in the project root
- The script automatically adjusts import paths based on Python version
