# Morning Star Repository Maintenance Rule (Cursor)

This rule applies when maintaining the Morning Star harness repository in Cursor.

## Source of Truth

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical maintenance policy.
- Runtime behavior remains in `mstar-*` skills.
- Avoid duplicating long maintenance prose across runtime skill files.

## What This Rule Adds (Cursor-specific)

- Keep Cursor host guidance aligned with OpenCode host guidance.
- Use `.cursor/skills/mstar-routing-eval/` only for routing/prompt/rule regression work, not normal feature implementation.
- If routing/gate semantics changed, include routing-eval updates and evidence.

## Required Maintenance Behavior

- Read before edit, and keep edits surgical.
- Keep skill descriptions trigger-accurate.
- Use skill-creator guidance for new skills or major rewrites.
- Sync bilingual docs when onboarding or install behavior changes.
- Any change to installation/usage wording in `README.md` MUST be mirrored in `README_CN.md` in the same change set (and vice versa).
- Never modify secrets or user-owned credential files.

## Quick Validation

- Before publishing the Cursor plugin: `.cursor/LOCAL-VALIDATION.md`.
- Lint/typecheck as relevant to edited files.
- Confirm docs and install snippets remain runnable.
- If either README changed, verify both `README.md` and `README_CN.md` were reviewed and updated for parity.
- Summarize host-specific divergence explicitly if introduced.
