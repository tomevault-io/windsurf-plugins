## Unit Test Guideline

Unit tests should be verified using the red-green principle, which means:

1. Temporarily break production code in order to let unit test fail
2. Run unit test and check unit test failed with expected error message
3. Recover the production code

In step 2, if unit test still passed or failed with unrelated error message, 
it means the unit test implementation was wrong and didn't test the production code as expected.

## API Design Guidelines

The HTTP API follows specific design principles:

- **RPC Naming Style**: Endpoints use action-based names (e.g., `/readFile`, `/writeMediaMetadata`)
- **Response Format**: Every response contains both `data` and `error` fields:
  - `data`: Contains the response payload on success
  - `error`: Contains error message on failure (format: "Error Reason: detail message")
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Used only for HTTP layer status, NOT business logic:
  - `200`: HTTP request succeeded (business logic success/error determined by `error` field)
  - `400`: Invalid request or validation error
  - `404`: HTTP endpoint not implemented (NOT resource not found)
  - `500`: Server error
  - Resource not found returns 200 with `error: "Error Reason: detail message"`

## Path Handling

Always use the `Path` class from `core/path.ts` for path operations:
- Handles both Windows and POSIX paths
- Platform-agnostic path construction
- Validates paths are within allowed directories
- Works in both Node.js and browser environments

## Type Safety

- All API responses use Zod for validation
- Request/response types are defined in `core/types.ts`
- Media metadata structure is comprehensive with TMDB integration
