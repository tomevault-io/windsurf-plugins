## Build

```bash
cd build && cmake --build . --config Release     # incremental
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release              # reconfigure after CMakeLists changes
```

Outputs: `build/VarispeedDelay_artefacts/Release/{Standalone,AU,VST3}/`
Run: `open build/VarispeedDelay_artefacts/Release/Standalone/VarispeedDelay.app`
Install AU + auval: `./install-au.sh`
Tests: `cd build && ctest --output-on-failure` (engine unit tests + preset/parameter tests)

## Architecture

JUCE 8 plugin (VST3/AU/Standalone), C++20, JUCE submodule in `libs/JUCE`.
Delay where each repetition is replayed at a different tape speed.

See `plan.md` for the full design: period/ping-pong buffer model, raw vs stable feedback,
crossfade rules, parameter table, phases. `USAGE.md` documents the accepted behaviours.

```
src/DelayEngine.{h,cpp}    generation ring, voice pool, periods, fades, bend, sync, clip
src/Voice.h                per-voice state
src/GraphicEQ.{h,cpp}      7 x stereo RBJ peaking biquad, POD coefficients
src/Presets.{h,cpp}        embedded + user presets, reset-then-overlay apply
src/LookAndFeel.{h,cpp}    tapedeck palette, knobs, switches, fonts
src/PluginProcessor.*      APVTS layout, raw pointers, playhead, programs
src/PluginEditor.*         fixed 800x500 content the editor scales, hover help footer
tests/EngineTests.cpp      DelayEngine only, no AudioProcessor dependency
tests/PresetTests.cpp      preset staleness + parameter round trips
```

Engine invariants worth knowing before changing it:

- Generation buffers are never memset. Each has one writing voice whose `w` advances in
  lockstep with the period counter `n`, so the input `+=` lands on a slot just written and
  `=` otherwise. Readers are bounded by `written`.
- The period ends at the *current* effective T, not the length latched at the boundary —
  that is what makes a 20 s to 200 ms shrink react in 200 ms. TAPE spacing is the one
  exception, where the latched voice duration is the period.
- The shortest period is the host's buffer size, not `kMinDelayMs` — that constant is only
  the `time_ms` parameter floor. The UI shows the real period when the clamp binds.
- A generation records input for one period but its writing voice recycles past that at
  any rate below 1, so the buffer has a join at index `periodLen` that no voice envelope
  covers. `Gen::inputTaper` crossfades the recorded input into the recycled-only tail
  there. It is zero at rate 1 and above, which keeps unity sample-exact.
- The unity bypass needs more than `rEff == 1`. It assumes the repetition tiles the grid,
  which is false once a source buffer is longer than a period (left over from a slower
  setting) — `Voice::contiguous` gates it. And the policy either side of a join must
  agree: a voice inherits `fadeIn` from its predecessor's `fadeOut`, otherwise a fading
  voice hands over to a bypassing one and the seam is a cliff.
- Fades are positional (computed from the voice's state each sample), never latched
  countdowns, so a rate change mid-fade un-fades correctly.
- Raw's recycle write ends with the audible tap; Stable's is a unity copy exactly as long
  as its source, so it outlives the audible tap at speeds above 1.

## UI

`STYLE.md` is the visual system - canvas, palette, type scale, knob and chip anatomy,
interaction rules. Read it before changing anything that is drawn. The design sheet it was
derived from is in git at `2b9c6e2` (`design/05-tapedeck.svg`).

The invariants behind it:

- `EditorContent` lays out at a fixed 800x500 and `VarispeedDelayEditor` scales it with a
  single `AffineTransform`, so every number in `resized()` and `paint()` is a coordinate
  off the design sheet. The footer zoom box and the corner resizer only resize the editor.
- Fonts go through `uiFont`/`monoFont`, which use `withPointHeight`, so a size in the code
  is the size on the sheet - `withHeight` would come out about 15 % small.
- Knob extras ride on component properties the look-and-feel reads: `"split"` is where the
  feedback arc turns red, `"alert"` turns a whole value arc red. Colours stay in
  `LookAndFeel.cpp`; the editor only publishes state.
- `paint()` reads a snapshot the 30 Hz timer refreshes, and the timer calls `repaint()`
  only when that snapshot changes, so an idle UI is not repainting thirty times a second.
- The time knob has no `SliderAttachment`. It rides the millisecond scale in both modes and
  writes `time_div` in sync through `snapValue`, never `setValue` mid-drag, and both of its
  parameter attachments ignore incoming values while the knob is held. That is what stops a
  drag fighting the float round trip through the parameter.
- `ValueField`'s label text is what seeds its editor, so it carries the unit. A field whose
  unit the parameter's `getValueForText` cannot parse needs its own `onEdit` - that is why
  delay time and speed have one.

## Conventions

- Zero warnings. Verify with a Release build before committing.
- No allocation, locks or I/O on the audio thread.
- Self-documenting code, no comments unless critical. Minimal diffs.
- Commits: imperative, short, no period.
- JUCE Font API: `juce::FontOptions`, not the deprecated float constructor.
- **ASCII only in string literals.** `juce::String (const char*)` decodes as Latin-1, not
