# Contributor Guide

## Repository purpose

Larkin is a local Runtime Host that connects externally installed `pi`, `codex`, and `claude` runtimes to Feishu. It does not ship a bundled agent runtime. Keep changes within the current product and repository boundaries.

## Public directory map

- `src/`: product source, grouped by runtime, platform, application, agent, Feishu, setup, and dashboard domains.
- `assets/`: static assets used by the product.
- `scripts/`: build, release, publication, license, and maintenance tooling.
- `test/`: unit, integration, end-to-end, and explicitly opt-in live tests.
- `.github/workflows/`: continuous integration and release workflows.

## Development and validation

Use Bun 1.3.14 and the locked dependency graph:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun run test
bun run licenses:check
bun run publication:check:tree
bun run publication:check
```

Keep each change focused. Update the closest tests when behavior changes, and run the smallest relevant test first followed by the full suite before delivery. Do not weaken clean-tree, publication, license, security, or release checks to make a change pass.

### npm distribution surface

The npm package keeps a Bun-first runtime surface, but its install/invocation glue (`scripts/npm/install-binary.mjs` and `scripts/npm/larkin-bin-shim.mjs`) intentionally runs under Node. npm only guarantees Node at install time, and the postinstall binary download plus the `bin` shim must work without Bun so npm users do not need to install it. Node shebangs are therefore allowed only for those two files; `test/integration/build/bun-only-runtime-contract.test.mjs` enforces this single exception.

## Feishu / lark-cli command shape

For any Feishu-related operation, prefer the official `lark-cli` command and flags over a Larkin-invented shortcut. This applies to reads, writes, and other domain commands, not only IM write entries.

- If official CLI already has a command such as `im messages urgent_app`, protect or wrap that exact path. Do not invent a parallel `+messages-...` surface just to make freshness or identity easier.
- Wrapper gates may probe, deny, or inject Runtime-locked identity such as `--as bot`. They must not rename the user-facing command or invent extra required flags that official CLI does not have.
- Do not invent wrapper-only features that official `lark-cli` does not have. If the official command has no idempotency key, do not add a local sent/sending ledger or a synthetic `--idempotency-key` just because a review asked for retries to be unique.
- Keep `+` shortcuts only where official `lark-cli` already defines them, for example `+messages-send` and `+messages-reply`.
- Phone and SMS urgent remain out of scope unless the Owner explicitly authorizes them.

## End-to-end tests

Every requirement should have an end-to-end test that exercises the real command path, not only a classifier or prompt grep. Prefer the smallest test that still proves the change took effect: launcher/integration through `runLarkCli` or the hosted gate first; add an opt-in live test only when the claim depends on Feishu, Windows, npm, or another external system. Fake or API success must not be written as client-visible proof.

## Prompt engineering

When tuning the Larkin standing prompt (`src/agent/context-prompt.ts`), follow the two canonical references and the file header notes:

- OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide: <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering>
- Anthropic Prompt Engineering overview: <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview>

Standing rules: prefer structural signals (target/source fields) over model inference; give exact recipe templates plus constraints; keep fail-closed/idempotent/freshness semantics; bump `LARKIN_STANDING_PROMPT_VERSION` on every substantive change and update the affected eval datasets, graders, and assertions; validate behavior changes with the fixed-scenario evals. Do not add new Markdown docs; keep guidance as file-header comments or in this file.

## Repository hygiene

Never commit credentials, tokens, private keys, local configuration, user data, private filesystem paths, or restricted publication inputs. Do not commit generated `dist/`, release `artifacts/`, dependency directories, or local caches. The repository intentionally contains no `docs/` or `.claude/` tree; do not add unapproved Markdown files.

## License and releases

Contributions intentionally submitted for inclusion are licensed under Apache-2.0 as described by the repository `LICENSE` and its contribution terms.

Owner policy: every bugfix or feature delivery must increment the version in `package.json` before merge. Unless the Owner explicitly selects a minor or major increment, default to exactly one patch increment. If the delivery already includes the required increment relative to its base, do not increment it again in a release-only follow-up.
