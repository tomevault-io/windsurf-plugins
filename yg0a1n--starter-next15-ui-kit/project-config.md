description: Enforce consistent naming conventions for React components and their files. This rule ensures that filenames are in kebab-case and component names are in PascalCase.
---


File Naming (`kebab-case`)
- **Rule**: Files containing a React component must be named in `kebab-case`.
- **Example**: `navigation-bar.tsx`, `theme-switch.tsx`

Component Naming (`PascalCase`)
- **Rule**: The React component exported from the file must be named in `PascalCase`.
- **Example**: `export default function NavigationBar() { ... }`

Concrete Example
- **File**: `home-page.tsx`
- **Component**: `function HomePage() { ... }`
