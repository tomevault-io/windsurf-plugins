## Pull request review

Do not comment on unresolved pull request template placeholders in the PR description. Please also read and follow
AGENTS.md.

In particular, ignore placeholders like:

- `Fixes # <!-- link to a relevant issue. -->`
- empty or commented issue-link sections from the pull request template

This repository does not require every pull request to be linked to an issue. Only mention a missing issue link if the
code changes clearly require issue tracking context.
