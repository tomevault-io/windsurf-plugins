# Working in this repository

This repository holds one guideline (`architecture.md`), a lens
catalog derived from it (`lenses/`), Claude Code skills that apply the
lenses (`skills/`), and the checkers that keep the three consistent
(`scripts/`, `Makefile`).

## Layout

- `architecture.md` is the source of truth. Every rule in a lens or a
  skill restates a sentence in it; nothing adds a rule the guideline
  does not state.
- `lenses/<group>.md` holds one group of lenses in the format
  `lenses/README.md` defines. Ids are `<PREFIX>-NN`; every lens cites
  `Section title, Subsection`, by title and never by number.
- `skills/arch-review-<group>/SKILL.md` is generated from
  `skills/_template/review.SKILL.md`; edit the template and run
  `make gen-skills`. The other skills are hand-written and share
  `skills/_shared/scaffold-conventions.md`. `skills/arch-new-aspect`
  is the one skill that edits this repository itself: it incorporates
  a new aspect into the guideline and cascades it through the lenses,
  skills, docs, and changelog.
- `agents/arch-reviewer.md` is the subagent `arch-review-full` fans out
  to. Its procedure and report shape mirror the review template by
  hand; a change to one is a change to both. The sentence "Never
  edit, stage, or commit" is repeated in every review skill on
  purpose.
- `.claude-plugin/` holds the plugin and marketplace manifests. The
  repository root is the plugin.

## Invariants

- No product, hardware, or assistant-tooling vocabulary in the
  guideline or the lenses (`scripts/check_leaks.py` lists the terms).
- No history in the guideline: it states what we do, in the present
  tense, with no rejected alternatives and no changelog phrasing.
- No em-dashes anywhere.
- No section numbers anywhere: headings are unnumbered, and every
  cross-reference (in the guideline, the lenses, the skills, the docs)
  names the section by title; inside the guideline it is a named
  anchor link. Numbers shift when a section is inserted; titles do not.
- The guideline's Contents block is generated (`make gen-toc`) and
  checked (`make toc`).
- Every lens cites a section and subsection that exist.
- Every skill's `name` equals its folder name and starts with `arch-`;
  every `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/...` reference resolves; descriptions are
  double-quoted; `allowed-tools` is comma-separated in the
  `Bash(cmd:*)` form and names only what the skill runs.
- Scaffold skills share `skills/_shared/scaffold-conventions.md` and
  have the same sections: Input, Created, Changed, Procedure, Output.
- Exactly one review skill per lens group; `arch-review-full` names all
  of them.

## Validate

```bash
make check                       # everything CI runs
claude plugin validate . --strict   # manifests, skills, agents (when claude is installed)
```

## Conventions

- Wrap prose at about 72 columns in the guideline and the lenses.
- A concept the guideline uses before the section that defines it
  carries a named anchor link to that section at its first mention.
- A code snippet that shows a root with "one getter per X" shows two
  getters and a `# ...` line, so the pattern reads at a glance.
- When a fix is applied to one instance, search the repository for
  its siblings and fix them in the same change.
- Commit messages: a specific subject line, a short body naming the
  rule that changed and why.
- A change that removes or reverses a rule is a major release; one
  that adds or sharpens a rule is a minor release. Record it in
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
