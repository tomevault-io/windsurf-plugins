# OMPChamber Agent Guide

## Purpose

OMPChamber provides shared web, desktop, VS Code, hosted-mobile, and native-mobile UI surfaces for OpenCode.

This file contains only always-on repository rules and routing. Detailed workflows belong to project skills and module documentation.

## Instruction Order

These steps are mandatory. Before editing, you **MUST**:

1. Follow this root guide.
2. Load every matching project skill and every task-required reference from
   those skills.
3. Read the nearest `DOCUMENTATION.md` and package `README.md` when present.
4. Follow local code and test precedent.

If these sources materially conflict, stop and resolve the conflict instead of silently choosing one.
Do not start editing when a matching skill or required reference has not been
read. Skill loading is a required part of the task, not optional guidance.

## Runtime Boundaries

- `packages/ui`: shared React UI, state, sync, and runtime contracts.
- `packages/web`: web surfaces, OMPChamber server, managed/external OpenCode lifecycle, and CLI.
- `packages/electron`: native desktop shell and privileged Electron boundary.
- `packages/vscode`: extension host, webview, and runtime bridge.
- `packages/mobile`: Capacitor iOS/Android shell; bundles the mobile web surface and connects to an existing OMPChamber server.
- `packages/docs`: product documentation; not a Bun workspace.

Shared UI calls official OpenCode APIs through `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2`. OMPChamber-owned capabilities use `RuntimeAPIs`, `runtimeFetch`, and shared browser/realtime transport helpers. Server-side upstream integrations may use their owning runtime modules.

Electron starts the OMPChamber backend in-process, never as a sidecar. Development may load loopback/HMR UI; packaged builds load staged assets through `ompchamber-ui://` while the loopback server remains the API backend. Keep domain backends in web/runtime modules unless behavior is inherently native.

Shared contracts must define intentional behavior for every applicable runtime: web, desktop, VS Code, hosted mobile, and Capacitor mobile.

## Always-On Constraints

- Do not modify `../opencode`; it is a separate repository.
- Do not run git or GitHub commands unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not add dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Never add or log secrets, bearer tokens, pairing credentials, or sensitive user data.
- Keep changes minimal and preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Enforce security and correctness in core/runtime logic, not only UI visibility or prompts.
- Keep entrypoints and bridges thin; place domain logic in focused owning modules.
- Update owning documentation when module ownership, contracts, or invariants change.

## Correctness Invariants

- Prefer authoritative state over heuristics.
- Derive live activity from live channels, not persisted history.
- Scope temporary fallbacks narrowly and clear them when authoritative state arrives.
- Never let fetch failure masquerade as authoritative empty success.
- Make partial results, rollback, cleanup, and stale-data behavior explicit.
- One failed entity must not erase or block unrelated complete entities.
- Runtime-specific differences must be intentional and visible in code.

## Documentation Discovery

Before changing a module, search for the nearest `DOCUMENTATION.md`; before package-level work, read its `README.md`. Discover docs dynamically under `packages/**/DOCUMENTATION.md` rather than relying on a static exhaustive map.

High-value anchors:

- Sync: `packages/ui/src/sync/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Stores: `packages/ui/src/stores/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- CLI: `packages/web/bin/lib/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Performance measurement tooling: `scripts/perf/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- VS Code runtime: `packages/vscode/src/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Electron: `packages/electron/README.md`
- Mobile: `packages/mobile/README.md`

## Project Skills

Project skills live under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`. You **MUST** load every
skill matching the character of the change before editing; multiple skills may
apply, including companion skills required by another skill. Read every
task-required reference named by those skills. Skills are canonical for their
detailed workflows and checklists. Treating this table as optional advice is a
process violation.

| Trigger | Required skill |
|---|---|
| Any source, dependency, export, build-config, generated-asset, package-contract, or module-ownership change | `ompchamber-change-discipline` |
| CLI commands, prompts, terminal output, non-TTY, `--quiet`, or `--json` behavior | `clack-cli-patterns` |
| Shared UI data access, OpenCode SDK, `RuntimeAPIs`, runtime fetch/auth/URLs, bridges/proxies, runtime switching, or server API routes | `ui-api-decoupling` |
| Electron main/preload, IPC, native UI, updater, deep links, SSH/tunnels, packaging, or child processes | `desktop-shell` |
| Session sync, bootstrap/reconnect, reducers, polling, optimistic state, queues, live status, reconciliation, or directory-scoped caches | `sync-state-invariants` |
| Render/store/event hot paths, large lists, caching/indexing, high CPU/memory, lag, jank, freezes, or performance regressions | `performance-engineering` |
