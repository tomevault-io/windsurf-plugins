# MSDL — Claude Context

## Project

Open-source Windows ISO downloader. React + Go. Live at msdl.tech-latest.com.
Frontend on Cloudflare Pages, backend on Hetzner via Coolify.
Outbound Microsoft API calls route through a Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare-worker/worker.js`)
controlled by `CF_WORKER_URL` + `CF_WORKER_SECRET` env vars on the backend.

## Conventions

- Small config/one-liner fixes → commit directly to main
- Any meaningful feature or multi-file change → feature branch → PR → merge
- GitHub issues are for bugs and community contributions only — planned features tracked here and in PROGRESS.md
- Commit messages follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- **Always test locally before committing or pushing** — research feasibility before implementing (e.g. file size was planned but Microsoft CDN doesn't return it; caught after commit)

## Backlog (implement when ready, in priority order)

### #12 — Two-layer in-memory caching ✅ DONE (feat/caching-layer, merged)

All 7 items shipped: singleflight, SKU cache (7d TTL), link cache (dynamic TTL from `se` param),
negative cache (60s), dynamic TTL, stale-on-failure, jitter. Verified in production.

### Beyond #12 — Observability & resilience

- [x] **Cache hit/miss logging** — logged on every request (fetched vs cached, cached until timestamp).
- [x] **`/metrics` endpoint** (auth-protected) — exposes cache hit rate, miss count, stale serves. Auth via `METRICS_SECRET` env var. (feat/metrics, merged)
- [x] **README architecture section** — caching layer, `/metrics`, env vars documented.
- [ ] **Per-IP / per-product rate limiter** — deferred; revisit after 1 month of production traffic data.

### Frontend UX improvements ✅ DONE (feat/ux-improvements, merged — v1.2.0)

- [x] **Expiry countdown** — parses `se` param from signed URL where available; falls back to "24 hours" for consumer links (Microsoft doesn't include `se` in consumer CDN URLs).
- [x] **Refresh links** — `?force=true` on `/proxy` bypasses cache, fetches fresh from Microsoft. Button shown when under 6h remaining.
- [x] **CLI command tabs** — wget / curl / aria2 tabs, persists selection in localStorage. Replaces old aria2-only tip. Applied to both consumer and eval pages.
- [x] **Recently viewed** — localStorage only. Shows on homepage. Consumer + eval pages both tracked. Expired state shown when link expiry known.
- ~~**File size**~~ — not feasible. Microsoft CDN does not return file size in the API response.

### Sentinel WAF resilience (ongoing)

Confirmed via three weekly `/metrics` + docker-log checkpoints (2026-07-14 → 07-21 → 07-31):
the backend's own direct link-fetch (`/proxy` → Microsoft) is **100% blocked**, permanently —
`link.ms_fetches: 0` every time, and zero even-attempted-and-failed fetches in the raw logs
(the lockdown gate short-circuits before reaching that code path). The site stays alive
entirely on cached/stale entries plus CLI-contributed links (286 accepted, 0 rejected,
confirmed 2026-07-31). `/skuinfo` and `/evallinks` are unaffected — only the download-link
endpoint is targeted.

The CLI's own residential-IP requests also see a stable ~20% Sentinel rejection rate across
all three checkpoints — not improving, not worsening. Microsoft's own API error response
literally names the system (`"Sentinel marked this request as rejected."`, `Type: 9` in
`Errors[]`), confirming it's a real, named product, not our guess. The clean structured-JSON
deny (not an HTML/JS challenge page) suggests a signature/reputation gate rather than full
interactive bot-management — TLS ClientHello fingerprinting is a plausible contributing
signal, since Go's stdlib `crypto/tls` doesn't look like any real browser, independent of IP.

- [x] **Back off Sentinel retries** — bumped `lockdownTTL` 90min → 5h (`backend/main.go`).
      181 retries over 17 days, 0 successes; retrying that often was pure noise.
      (fix/sentinel-lockdown-and-proxy-validation, merged)
- [x] **Validate `product_id` in `/proxy`** — was passing unknown IDs straight through to a
      real Microsoft session attempt (found via a stray `product_id=2861`, never a real
      product, in the logs). Now rejected with 404 before any outbound call. (same PR, merged)
- [x] **CLI TLS/HTTP2 fingerprint hardening** — swapped the CLI's transport from stdlib
      `net/http` to `github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client` (wraps `utls` with a maintained Chrome
      profile). Shipped in `cli/v0.3.7` (merged, released 2026-07-31). **Checked in on
      2026-08-17, 17 days post-release: inconclusive-to-negative.** Aggregate CLI
      Sentinel-rejection rate is still ~21%, statistically unchanged from every pre-fix
      checkpoint. Real caveat: mixed-version population (`0.3.6`: 1156 actions vs `0.3.7`: 493
      in that window) means a `0.3.7`-only improvement could still be masked — `/metrics`
      doesn't break the error down by CLI version, so this can't be fully isolated yet. Revisit
      once `0.3.7`+ dominates usage share; if the aggregate still hasn't moved by then, treat
      the fingerprint theory as disproven.
- [ ] **`/needs-warming` community page** — proposed, not built. Surfaces products currently
      failing web users (active Sentinel/rate-limit lockdown, no cached/stale link available)
