# AI Workstation - Docker Swarm Hybrid Architecture ✅

This project provides a comprehensive AI development environment using Docker Swarm with GPU-accelerated services. The stack includes Open WebUI with RAG capabilities, Ollama for LLM inference, ComfyUI for image generation, vector database, automation tools, and a mobile-responsive navigation interface.

## ✅ Project Structure Scaffolded
- Docker Swarm services for CPU workloads
- Separate Docker Compose for GPU services (ComfyUI)
- Traefik reverse proxy with port-based routing
- Mobile navigation interface for iPhone/mobile access
- Comprehensive RAG pipeline with document processing

## ✅ Key Components Configured
- Open WebUI: Chat interface with RAG document upload
- Ollama: Local LLM inference engine
- ComfyUI: Stable Diffusion image generation (GPU)
- Qdrant: Vector database for RAG embeddings
- n8n: Workflow automation platform
- Docling: Advanced document processing
- Traefik: Reverse proxy and load balancer
- Mobile Navigation: Responsive interface for mobile access

## ✅ Development Guidelines Established
- Use hybrid architecture: Swarm for CPU, Compose for GPU
- Port allocation: 8081-8095 for main services
- Environment variables for configuration override
- Proper network isolation with overlay networks
- Mobile-first responsive design for navigation

## ✅ GitHub Repository Ready
- Complete documentation and setup scripts
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Issue templates and PR templates
- Contributing guidelines
- MIT License
