# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

GodotMaker is an ECS-native text-to-game framework for Godot. It uses gecs (open-source ECS addon) with AI working in the GDScript layer. The project generates complete Godot game projects from natural language descriptions via a multi-agent pipeline.

## Repository Structure

```
hooks/              8 Python hook scripts + hooks/metrics/ subsystem
skills/
  core/             role-based gm-* skills + supporting skills (gecs, godot-api, ...)
    _shared/        cross-skill reference docs (see "Shared reference docs" below)
  reviewer/         8 reviewer skills (physics, animation, ui, etc.)
shell/              publish.sh / publish.ps1, report.sh / report.bat
tools/              publish.py, check_env.py, check_project.py, asset_source_generate.py, etc.
config/             config.yaml.default, stage_schemas.json, addon_versions.json
agent-runtimes/     runner-specific references, templates, and hook config
templates/          PLAN/STRUCTURE/ASSETS/SCENES/MEMORY/GDD templates + game-claude.md
docs/               hooks.md, wiki/, update/
```

## Shared reference docs (`skills/core/_shared/`)

Reference docs consumed by more than one skill (e.g. `worker-dispatch.md`
used by `gm-build` and `gm-fixgap`) live in `skills/core/_shared/` as the
single source of truth. `publish_shared_refs()` deploys each entry from
`_shared/manifest.json` into every consumer's `references/` directory.

- **Edit only the source** under `_shared/<file>`. Deployed copies carry an
  `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->` header and are overwritten on every publish.
- Inside SKILL.md, reference shared docs as `references/<file>` (the
  deployed path). Never write `_shared/<file>` — that path doesn't exist
  at runtime.

For the manifest schema, add/remove flows, and publish debugging see
`docs/contributing/shared-refs.md`.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Run tests (193+ tests)
python -m pytest tests/ -x -q

# Publish to a game project
python tools/publish.py <target_dir>
python tools/publish.py --force <target_dir>

# Check environment
python tools/check_env.py
```

## How Publish Works

`publish.py` deploys skills, hooks, tools, config, and templates into a target game project:
- Skills → `.claude/skills/`
- Hooks → `.godotmaker/hooks/` (git-tracked, available in worktrees)
- Settings → `.claude/settings.json` (only on fresh install or `--force`)
- Version stamped in `.godotmaker/version`

## Skill System (Three Layers)

- **Layer 1 — Core**:
  - **9 pipeline skills** (run in tag iteration): `gm-scaffold` (once), then per tag: `gm-gdd → gm-asset → gm-build → gm-verify → gm-evaluate → gm-fixgap (loop) → gm-accept → gm-finalize`
  - **1 out-of-pipeline skill**: `gm-rescue` — diagnostic-only, invoked manually when the pipeline is stuck; checks whether the blockage is a godotmaker defect; never modifies game code
  - **Supporting skills**: game-planner, project-scaffold, godot-api, gecs, input-mapper, headless-build, gdunit-driver, godot-e2e, visual-qa, screenshot, mcp-driver
- **Layer 2 — Reviewer** (8 skills): physics, animation, ui, tilemap, navigation, shader, audio, particles — each has SKILL.md + gotchas.md + checklist.md
- **Layer 3 — Pattern**: per game genre (deferred)

## Tag-iterative pipeline

Each game project ships in **SemVer-tagged release tags** (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, …). One full pipeline pass produces one tag. `ROADMAP.md` lists the planned tags; the earliest entry without a `git tag` is the **current tag**, and the per-tag root documents (`PLAN.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `SCENES.md`) are scoped to it. `gm-finalize` archives the tag's working docs to `docs/tags/<tag>/`, runs `git tag <tag>`, and resets per-tag runtime state for the next round.

Cross-tag (root, accumulating): `GDD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `ASSETS.md` (assets are reusable across tags; each row carries a `Tag` column marking the introducing tag).
Per-tag (root, overwritten each `/gm-gdd`): `PLAN.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `SCENES.md`.
Per-tag archives (immutable once sealed): `docs/tags/<tag>/`.

## Versioning

- `VERSION` file at repo root (semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- `CHANGELOG.md` tracks all changes
- Publish compares versions and prompts on MINOR/MAJOR upgrades

## Language

- All conversations, explanations, and communication with the user must be in Chinese
- Code, comments, and commit messages should be in English
