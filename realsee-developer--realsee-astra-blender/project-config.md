# Working in this reference project

- Keep the main tutorial focused on using Realsee exports with a local AI agent and Blender. Space modeling comes before furniture and small props.
- Resolve project paths from the repository root. Discover Blender through PATH or an explicit executable argument.
- Start with `README.md`, `prompts/quickstart.en.md`, and `docs/code-map.en.md`.
- `tools/` contains the standalone preparation helpers. `scripts/` is curated case-study code with scene-specific inputs and historical output dependencies; read its navigation before executing anything.
- Do not run all case scripts or import them as a test suite. Some operate on a loaded Blender scene or write output at module load time.
- Preserve original input data and existing models. Use a separate output copy for experiments and edit tests.
- The explicitly authorized original case inputs in `data/` are published as-is through Git LFS, including on-site QR codes; see `data/README.md`. Preserve these files and their original directories. Keep other users’ private inputs out of Git unless explicitly authorized and reviewed for publication. Keep environments, credentials, intermediate models, and render sequences out of Git. New public case scripts must be added to the explicit list in `.gitignore` and documented.
- For preparation-tool changes, run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and `python3 tools/check_public_tree.py`. For Blender execution changes, also run `python3 tools/project.py smoke` when Blender is available.
- Report checks actually executed. A synthetic environment test does not establish full reconstruction or visual equivalence.
- Original case inputs, public preview assets, and Git LFS models have separate material/provenance notes in `docs/data-and-license.md`; the source materials are not covered by the code’s MIT license. Existing public models and video remain the previously reviewed, redacted copies. Do not publish additional external data or credentials as a side effect of testing.
