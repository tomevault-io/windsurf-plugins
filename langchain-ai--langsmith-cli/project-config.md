# AGENTS.md

## Repository overview

`langsmith-cli` is an agent-first Go CLI for querying and managing LangSmith resources. It uses Cobra for commands and the generated [`langsmith-go`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-go) SDK for LangSmith API access.

- `cmd/langsmith/`: CLI entry point.
- `internal/cmd/`: commands, flags, and command tests.
- `internal/client/`: shared LangSmith client setup.
- `internal/output/`: JSON, table, and tree output helpers.
- `scripts/`: installation scripts.
- `README.md`: installation, authentication, command, local-development, and release documentation.

## Development

The module targets the Go version declared in `go.mod`.

- Build: `make build`
- Format: `make fmt`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Vet: `make vet`
- Focused test: `go test ./internal/cmd -run '<TestName>'`

Keep commands scriptable and preserve established output formats. Add focused tests for new commands, flags, request parameters, and output behavior.

A command that selects a project takes both `--project` and `--project-id`; register the pair with `addProjectFlags` (or `addCommonFilterFlags`, which calls it) and resolve it with `resolveSessionID`. Callers building a command line programmatically should pass the UUID, since project names are user-authored and may contain shell metacharacters. `TestEveryProjectCommandAcceptsProjectID` fails if a new command offers only one of the two.

## LangSmith API access

Use the generated Go SDK through the shared client's `SDK` field. Do not add raw API calls when the endpoint is available in `langsmith-go`, and do not copy existing raw-call patterns for new code.

If an endpoint is missing from the Go SDK, expose and configure it through the public OpenAPI and Stainless definitions in `langchain-ai/langchainplus`, release the generated `langsmith-go` client, and update this repository's SDK dependency. Prefer that workflow over adding `RawGet`, `RawPost`, `RawPatch`, or other direct HTTP calls.

## Releasing

Releases are tag-driven: pushing a `v*` tag builds and publishes the GitHub Release, so there is no version file or changelog to edit. See [Releasing](README.md#releasing) for the full procedure.
