# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in the `visual-base` distribution.

## What this repo is

A Bub distribution published to PyPI as a single `visual-base` package.
It bundles the framework plus two plugins (`bub-kimi`, `bub-eye`) as
top-level modules inside the same wheel. It is **not** the core
framework (`bub`) and **not** the community plugin monorepo
(`bub-contrib`) — those are separate upstreams.

The sibling checkouts `../bub/` and `../bub-contrib/` are independent
git repos used for reference. Never edit them from here.

## Package layout

```
pyproject.toml       # hatchling build, publishes visual-base to PyPI
LICENSE              # MIT
src/visual_base/     # distribution-level defaults and version
src/bub_kimi/        # Kimi CLI plugin (entry-point: bub.kimi)
src/bub_eye/         # Screen-capture plugin (entry-point: bub.eye)
src/skills/          # Builtin skills shipped with the wheel
tests/               # One test file per plugin
```

The three top-level packages (`bub_kimi`, `bub_eye`, `skills`) are
bundled into the single `visual-base` distribution via
`[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel].packages`. Do not re-introduce a
workspace — everything lives inside the one wheel.

## Dependency rules

- `bub>=0.3.6,<0.4` — track upstream PyPI releases. Bump the floor when
  you need new framework APIs; bump the ceiling when bub makes a breaking
  minor release.
- `loguru`, `pydantic-settings`, and `imageio-ffmpeg` are always
  installed — `bub_eye` imports them at plugin-load time, even on Linux
  where the channel then reports `enabled=False`. `imageio-ffmpeg` ships
  prebuilt wheels (≈20–30 MB) for every platform we target, so the
  cross-platform cost is small and we avoid a runtime `uv pip install`
  dance.
- **One optional auto-install left.** `kimi-cli` is a separate uv tool
  (an application, not a Python library), so `bub_kimi.plugin._ensure_kimi_installed`
  still runs `uv tool install kimi-cli` lazily on first use, guarded by a
  module-level flag, raising `RuntimeError` with an actionable message if
  `uv` is missing or the install fails.

## Plugin platform rules

`bub_eye` requires macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon both supported —
`avfoundation` input and `hevc_videotoolbox` hardware HEVC are available
on every Mac we target). On Linux / Windows `EyeChannel.enabled` returns
`False` after a log line and `resolve_ffmpeg` is never called — the
bundled `imageio-ffmpeg` binary just sits unused.

The `-pixel_format nv12` + `-framerate 1` avfoundation hints were tuned
on Intel Mac to cut RSS from ~267 MB to ~96 MB (see `ffmpeg.py`
docstring). Apple Silicon behavior is expected to be equivalent, but if
the hints ever stop applying cleanly there, functionality stays intact —
ffmpeg just falls back to a BGRA→YUV swscale pass at a memory cost.

## Publishing to PyPI

Releases are driven by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, triggered by
pushing a `v<version>` tag. The workflow:

1. Runs ruff + pytest.
2. Checks the tag matches `project.version` in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Builds sdist + wheel via `uv build`.
4. Publishes via PyPI trusted publisher (OIDC, environment `pypi`).

Before the first release, configure a Pending publisher on PyPI
pointing at `oilbeater/visual-base` → `release.yml` → environment `pypi`.
Bumping the version: edit `pyproject.toml`, commit, `git tag vX.Y.Z`,
`git push --tags`.

## Branch policy

This repo is an exception to the user's global rule: commit directly to
`main` by default. Only branch off into `feat/*` / `fix/*` when the user
explicitly asks (or when the change clearly warrants a review cycle —
e.g. cross-repo coordination, risky migrations).

## Commit policy

Every commit must carry `Signed-off-by: Mengxin Liu <liumengxinfly@gmail.com>`.
