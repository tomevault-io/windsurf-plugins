# CLAUDE.md

## Project overview

Python monorepo managed with **uv workspaces**.
The core framework lives in `agents-core/` and plugins live in `plugins/` (37+ packages).
Python >= 3.10, 3.12 recommended.

## Commands

All commands use `uv`. Never use `python -m`. If you run into dependency issues, stop and ask.

```bash
# Full check (ruff + mypy + unit tests)
uv run --no-sync dev.py check

# Unit tests only (--no-sync avoids uv panic in sandboxed environments)
uv run --no-sync pytest -m "not integration"

# Integration tests (needs .env secrets)
uv run --no-sync pytest -m "integration"

# Lint & format
uv run --no-sync ruff check .
uv run --no-sync ruff format .

# Type check
uv run --no-sync mypy
```

## Testing

- Framework: pytest. Never mock.
- `@pytest.mark.asyncio` is not needed (asyncio_mode = auto).
- Integration tests use `@pytest.mark.integration`.
- NEVER adjust `sys.path`.
- Keep unit-tests for the class under the same test class. Do not spread them around different test classes. For example, tests for `Agent` must be inside `TestAgent`, etc.
- ALWAYS test behavior, not calling a path.
- Use pytest.fixture for test setup, not helper methods
- NEVER observe method calls in tests; assert on outputs and state.

## Python rules

- Never use `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Never write `except Exception as e`. Catch specific exceptions.
- Avoid `getattr`, `hasattr`, `delattr`, `setattr`; prefer normal attribute access.
- Docstrings: Google style, keep them short.
- Do not use section comments like `# -- some section --`
- Prefer `logger.exception()` when logging an error with a traceback instead of `logger.error("Error: {exc}")`
- Do not use local imports, import at the top of the module
- Avoid `# type: ignore` comments.
- Avoid using `Any` type.
- When adding code to an existing file, follow the patterns already established in that file (e.g. error handling style, import guards, naming).

## Code style

### Imports:

- ordered as: stdlib, third-party, local package, relative. Use `TYPE_CHECKING` guard for imports only needed by type annotations.
- Never import from private modules (`_foo`) outside of the package's own `__init__.py`. Use the public re-export (e.g. `from vision_agents.testing import TestResponse`, not
  `from vision_agents.testing._run_result import TestResponse`).

### Naming:

- private attributes and methods use a leading underscore (`_sessions`, `_warmup_agent`). Public API is plain snake_case.

### Type annotations:

- use them everywhere. Modern syntax: `X | Y` unions, `dict[str, T]` generics, full `Callable` signatures, `Optional` for nullable params.

### Logging:

module-level `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Use `debug` for lifecycle, `info` for notable events, `error` for failures without a traceback,
`exception` for errors with traceback.

- In hot paths (audio processing, event handling), guard debug logging behind `if logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):` to avoid formatting overhead when debug is disabled.

### Constructor validation:

- raise `ValueError` with a descriptive message for invalid args. Prefer custom domain exceptions over generic ones.

### Async patterns:

- async-first lifecycle methods (`start`/`stop`). Support `__aenter__`/`__aexit__` for context manager usage.
- Use `asyncio.Lock`, `asyncio.Task`, `asyncio.gather` for concurrency.
- Clean up resources in `finally` blocks.

### Method order:

- `__init__`, public lifecycle methods, properties, public feature methods, private helpers, dunder methods.

### Other

- Smallest possible diff. Prefer deleting code over adding it.
- Don't add error handling, logging, validation, comments, abstractions, config options, or "future-proofing" I didn't
  ask for.
- Match the style and abstraction level of surrounding code. Don't introduce new patterns or helpers unless asked.
- Fix root causes, not symptoms. No try/except to swallow bugs.
- Change only what I asked for. Don't refactor adjacent code — ask first.
- Do not remove valid comments when editing/refactoring code.

## Token efficiency

- When making multiple related changes to the same file, combine them into fewer Edit calls with enough surrounding context, rather than one edit per change.
- Run tests with Bash directly. Only use subagents for test runs when you need to do other work in parallel.
- Only use TodoWrite for tasks with 5+ steps. Don't update it after every individual edit.

## Changelog

- Lives in `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root.
- Organised by version heading (`# v0.4.0`), then sections: **Breaking Changes**, **New Features**, **Bug Fixes**.
- Only include user-facing changes (public API breaks, features, fixes). Skip docs-only and CI-only commits.
- Reference PR numbers inline, e.g. `(#374)`.
- To generate: `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges`, then classify each commit.
