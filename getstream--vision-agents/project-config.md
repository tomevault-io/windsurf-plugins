never mock. 
tests use pytest. 
never adjust sys.path.

never write: except Exception as e
avoid using getattr, hasattr, delattr and setattr; prefer normal attribute access.

docstrings should follow the google style guides for docstrings.

integration tests use
@pytest.mark.integration

@pytest.mark.asyncio is not needed (its automatic)
