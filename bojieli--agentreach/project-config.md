# Gemini CLI (Google)

Open-source TypeScript agent by Google.  Installed as `gemini` CLI.

## The shell seam

Gemini CLI resolves its shell in `packages/core/src/tools/shell.ts` via
`getShellConfiguration()`, which returns the bare name `"bash"`.  Node's
`child_process.spawn` resolves that name by walking PATH — the same mechanism
every tool that calls `execvp("bash")` relies on.  The reach PATH shim places a
controlled `bash` binary earlier on PATH, so the shim intercepts every
`run_shell_command` call natively, with no patching and no env-var tricks.

This is the cleanest possible seam: the interception point is PATH itself, a
standard POSIX guarantee that every process respects.

It also has a failure mode worth naming, because reach hit it. Gemini is often
installed behind a wrapper script — npm writes one, and so do asdf, pyenv and
nvm — and those wrappers begin `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. With the shim first on
PATH, `env` resolves that `bash` to the shim, so reach is asked to run the
wrapper. reach hands it to the real shell, which is right; what mattered was
that it used to hand it over with its own shim directory stripped from PATH and
`REACH_IN_SHELL_SHIM` set, and gemini inherited both. Every `run_shell_command`
after that ran on the operator's machine while being reported as remote. The
pass-through now changes nothing about the environment, and
`TestShimPassthroughLeavesTheSeamArmed` fails if that regresses.

## File tools: excluded via settings.json

Gemini CLI exposes a large set of built-in tools that call Node's `fs` module
directly, bypassing the shell: `read_file`, `write_file`, `replace` (the file
editor), `glob`, `grep_search`, `list_directory`, `read_many_files`, `web_fetch`,
`google_web_search`, `write_todos`, `activate_skill`, and others.  These must not
be advertised to the model, because they act on the local filesystem — not the
session target — and have no intercept point.

`reach gemini` sets `HOME` to a managed directory whose `.gemini/settings.json`
contains an `excludeTools` array that names every built-in tool except
`run_shell_command`:

```json
{
  "excludeTools": [
    "read_file", "write_file", "replace", "glob",
    "grep_search", "list_directory", "read_many_files",
    "web_fetch", "google_web_search",
    "write_todos", "activate_skill", "get_internal_docs",
    "ask_user", "enter_plan_mode", "exit_plan_mode",
    "update_topic", "complete_task", "invoke_agent",
    "tracker_create_task", "tracker_update_task", "tracker_get_task",
    "tracker_list_tasks", "tracker_add_dependency", "tracker_visualize",
    "read_mcp_resource", "list_mcp_resources"
  ]
}
```

**Tool name precision matters.**  Gemini CLI matches `excludeTools` entries
against the canonical `TOOL_NAME` constants from
`packages/core/src/tools/definitions/base-declarations.ts`.  Common
shorthands differ from the canonical names and are silently ignored:

| Shorthand (wrong) | Canonical name (correct)   |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `edit`            | `replace`                  |
| `grep`            | `grep_search`              |
| `ls`              | `list_directory`           |
| `web_search`      | `google_web_search`        |

With the managed `HOME`, only `run_shell_command` is visible to the model.
Shell commands route through the PATH shim and execute on the session target.

## Credential forwarding

Gemini CLI reads authentication from `HOME/.gemini/google-accounts.json` (OAuth
flow) or from the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.  reach symlinks
`google-accounts.json` and `installation_id` from the operator's real `~/.gemini`
into the managed `HOME/.gemini`, so OAuth logins remain valid.  `GEMINI_API_KEY`
passes through the environment unchanged.
