# Review guidelines for Github Copilot

When reviewing code:

Fetch the latest version of all the checklists mentioned on https://mozmeao.github.io/platform-docs/code-review/checklists/ - use these as a guide to our project best practices. You may cache these for up to three days at a time.

Read AGENTS.md for supplementary instructions.

If a mirrored copy of these instructions exists at `custom-instructions/repo/.github/copilot-instructions.md`, keep it fully synchronized with this file and any referenced AGENTS.md guidance, including section renumbering and DB schema guidance, or remove it to avoid drift and inconsistent Copilot behavior. If the mirrored version is out of sync, use this version as the canonical source and overwrite the mirrored version.

Try to use Conventional Comments to indicate the kind of feedback you are providing, and whether it's blocking or non-blocking.

Also, confirm in a comment on the PR that you are using this custom instructions file, please.

# Areas to consider when reviewing:

## 1. Correctness & Safety

* Potential bugs, edge cases, or incorrect assumptions
* Error handling (especially around I/O, network calls, and external services)
* Race conditions, concurrency issues, or state inconsistencies
* Security concerns (e.g., injection risks, unsafe deserialization, secrets handling).

Heavily flag changes that add risks to uptime or functionality that do not appear to have been considered in the changeset.
Be particularly aware of CMS-backed content that is not richtext. Ensure it's escaped properly when used in templates.

## 2. Design & Architecture

* Is the code structured in a way that will scale and be maintainable?
* Are responsibilities clearly separated?
* Are abstractions appropriate, or is the code over/under-engineered?
* Does this change align with existing patterns in the codebase?

## 3. Readability & Intent

* Is the intent of the code obvious to a future reader?
* Are names (variables, functions, classes) clear and meaningful?
* Would a short comment help explain _why_ something is done (not _what_)?

## 4. Functionality

* Does the code do what the pull request description says it will?
* Do these changes have any unintended consequences?

## 5. Tests

* Are new behaviors adequately covered by tests?
* Do tests clearly express intent?
* Are edge cases tested where appropriate?
* Flag missing tests, but don’t require tests for trivial changes

## 6. Performance (When Relevant)

* Call out obvious inefficiencies or unnecessary work
* Avoid premature optimization
* Note performance implications only if they are meaningful in context

## 7. Localization (L10N)

* If new strings are added to the codebase that are not marked up as Fluent strings, add a non-blocking comment questioning whether they need to be translated or are OK in just one language.
* Fallback strings may be removed if they have been marked as obsolete and the date for removal has past.
* When passing HTML tags with attributes into strings for translation, put all the attributes and their values in a single variable.
* Em dashes should have a space on either side.

## 8. Accessability (A11y)

* Are accessability best practices in use.
* Semantic HTML - including headings nested appropriately and landmarks.
* Keyboard focus-visible states are added when hover states are added.
* Form control have accessible labels.
* ARIA attributes are only used when native HTML cannot provide the required accessibility.

## 9. Wagtail CMS code

* If you can see a new Wagtail CMS model is being added (specifically, a new Python class that is a subclass of wagtail.models.Page or of AbstractSpringfieldCMSPage, or a Django model class that is decorated or wrapped with with `register_snippet`) please check that the PR has it listed in springfield.settings.base.CMS_ALLOWED_PAGE_MODELS and also in the ./bin/export-db-to-sqlite.sh script.

* If a new Snippet (a Django model decorated with @register_snippet) is added, add a reminder in a comment to ensure that the Editors have permission to see and edit the new Snippet. That permission is added manually via the Wagtail UI.

* If a Django view is being decorated for the first time with the `prefer_cms()` decorator and there is no `fallback_ftl_files=` parameter being passed in to `prefer_cms()`, add a non-blocking comment questioning whether it should be present, because without it, the page will only show the locales available in the CMS in the footer links on the page

* When a block is added to a page's Stream Field or as a child to another block, make sure that the key used to identify the block type is always the same. For example:

```
class ChildBlock(blocks.StructBlock):
    ...

# Right
class ParentBlock(block.StructBlock):
    child_block = ChildBlock()

# Wrong
class AnotherParentBlock(block.StructBlock):
    another_key = ChildBlock()

# Right
class SomePAge(Page):
    field = StreamField([("child_block", ChildBlock())], use_json_field=True)

# Wrong
class OtherPage(Page):
    field = StreamField([("different_key", ChildBlock())], use_json_field=True)
```
