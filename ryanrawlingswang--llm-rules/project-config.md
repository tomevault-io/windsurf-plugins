# Claude Code Instructions

## Stack

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Web app**: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Auth**: Better Auth (email/password, session cookies)
- **API**: tRPC v11 with `publicProcedure` / `protectedProcedure`
- **DB**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (`packages/db`)
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright (e2e)
- **Logging**: `packages/logger` (structured logging — prefer over `console.log`)
- **i18n**: `packages/i18n` (translations via `next-intl`)

## Architecture Principles

### Server-first rendering

- Pages are Server Components by default. Only add `"use client"` to leaf components that need interactivity — browser APIs, event handlers, or hooks.
- Do server-side data fetching in RSC via `getSession()`, tRPC server caller, or server actions. Pass results down as props — do not re-fetch on the client what was already fetched on the server.
- Protect pages at the RSC level (`getSession()` → redirect) _and_ in middleware. Both layers.

### Small, composable components

- One component = one responsibility. If a component has more than ~150 lines, it's doing too much.
- Prefer pure presentational components that receive props over components that fetch their own data.
- Compose complex UIs from small primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Card`) rather than building monolithic page components.
- Co-locate page-specific components in `_components/` next to their route. Shared components go in `src/components/`.
- Follow DRY: extract reusable logic, components, and utilities. On the backend, share via tRPC procedures or shared libraries. On the frontend, share via hooks, components, and utility functions.

### Separation of concerns

```
src/
  app/              ← routing, layouts, pages (thin — orchestrate, don't compute)
    _components/    ← page-scoped components (not shared)
  components/ui/    ← design system primitives (stateless, no data fetching)
  server/api/       ← tRPC routers (application logic, auth, validation — call services)
  server/services/  ← service layer (pure business logic, DB access)
  lib/              ← shared utilities, auth config, constants
  db/               ← DB client + re-exports from packages/db
```

- **Pages** call data functions and pass results to components — no raw DB calls in JSX.
- **tRPC routers** handle auth, input validation, and orchestration. They delegate business logic to service functions.
- **Services** contain pure business logic and DB access. They return result types — never throw for expected failure cases.
- **UI components** are purely presentational. They receive data via props.

### Testable code

- Write functions that are pure and side-effect-free wherever possible.
- Inject dependencies (DB, auth, external clients) via parameters — never import them directly inside business logic functions.
- Unit test pure functions and tRPC procedures. Integration test DB interactions with a real connection (use stubs/fakes for external services, never mocks for database queries).
- E2E test all user-facing features with Playwright (`pnpm test:e2e`).
- Place tests alongside source: `foo.test.ts` next to `foo.ts`.

## Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode always. No `any` unless wrapping an untyped third-party boundary.
- Prefer `unknown` + type guards over `any`.
- Use Zod for all external input validation (tRPC inputs, form data, env vars).
- Define types close to where they're used. Only promote to shared if used in 3+ places.
- Use shared constants and enums from `@/lib/constants` for values used across the app (status codes, role names, etc.).

### Components

- Props interfaces above the component, not inlined.
- Use `React.ComponentProps<"div">` spreads for wrapper components.
- No default exports for components in `components/ui/` — named exports only.
- `"use client"` at the top of the file, not buried inside.

### tRPC

- `protectedProcedure` by default — only use `publicProcedure` when there is an explicit need (e.g. public page with public data, login/signup endpoints).
- Input validation with Zod on every mutation.
- Keep routers single-domain (e.g. `usersRouter`, `postsRouter`).
- Routers handle auth, validation, and request orchestration. Delegate business logic to service functions in `server/services/`.

### Styling

- Tailwind utility classes. No inline `style={{}}` unless setting a CSS variable or dynamic value Tailwind can't express.
- Design system: clean white surfaces (`bg-white`), light borders (`border-[#ebebeb]`), subtle shadows, and `#5B50C8` purple for focus states. Primary brand color is `#231212`. Reference implementations live in `packages/ui/src/`.
- No third-party component libraries (antd, shadcn, etc.) — use the custom components from `packages/ui`.

### Database

- Schema lives in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`. All tables shared across apps go here.
- App-specific tables (if ever needed) go in `apps/webapp/src/db/schema.ts`.
- Never call Drizzle directly from a page or component. Always go through a tRPC procedure or a server action.
- Migrations are generated with `pnpm db:generate` and applied with `pnpm db:migrate`.

### Authentication

- Use `getSession()` (from `@/lib/auth`) to get the session in RSC, middleware, and server actions.
