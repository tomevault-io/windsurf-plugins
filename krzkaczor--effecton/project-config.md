# effecton agent guide

effecton is a typed effect system for Python inspired by Effect-TS: sync-only, zero runtime dependencies, Python 3.14, strict mypy. Kernel modules live in `packages/effecton/src/effecton/`, std services in `packages/effecton/src/effecton/std/`, and tests in `packages/effecton/tests/`.

## Verification

Verify every change as follows:

- `just fix` is the verification gate: ruff format, then ruff check with fixes, then strict mypy, then pytest. Run it before finishing any change.
- Run everything through `just` or `uv run`, never through bare `python3`.
- Type behavior is pinned in `tests/test_types_*.py` through `assert_type` calls plus deliberate `# type: ignore[code]` negative assertions; `warn_unused_ignores` makes them self-checking.

## Naming and API design

Follow these rules when adding or changing public API:

- **Effect-TS naming parity** for combinators—check Effect-TS for the canonical name (such as `suspend`, `attempt`, and `catch_all`) before inventing one. Diverge only when a better term fits effecton's "requirement" vocabulary; for example, `ImplicitRequirement` instead of Context.Reference, or the overloaded `suspend` decorator instead of Effect.fn.
- **Errors are cause-specific, never generic buckets**: one frozen `EffectonError` dataclass per failure cause, such as `FileNotExists` or `HttpStatusError`. Signatures carry precise unions through `type` aliases. `attempt` error mappers translate only the expected exception types and re-raise the rest so they stay defects.
- **No abstract base classes, ever—always `typing.Protocol`** with `@runtime_checkable`. Implementing classes still explicitly subclass the protocol so that a missing member is a static error.

## Code style

Follow these conventions in all effecton code:

- **Consumer code (tests, README, examples) imports the package once as `import effecton as E`** and accesses everything through it: `E.success`, `E.gen`, `class ParseError(E.EffectonError)`. Don't use flat `from effecton import ...` imports. Library internals import submodules directly (`from effecton.effect import ...`) because `E` is the error TypeVar there.
- **Service pattern**: one module per service, exporting `Protocol`, `Live`, `Test` (with `__test__ = False`), and a `layer`. Consumers alias the module: `from ... import file_system as FileSystem`, then `FileSystem.Protocol`.
- **Use the `@suspend` decorator only where the body does eager work.** A body that only builds an `attempt(...)` doesn't need it, because `attempt` already defers. `suspend` is overloaded: a zero-argument thunk resolves to the deferred effect itself, and a function with parameters resolves to a decorated callable that defers its body per call. `sync` is only for Layer build thunks.
- **Prefer `yield from` over bare `yield`** in `@gen` programs. `Effect.__iter__` types the sent-back value; bare `yield` types as `Any`.
- **Nest helpers inside their only caller**, closing over locals. Reserve module-level private helpers for logic that multiple functions share.
- **mypy limitation**: applying a ParamSpec decorator (`@suspend`, `@gen`) directly to a generic function collapses its type parameters to `Never` under strict mypy. Shape such combinators as an outer typed generic function with an inner zero-argument decorated closure; see `src/effecton/attempt.py`.

## Blank lines

Use blank lines deliberately:

- **Tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert structure** with a single blank line between the three blocks; `tests/std/test_scope.py` is the exemplar.
- **`@gen` generator bodies** put requirement acquisition (`yield from require(...)` or `require_implicit(...)`) at the top, followed by a blank line, then the rest. Never reorder requirement acquisition across guards only for grouping.
- Use exactly one blank line: ruff format collapses runs of two or more and strips blanks that directly follow `def`.
