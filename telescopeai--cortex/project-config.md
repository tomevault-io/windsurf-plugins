# Environment Management

## Environment Files
The project uses different environment files for configuration:

### File Structure
- `local.env`: Development environment settings
- `prod.env`: Production environment settings
- `prod_bck.env`: Backup production settings

### Environment Service
The environment management is handled by `EnvironmentCRUD` service which is integrated with data source management.

### Best Practices:
1. Environment Validation:
- Always validate environment existence before operations
- Use UUID for environment identification
- Check environment constraints before data source operations

2. Environment-Specific Configuration:
- Keep sensitive data in environment files
- Use different configurations for development and production
- Document all environment variables

3. Docker Integration:
- Environment files are used in [docker-compose.yml](mdc:observer/docker-compose.yml)
- Container configurations adapt based on environment
- Use environment-specific volumes and networks

4. Security:
- Never commit sensitive environment values
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Store credentials separately in `credentials/` directory
