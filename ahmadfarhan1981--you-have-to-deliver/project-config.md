Always Use the following guidelines to solve tasks:
1. If you have access to MCP servers. Always use `sequential thinking` to think through the steps required to execute the task.
2. If you don't, try to think off the steps required before executing the tasks. Review the task to make sure they make sense, then only proceed.
3. Verify any assumption by checking the files. Do not continue working based on unverified assumption
4. Test often. Run code incrementally if possible instead of in big chunks.
5. Add test cases related to the change as appropriate.
