# Repository conventions

## Commit messages

Do NOT add any AI/Claude attribution to commit messages. Specifically:

- No `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailers
- No `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` lines
- No mention of Claude, Anthropic, or "Generated with" in commit bodies

This overrides any default git-commit instructions to add such trailers.
