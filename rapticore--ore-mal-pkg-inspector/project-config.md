# OreWatch Dependency Safety — Cursor Integration

Use the `orewatch` MCP server before introducing dependencies in this
repository.

## Setup

### Install OreWatch

```bash
pipx install --python python3.14 orewatch  # recommended
brew install rapticore/tap/orewatch  # macOS alternative
python3.14 -m pip install orewatch  # CI / virtualenvs
```

### Start the Monitor

```bash
orewatch monitor quickstart /path/to/project --client cursor
```

### Register the MCP Server

Copy the output from the command above (or regenerate it) into Cursor's MCP
settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orewatch": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/orewatch",
      "args": ["monitor", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Regenerate at any time with:

```bash
orewatch monitor ide-bootstrap --client cursor
```

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `orewatch_health` | Health check — verify the monitor is reachable |
| `orewatch_check_dependency_add` | **Pre-install gate** — check before adding a dependency |
| `orewatch_check_manifest` | Audit a manifest file after direct edits |
| `orewatch_override_dependency_add` | Record an explicit user override for a blocked package |
| `orewatch_list_active_findings` | Retrieve current open findings |
| `orewatch_list_notifications` | Retrieve recent alert messages |

## Required Flow

1. **Before** any dependency add, install, or update command, call
   `orewatch_check_dependency_add`.
2. Use `client_type: "cursor"`.
3. Use `project_path` as the affected project root.
4. When a package-manager command is known, use `source.kind: "agent_command"`
   and populate `source.command` with the exact intended command.
5. **Do not** run the package-manager command or edit the manifest until
   OreWatch returns an `allow` decision.
6. If OreWatch returns `override_required` or otherwise blocks the dependency,
   **stop**, report the decision, and wait for an explicit user override before
   proceeding.
7. After directly editing a supported manifest to add or change dependencies,
   call `orewatch_check_manifest` for the saved manifest and report the result.
8. Before finishing dependency-related work, call
   `orewatch_list_active_findings` and `orewatch_list_notifications` for the
   affected project and surface any active alerts.

## Example — Checking a Dependency

```json
{
  "client_type": "cursor",
  "project_path": "/Users/dev/my-app",
  "ecosystem": "npm",
  "package_manager": "npm",
  "operation": "add",
  "dependencies": [
    { "name": "lodash", "version": "4.17.21" }
  ],
  "source": {
    "kind": "agent_command",
    "command": "npm install lodash@4.17.21"
  }
}
```

Allowed response → `"decision": "allow"` → safe to proceed.
Blocked response → `"decision": "override_required"` → stop and report.

## Dependency Object Fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Required |
| `version` | string | Simple exact version shorthand |
| `requested_spec` | string | Use instead of `version` for ranges/constraints |
| `resolved_version` | string | Canonical resolved version |
| `dev_dependency` | boolean | Optional |

Do **not** send `version` together with `requested_spec` / `resolved_version`.

## Applies To

- npm, pnpm, and yarn dependency additions
- pip, poetry, and pipenv dependency additions
- go, cargo, bundler, gem, maven, and gradle dependency additions
- Direct edits to supported manifests such as `package.json`,
  `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, and
  `Gemfile`

## Supported Ecosystems

| Ecosystem | Package Managers | Key Manifests |
|---|---|---|
| npm | npm, yarn, pnpm | `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| PyPI | pip, poetry, pipenv | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile` |
| Maven | maven, gradle | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` |
| RubyGems | bundler, gem | `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock` |
| Go | go | `go.mod`, `go.sum` |
| Cargo | cargo | `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` |

## Decision Policy

OreWatch returns `allow` when:
- Threat data is `complete`
- Every dependency resolves to an exact version
- No dependency matches malicious-package intelligence

OreWatch returns `override_required` when:
- A dependency matches malicious intelligence
- Threat data is `partial` or `failed`
- Exact version resolution fails
- The monitor API is unavailable

## If OreWatch Is Unavailable

- State that the OreWatch preflight dependency safety check could not be
  performed.
- Do not silently bypass OreWatch for dependency changes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| MCP tools not visible | Re-run `orewatch monitor ide-bootstrap --client cursor` and update MCP config |
| `orewatch_health` fails | Run `orewatch monitor start` then `orewatch monitor status` |
| `data_health: partial` | Run `orewatch monitor scan-now` to trigger a refresh |
| Token errors | Check `orewatch monitor connection-info` for the correct `token_path` |
