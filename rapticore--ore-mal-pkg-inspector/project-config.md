# OreWatch — Cursor Rules

This repository uses the OreWatch MCP server to enforce supply-chain safety.
Cursor must follow these rules whenever it adds or updates a dependency in any
supported ecosystem.

## MCP Setup

Register OreWatch as an MCP server in Cursor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orewatch": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/orewatch",
      "args": ["monitor", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Generate this block with:

```bash
orewatch monitor ide-bootstrap --client cursor
```

## Dependency Safety Rules

1. Before any dependency add/install/update, call `orewatch_check_dependency_add`
   with `client_type: "cursor"` and the project path, ecosystem, dependencies,
   and intended command.

2. Do NOT run the package-manager command or edit the manifest until OreWatch
   returns `"decision": "allow"`.

3. If OreWatch returns `"decision": "override_required"`, stop and report the
   finding to the user. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding.

4. After directly editing a supported manifest, call `orewatch_check_manifest`.

5. Before finishing dependency work, call `orewatch_list_active_findings` and
   `orewatch_list_notifications` and surface any alerts.

6. If OreWatch is unavailable, state that the safety check could not be
   performed. Never silently bypass it.

## Supported Ecosystems

npm, PyPI, Maven, RubyGems, Go, Cargo

## Available MCP Tools

- `orewatch_health` — health check
- `orewatch_check_dependency_add` — pre-install safety gate
- `orewatch_check_manifest` — manifest audit
- `orewatch_override_dependency_add` — record user override
- `orewatch_list_active_findings` — current open findings
- `orewatch_list_notifications` — recent alerts

## More Details

See `.cursor/rules/orewatch-dependency-checks.mdc` for full tool parameters,
examples, and troubleshooting.
