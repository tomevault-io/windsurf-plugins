# Spike and probe scripts — delete when done

Temporary research scripts (`probe-*.ts`, `spike-*.ts`, scratch runners under `app/scripts/`) exist only to explore save formats, APIs, or data shapes during development.

**Before marking a feature complete, merging, or opening a PR:**

1. **Delete** spike/probe scripts and their scratch outputs (dump JSON, `.tmp`, local-only fixtures) unless the user explicitly asked to keep them.
2. **Promote** durable results into the real codebase:
   - behavior → `app/src/core/` + tests
   - bundled catalog data → `data/`
   - research notes → `docs/findings/`
3. **Do not commit** new spike scripts unless actively mid-investigation on the same branch; if committed, remove them in the same PR before merge.

**Keep** scripts that are part of the product toolchain (`qa-gate.mjs`, `qa-dev.mjs`, documented `npm run` scripts, CI).

When finishing work under `app/`, include spike cleanup in the tbh-qa completion checklist (`.cursor/skills/tbh-qa/SKILL.md`).
