# Git push and PRs — confirm first

**Never push or open a PR without explicit user approval** in the current conversation.

- **`git push`** (including `-u origin …`): summarize branch and commits, then ask. Push only after the user confirms.
- **`gh pr create`** (or equivalent): summarize title, scope, and test plan, then ask. Create the PR only after the user confirms.

Do not treat “work is done” or “branch is ready” as permission to push or open a PR.

Full workflow: `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` and `AGENTS.md` (Conventions).
