# TBH Companion — required skills

Before **implementing** a feature, refactor, or behavior change under `app/`:

1. **Read** (open the file; do not rely on memory):
   - `.cursor/skills/coding-guidelines/SKILL.md` — always
   - `.cursor/skills/tbh-qa/SKILL.md` — completion gate (`npm run qa` incl. lint/format, dev smoke)
2. **Also read when the change touches:**
   - `app/src/renderer/**` → `.cursor/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/skills/tbh-ux/SKILL.md`, and `docs/STYLING.md` (tabs, chrome, overlays, layout)
   - `app/src/main/**`, `app/src/preload/**`, CSP, IPC, network, config → `.cursor/skills/best-practices/SKILL.md`
   - Release, `CHANGELOG.md`, or semver / version bump → `.cursor/skills/tbh-changelog/SKILL.md`

Apply the skills during the work, not only at the end. No drive-by refactors outside the task.

**Layer rules** (with skills): `AGENTS.md` architecture table + `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Refactors:** follow **coding-guidelines** and layer skills; keep diffs surgical — no drive-by rewrites outside the task.

**Done means:** tbh-qa passed (lint, format, typecheck, tests, build), spike/probe scripts removed when applicable, and required skills were followed — not just green tests.
