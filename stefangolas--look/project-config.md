# Agent guide

Machine- and session-specific guidance lives in `AGENTS.local.md`
(untracked). Read it if present; it never overrides the invariants here.

## Product boundary

`look` is a native GLB/STL screenshot executable optimized for time to a usable
image. Keep the hot path small. Do not add browser, GUI, plugin, conversion, or
general scene-framework dependencies unless a measured user requirement needs
them.

## Kernel program law

Kernel code changes only through the packet / worker / `verify.py` loop (see
`loop/ORCHESTRATOR.md`); `vendor/truck/**` is off-limits to direct editing. The
pyo3 binding translation over the stabilized facade is booked and deferred
behind the CG core. The approved kernel design is
`docs/CONSTRUCTIVE_GEOMETRY_PLAN.md`; current program status lives in
`loop/STATE.md` — never in this file.

## Use look efficiently

For one render:

```console
look model.glb --view iso --output render.png --json
```

For one STEP render, use the same flags; the STEP boundary representation is
tessellated on load inside the binary:

```console
look core_xy.step --view iso --output render.png --json
```

For multiple views, prefer one atlas. `--resolution` is per tile:

```console
look model.glb --views front,right,top,iso --atlas 2 --resolution 512x512 --output views.png --json
```

For repeated inspection, persist once and reuse the returned session ID:

```console
look persist model.glb --material-mode source --ttl 600 --json
look render --session SESSION_ID --views front,right,iso --atlas 2 --output views.png --json
look inspect --session SESSION_ID --json
look close SESSION_ID --json
```

Use `technical` material mode when source textures are irrelevant. It skips
texture decode/upload and uses the compact vertex path. Use `source` when PBR
fidelity matters. Use `--preset f3d-match` only for F3D 3.5 compatibility.

Prefer `--json` and parse fields rather than human output. Inspect geometry with
`look inspect MODEL --json`; this command does not initialize the GPU and uses a
validated metadata cache on repeated calls.

## Repository invariants

- CLI name, crate, executable, environment variables, cache paths, and docs use
  `look` consistently.
- CLI flags and YAML fields map to the same normalized configuration types.
- One-shot and session rendering use the same scene compiler and renderer.
- Bounds fitting, named views, traversal, lighting presets, and atlas tile order
  remain deterministic.
- Technical mode must not decode or upload source textures.
- Repeated views must reuse parsed scenes, pipelines, GPU buffers, and targets.
- Unknown YAML fields fail validation.
- Errors returned to agents should remain nonzero and machine-readable where a
  command exposes `--json`.

## Verification

Run before committing:

```console
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --locked --all-targets
cargo test --locked --all-targets
```

On a machine with a native GPU, also run the ignored tests serially because the
session test mutates process cache state:

```console
cargo test --release --test gpu_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

Do not update golden images or performance claims solely to make a test pass.
First explain changes in framing, color, alpha, output dimensions, or adapter.

## Build modes: fast inner loop vs authoritative release

There are two build modes and they answer different questions.

**Fast inner loop** for edit-rebuild-run cycles. Uses the `quick` profile, which
keeps dev semantics/assertions, optimizes at `opt-level = 2`, disables LTO, uses
`codegen-units = 256`, and turns on incremental compilation. Artifacts land in
`target/quick/`, separate from release.

```console
cargo qcheck                      # check --profile quick --locked
cargo qbuild                      # build --profile quick --locked
cargo qtest                       # test --profile quick --tests --locked
cargo test --profile quick --lib <filter> --locked   # narrow kernel test
```

`qtest` uses `--tests`, so it does not compile the `examples/` probe collection
on every dev-test run.

**Authoritative release** for measured performance and regression work. Its
profile (`lto="thin"`, `codegen-units=1`) is fixed; never weaken it.

```console
cargo build --release --locked
```

`target/quick/look.exe` must never be used for recorded performance numbers.
Quick runtime is not comparable to release runtime; the two artifact paths make
a mix-up visible, but only if you keep pointing scripts at `target/release/`.

## Performance work

Benchmark release builds. Retain raw samples and the hardware fingerprint from
`look doctor --json`. Fresh-process and resident-session measurements answer
different questions and must not be combined.

When comparing F3D, include `--no-config`, make camera/resolution/background and
effects explicit, alternate launch order, and compare output fidelity. When
comparing Three.js, verify the resolved WebGL/WebGPU backend and whether adapter
identity is actually observable.

Use physical recorded hardware for published latency claims. Hosted virtual,
partitioned, and software GPUs provide correctness evidence only. See
`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` and `docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_TESTING.md`.
