# Core Rules
- NEVER commit OR push without explicit user permission
- Ask clarifying questions BEFORE making a plan
- ALWAYS make a plan before starting work, and wait for explicit user confirmation

# Branches
- `main` — latest released version
- `develop` — next version in progress; feature branches merge here

# Build
- Solution file: `src/CovertActionTools.sln`
- Build: `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish` from `src/`
- Core targets netstandard2.0 — do not use C# features unavailable in netstandard2.0 when editing Core
- App targets net8.0
- Tests: `dotnet test` from `src/` runs all test projects (xUnit, target net8.0)
- Two test projects: `CovertActionTools.UnitTests.Core` (isolated unit tests with mocks) and `CovertActionTools.IntegrationTests.Core` (real dependencies, roundtrip and snapshot tests)

# Architecture
- Two projects: `CovertActionTools.Core` (library, all data/parsing logic, no GUI dependency) and `CovertActionTools.App` (ImGui + Veldrid desktop GUI, depends on Core)
- Data pipeline pattern: Legacy binary files → `LegacyParser` → `Importer` (JSON package) → `Exporter` (JSON) → `Publisher` (legacy binary). Each data type (Crime, Animation, Text, Image, etc.) has one of each
- All Core services are registered in `Core/ServiceCollectionExtension.cs`. All App ViewModels/Windows are auto-discovered in `App/Program.cs`. New importers/exporters/publishers must be added to `ServiceCollectionExtension`
- Every model implements `Clone()` — when adding new fields to a model, always add them to `Clone()` too

# Domain
- VGA 16-color palette is defined in `Core/Constants.cs`. Color indices 13 (player clothing) and 14 (enemy clothing) are special — replaced dynamically by the game engine at draw time
- Many models contain `Unknown*` fields (e.g. `Unknown1`, `Unknown2`). These are partially reverse-engineered from the binary format. Do not rename, remove, or repurpose them

# Testing Principles
- Organise tests by domain area in folders (e.g. `Compression/`, `Parsers/`), with each area having its own test data generator helper
- Each test data generator should be named for its area (e.g. `LzwTestDataGenerator`, `SharedImageTestDataGenerator`) — no generic `TestDataGenerator`
- Test data generators, snapshot data, and snapshot generators live in a `Data/` subfolder within each area (e.g. `Parsers/Data/`, `Compression/Data/`)
- Test stubs and mocks live in a `Stubs/` subfolder within each area (e.g. `Parsers/Stubs/`)
- **Unit tests** (`UnitTests.Core`): mock dependencies (e.g. `ILzwDecompression`), use hand-crafted byte arrays for inputs, test the class in isolation
- **Integration tests** (`IntegrationTests.Core`): use real dependencies, no mocks. Two styles:
  - *Roundtrip*: use the Exporter to generate binary data, then parse it back with the Parser and verify the output matches the original input
  - *Snapshot*: capture known-good outputs as base64 constants in a helper class, assert against them for regression detection
- Both test projects access Core internals via `InternalsVisibleTo` — keep Core .csproj updated when adding new test projects

# Scratch Folder
- Keep all temporary and transient files (e.g. TASKS.md, investigation notes, scratch scripts) in the `scratch/` subfolder at the repo root
- The `scratch/` folder is gitignored (except `.gitkeep`) — nothing in it will be committed

# Code Style
- Prefer making classes `internal` unless they are consumed outside Core. Test projects get access via `InternalsVisibleTo`
- Use `#region Name` / `#endregion` to group related code sections — not `// --- Name ---` comments
- Do not use `<Using>` in .csproj files — add `using` directives explicitly in each source file
