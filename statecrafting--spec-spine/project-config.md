# AGENTS.md: spec-spine

## New Sessions

Run `/init` as the mandatory first action of every new session. The command reads this section to derive its execution plan dynamically: any item added here is automatically picked up on the next init. This file is the cross-agent authority (read by Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Copilot, and any future agent via the AAIF/Linux Foundation AGENTS.md standard).

**Init protocol (executed by `/init`):**

> AGENTS.md is loaded implicitly as the protocol source: its contents
> are the protocol, so `/init` does not list AGENTS.md as a parallel
> identity read in Step 1 (avoiding the self-reference loop).

The protocol drives the library through its own built binary, `target/release/spec-spine` (dogfooding). If that binary is missing, build it first: `cargo build --release -p spec-spine-cli`. Do NOT reach for `npx spec-spine` here; the npm/py distributions are for adopters, the self-governance loop uses the in-tree binary.

0. **Load rules.** Read `.claude/rules/orchestrator-rules.md`,
   `.claude/rules/governed-artifact-reads.md`, AND
   `.claude/rules/adversarial-prompt-refusal.md` (the three the library
   scaffolds for every adopter via `spec-spine init`, and which it
   carries for itself).
1. **Refresh the registry, then parallel reads.** Run `spec-spine
   compile` *first* (see **Registry freshness** below), then dispatch the
   following simultaneously:
   - `CLAUDE.md`: project overview and conventions
   - `README.md`: full project description
   - `standards/spec/contract.md`: normative spec-system summary
   - `standards/spec/constitution.md`: durable principles (tier 2)
   - `spec-spine index check`: staleness gate for the codebase index (non-fatal)
   - `spec-spine index render`: markdown projection of the committed index
   - `spec-spine registry status-report --json --nonzero-only`: lifecycle counts per status
   - `spec-spine registry list --ids-only`: spec id list (for latest-spec detection)
   - `ls crates/`: library crate layout
   - `ls specs/`: the spec corpus
   - `ls docs/`: docs surface (design notes, governance)
   - `git log --oneline -10`: recent history
   - `git diff --stat HEAD~1`: last change summary
2. **Emit** the `## initialized: spec-spine` summary block: a layer/crate
   overview, a `## lifecycle:` sub-section populated from the
   `registry status-report --nonzero-only` output, recent activity, and a
   "ready to help with" line.

**Read discipline:** the init protocol MUST NOT parse `.derived/**/*.json` directly (no `python`, `jq`, `awk`, `sed` against compiled artifacts). All structural and lifecycle data comes from the `spec-spine` subcommands (`registry`, `index`) and the rendered markdown view. See `.claude/rules/governed-artifact-reads.md`.

**Staleness surface:** if `spec-spine index check` exits non-zero, include "Codebase index: stale, run `spec-spine index`" in the summary and continue. If the index is not built and `render` fails, report "Codebase index: not built" and continue without structural counts.

**Registry freshness:** spec-spine **commits** its compiled artifacts. Since spec 024 both views are committed as per-unit shard trees: `.derived/spec-registry/by-spec/<id>.json` and `.derived/codebase-index/{by-spec,by-package}/*.json` are tracked (only `.derived/**/build-meta.json` is gitignored; no monolithic `registry.json`/`index.json` is committed). The committed shard set is the reference for lifecycle queries. `/init` still runs `spec-spine compile` *first* because compile is deterministic: on a fresh tree it is a no-op that leaves the tracked shards byte-identical, so it costs nothing; but if it changes a shard, the committed copy was stale and the refreshed counts are the correct ones (regenerate and commit the shards before relying on them). Either way the lifecycle counts reflect the current `specs/*/spec.md` frontmatter.

**Binary missing:** if the `spec-spine` binary is not built, run `cargo build --release -p spec-spine-cli` and continue. Do NOT fall back to ad-hoc parsing of `.derived/**`.

If any file is missing: log "not found" and continue.

## Available Agents

Agents live in `.claude/agents/`. Four pipeline agents handle the plan/explore/implement/review cycle:

- `architect`: plans and decomposes tasks, validates approaches against specs. Read-only.
- `explorer`: searches the codebase, traces dependencies, gathers context. Read-only.
- `implementer`: executes focused code changes from an existing plan. Produces minimal diffs.
- `reviewer`: post-change review for bugs, correctness, and spec compliance. Read-only.

## Available Commands

Commands live in `.claude/skills/` (one `SKILL.md` per folder):

- `/init`: initialize a session (load context, lifecycle, recent activity)
- `/setup`: one-time contributor setup, build the `spec-spine` binary and verify the compile then index then lint then couple loop works
- `/commit`: create a git commit with an impact-focused conventional message
