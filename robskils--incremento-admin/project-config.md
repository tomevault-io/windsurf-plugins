# Incremento Admin Dashboard

Admin panel for incremento.co enquiry management — pipeline, contacts, analytics.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS in `public/` — deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Worker at `enquiries.incremento.co`
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (`incremento-admin`)
- **Email:** Resend API
- **Auth:** Built-in email OTP login (6-digit code via Resend → 7-day HS256 JWT signed with ADMIN_KEY, sent as `Authorization: Bearer`). Allowed emails in `ADMIN_EMAILS` var in wrangler.toml. Legacy `X-Admin-Key` header still accepted. Auth endpoints: `POST /auth/request-code`, `POST /auth/verify`. OTP codes in D1 `otp_codes` table (10-min expiry). Admin API also routed same-origin at `admin.incremento.co/api/*`.

## Design System
- Background: `#0e1820` (dark midnight)
- Accent lime: `#9EF54A`, Accent cyan: `#5EE7D8`
- Fonts: Space Grotesk (headings) + Inter (body)
- Shared stylesheet: `public/admin.css`
- Shared JS: `public/admin.js`

## Pages
```
public/
  index.html      → redirect to dashboard
  dashboard.html  → KPIs, pipeline funnel, won revenue, service breakdown, monthly chart (analytics merged in)
  triage.html     → smart triage queue: pending inbound submissions, each with a suggested match (email>company>domain). Actions: new deal / merge into existing / not-a-deal (dismiss)
  inbox.html      → (hidden from nav; still reachable by URL)
  enquiry.html    → full-page enquiry view/edit (?id=N)
  pipeline.html   → stage view + quick stage update
  proposals.html  → proposals HUB: overview stats + tabs (Proposals list · Proposal Structure · Components · Email template · Branding). Proposal Structure = ordered sections of a proposal doc, each with editable shared_content (feeds every proposal) + guidance; add/remove/reorder; a section can't be deleted while components are attached (warns). Components (formerly "Component Library") now each carry a section_id mapping them into a structure section.
  proposal.html   → full-page proposal editor (?id=N edit, ?enquiry=N AI-draft, blank=new)
  contacts.html   → deduplicated contact list
  settings.html   → admin key, editable proposal email template, quick links
  brand.html      → brand assets: logos (light/dark previews + SVG/PNG download), colour swatches (click-copy), guidelines
  brand/          → logo + favicon source files + incremento-brand-pack.zip
  admin.css       → shared dark theme stylesheet
  admin.js        → shared JS (auth, API helpers, utilities)
  favicon.svg     → Incremento icon
```

## Pipeline Stages
`new` → `meeting_booked` (labelled "Call Booked") → `call_complete` ("Call Complete") → `proposal_sent` → `accepted` → `in_progress` → `on_hold` → `completed` ("Complete") / `cancelled`
(Canonical labels/colours/order live in STAGE_LABELS/STAGE_CSS/STAGE_COLORS in admin.js, mirrored in pipeline.html arrays + enquiry.html `<select>`. NB the `meeting_booked` KEY is retained — only its label changed to "Call Booked" — so existing rows didn't need migrating. `completed` is still the won-revenue key.)

## Worker API (all require X-Admin-Key header)
- `POST /`                  → form submission (no auth required, public)
- `GET /api/enquiries`      → list all (supports ?limit=&offset=&stage=)
- `GET /api/enquiries/:id`  → single enquiry
- `PATCH /api/enquiries/:id`→ update stage/notes/value/project_title/company/company_url
- `DELETE /api/enquiries/:id`→ delete a deal + cascade (contacts, deal_assignees, messages, proposals via enquiry_id). UI: trash button per pipeline row + "Delete deal" button on enquiry.html
- `GET /api/stats`          → dashboard KPIs (total, new_count, stage_counts, potential_revenue)
- `POST /api/proposals/draft` → AI-draft proposal from enquiry (body: {enquiry_id, components?[]}; needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret). New flow: `proposal.html?enquiry=N` shows a **scoping step** first — Robin picks library components in the picker ('draft' mode), then Claude assembles the proposal AROUND them (each component → tailored scope workstream + pricing line); "draft from enquiry alone" skips the picker. System prompt enforces no-em-dash.
- `GET/POST /api/proposals` (`?archived=1` lists archived; default excludes them) + `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/proposals/:id` → proposal CRUD. **Archive** is soft (column `archived` 0/1 on proposals, set via PATCH {archived}); **Delete** is hard (cascade). Both surfaced on proposals.html rows (+ "Show archived" toggle with Restore) and on the proposal.html editor header.
- `POST /api/proposals/:id/send` → email proposal link to client via Resend
- `GET /p/:token` (public) → branded proposal page (records view). `?preview=1` = admin preview (works for drafts, banner, hides Accept, no view recorded). `?pdf=1` = auto-download. Download PDF button uses html2pdf to keep the dark theme; @media print also preserves dark colors.
- `POST /p/:token/accept` (public) → client accepts; emails Robin; enquiry stage → accepted; logs inbound message
- `GET /api/companies` → distinct company names (+ representative company_url) for the deal company picker
