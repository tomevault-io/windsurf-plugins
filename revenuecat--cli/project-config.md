The canonical agent guide for this repository is [AGENTS.md](mdc:AGENTS.md).
Read it before making changes. It covers:

- The two-layer rule: `internal/api/` is REST-shaped; `internal/cli/` is
  user-intent-shaped. Never let CLI concepts leak into `api/`, and never let
  HTTP concepts leak into `cli/`.
- Dual-mode contract: every command must work for humans (TTY, prompts, pretty
  output) and agents (`--json`, `--no-input`, `--yes`, stable exit codes).
- Every interactive prompt must also be a flag and an env var.
- Don't auto-generate from the OpenAPI spec. This is a hand-crafted CLI.
- Don't name commands after HTTP verbs/paths. Name them after user intent.
- stdout = data, stderr = chatter. `--json` never auto-activates from pipe
  detection.

When in doubt about where code belongs, re-read AGENTS.md's "Where things
live" table.
