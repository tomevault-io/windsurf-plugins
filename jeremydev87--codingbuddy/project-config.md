# codingbuddy Agent System

## Required: Mode Keyword Detection

When user message starts with `PLAN`, `ACT`, `EVAL`, `AUTO` (or localized variants: 자동, 自動, 自动, AUTOMÁTICO):

→ **Immediately** call `parse_mode` MCP tool

## File Context → Agent Mapping

| File Pattern | Recommended Agent | MCP Call |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| `*.tsx`, `*.ts` | frontend-developer | `get_agent_details("frontend-developer")` |
| `*.go`, `*.py`, `*.java`, `*.rs` | backend-developer | `get_agent_details("backend-developer")` |
| `Dockerfile`, `*.yml` | devops-engineer | `get_agent_details("devops-engineer")` |
| `*.json` (agents/) | agent-architect | `get_agent_details("agent-architect")` |

## Specialist Auto-Recommendation

| Detected Topic | Recommended Specialist |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Security, auth, XSS, CSRF | security-specialist |
| Accessibility, ARIA, a11y, WCAG | accessibility-specialist |
| Performance, bundle, optimization | performance-specialist |
| Testing, TDD, coverage | test-strategy-specialist |
| Architecture, layers, dependencies | architecture-specialist |

## Pre-Analysis

Before starting specialist analysis, optionally call `analyze_task` MCP tool for:
- Risk assessment of the current task
- Recommended specialists (may differ from file-pattern defaults)
- Contextual checklists

## Specialist Execution Pattern

When `parse_mode` returns `parallelAgentsRecommendation`:

1. Call `prepare_parallel_agents` MCP tool with the recommended specialists
2. Execute each specialist **sequentially** (one at a time):
   - Announce: "🔍 Analyzing from [icon] [specialist-name] perspective..."
   - Apply specialist system prompt to analyze target code
   - Record findings
3. Present consolidated findings summary

See `packages/rules/.ai-rules/adapters/cursor.md` for full details.
