# codingbuddy Rules

## Workflow

- **PLAN** → **ACT** → **PLAN** (default flow)
- **EVAL** only on explicit request
- **AUTO** for autonomous PLAN → ACT → EVAL cycle until quality achieved

## Required Actions

When `PLAN`, `ACT`, `EVAL`, `AUTO` keywords detected → **Immediately** call `parse_mode` MCP tool

## Context Persistence

After completing work in any mode → call `update_context` MCP tool to persist decisions and notes.

## Quality Tools

- `analyze_task` — Pre-planning task analysis with risk assessment
- `generate_checklist` — Contextual checklists for security, accessibility, performance
- `search_rules` — Search project rules and guidelines
- `get_code_conventions` — Get code conventions and style guide

## Core Principles

- TDD: Red → Green → Refactor
- Test coverage 90%+
- TypeScript strict (no `any`)
- Server Components first

## Project Config

Use `get_project_config` MCP tool to retrieve project-specific settings (language, tech stack, conventions).

## Skills

When a skill might apply to the user's task:
1. Call `recommend_skills` with the user's prompt
2. If recommendations returned, call `get_skill` with the top skillName
3. Follow the loaded skill instructions

Key skill triggers:
- Bug/error/debug → `systematic-debugging`
- New feature/build → `brainstorming` → `writing-plans`
- TDD/test → `test-driven-development`
- Plan execution → `executing-plans`
