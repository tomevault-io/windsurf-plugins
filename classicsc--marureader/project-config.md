# Agent instructions for MaruReader

## Project Overview

MaruReader is a Japanese language learning tool for iOS/iPadOS with an ebook reader, manga reader, and web browser that integrate with a dictionary system.

## Building

MaruReader uses synchronized filesystem groups. Routine addition and removal of source code files does not require editing the project file.

Build and test commands are provided by `just`. Use it instead of invoking the `xcodebuild` CLI directly for routine build and test runs, they provide logging conveniences and don't spam stdout. Xcode function calls can be used instead if available in your environment. If you change UI strings, you should run a build through the xcode function call to trigger a localization string catalog sync, then update translations as part of your patch.

Run builds and tests unsandboxed if your environment has sandboxing. Tests can take upwards of 3 minutes (sometimes over 5 minutes for a brand new simulator) so set timeouts/waits accordingly. Do not interrupt builds. Checking or tailing the build logs during an in-progress build is not recommended.

```bash
Available recipes:
    build configuration="Debug" destination=""   # builds the project, optionally specify a build configuration and destination
    default                                      # list the available recipes
    format                                       # runs swiftformat on the entire project
    licenses                                     # syncs bundled third-party license documents and catalog
    licenses-refresh                             # refreshes upstream license snapshots, including Rust cargo-about output, before syncing bundled third-party licenses
    prerelease                                   # creates a prerelease archive by incrementing the build number, then commits and tags it
    release version                              # creates a release archive by setting the marketing version, resetting build to 1, then commits and tags it
    release-status                               # shows the synced marketing version and build number for MaruReader and its release extensions
    screenshots                                  # runs the UI screenshot test plan and extracts images to build/screenshots/
    starterdict                                  # builds the initial database with Jitendex and Kanji Alive
    sudachi-bindings                             # regenerates committed UniFFI Swift bindings for MaruSudachiFFI
    test destination=""                          # runs all test plans, optionally specify a destination
    test-one only_testing plan="" destination="" # runs the only_testing test/suite in the given plan, optionally specify destination
    test-plan plan destination=""                # runs a specific test plan, optionally specify a destination
```

Available test plans:

```text
MaruReaderTests
MaruReaderCoreTests
MaruAnkiTests
MaruDictionaryManagementTests
MaruMangaTests
MaruReaderUITests
MaruTextAnalysisTests
MaruWebTests
```

Do not run `just` recipes (or xcodebuild commands) in parallel, each invocation needs a lock on the build folder. Bypassing this limitation by adding another DerivedData folder is not allowed as this could exhaust system RAM and lock up the build.

Example:

```bash
just build # Simple build of the MaruReader target
just test-plan MaruReaderCoreTests # Run when MaruReaderCore is involved in changes
just test-one MaruReaderTests/AnkiSettingsSnapshotTests MaruReaderTests # If avoiding other MaruReaderTests suites is required
```

`just test-plan` is nearly always the recipe to use for tests. `just test-one` is generally not a "lighter" recipe. It is for situations where you must avoid executing other tests in the plan. The one time it can be lighter is if you're running tests from MaruReaderUITests. All methods of testing with xcodebuild will resolve the package graph, build MaruReader.app, and go through simulator workflows taking minutes before executing the test plan (usually under 20s).
