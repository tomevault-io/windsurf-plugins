# Idun Agent Engine

Read `libs/idun_agent_engine/CLAUDE.md` before making changes. It contains the full module map, config flow, agent adapter details, and conventions.

- All agent operations are async (`initialize`, `invoke`, `stream`).
- LangGraph expects an **uncompiled StateGraph** — the engine compiles it with checkpointer/store.
- Observability config is top-level, not inside `agent.config` (agent-level is deprecated).
- Dynamic imports for agent loading: file path first, Python module fallback.
- Schema models come from `idun_agent_schema` — don't duplicate them here.
