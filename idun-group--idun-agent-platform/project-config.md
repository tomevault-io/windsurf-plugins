# Idun Agent Platform

This is a monorepo. Each package/service has its own `CLAUDE.md` with detailed architecture, module maps, and conventions. **Always read the relevant CLAUDE.md before working on a specific package.**

## Documentation Map

- `CLAUDE.md` — Root: project overview, build commands, testing, linting, development principles
- `libs/idun_agent_schema/CLAUDE.md` — Schema library: Pydantic models, config hierarchy, discriminated unions, manager CRUD schemas
- `libs/idun_agent_engine/CLAUDE.md` — Engine SDK: agent adapters, config flow, YAML structure, server endpoints, guardrails, observability, MCP, CLI
- `services/idun_agent_manager/CLAUDE.md` — Manager API: routes, authentication, multi-tenancy, database models, migrations, settings
- `services/idun_agent_web/CLAUDE.md` — Web UI: routes, auth flow, API layer, styling, i18n, state management

## Key Rules

- Read before you write. Understand existing patterns before modifying.
- Schema changes go in `idun_agent_schema` first, then propagate to engine and manager.
- Python: async throughout, Ruff + Black formatting, line length 88.
- Run `make lint` and `make precommit` before committing.
- No `Any` types unless genuinely unavoidable.
- Don't mix refactoring with feature work in the same change.
- Small, focused commits — one concern per commit.
