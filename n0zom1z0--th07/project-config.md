# TH07 reconstruction agent rules

This repository reconstructs one exact binary: the original Japanese TH07
version 1.00b executable whose identity is recorded in `config/target.toml`.
Do not analyze or substitute a localized, patched, or earlier executable.

## Before changing reconstruction state

1. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/RE_WORKFLOW.md`, and the relevant module
   notes.
2. Run `python3 scripts/verify-target.py` and
   `python3 scripts/check-ida-mcp.py`.
3. Inspect `config/functions.csv` and `config/claims.csv`; claim a small,
   address-bounded unit before implementation.
4. Reconcile IDA's function extent with target instructions and the ledger.
   IDA chunks and decompiler output are useful evidence, not accepted boundaries.

## Evidence and status rules

- Keep target observations, adjacent-version inferences, and unknowns distinct.
- TH06/TH08 names and source are supporting evidence only. Confirm every name,
  ABI, field offset, side effect, and boundary against TH07.
- Never mechanically paste decompiler output as source.
- Never add fake-return or empty behavioral bodies merely to make a build link.
- Never use a naked function, whole-function inline assembly, or a
  target-instruction transcription as a substitute for reconstructed source.
  A function may be marked `matching` only when its real C/C++ implementation
  is independently derived from target evidence and strictly compared. Inline
  assembly is allowed only for a narrowly evidenced ABI boundary within an
  otherwise real implementation; it must not encode the function's control
  flow, field accesses, or behavior merely to force a byte match.
- `config/functions.csv` is the source of truth. Use the lifecycle
  `unclassified`, `identified`, `decompiled`, `implemented`, `compiles`,
  `matching`, `library`, or `blocked`.
- `matching` requires `match_percent=100.00` and a reproducible comparison
  command/report in `evidence`. Visual similarity and normalized clone hashes
  cannot grant matching status.

## Analysis database safety

IDA MCP is attached to the file currently open in the GUI and has no program
selector. Re-run the exact metadata preflight for every bounded work unit.
Never call `patch_address_assembles` or otherwise patch target bytes. Preserve
durable discoveries in tracked CSV, source, or documentation rather than only
inside an IDB.

## ABI and implementation

- Preserve the VC7 x86 ABI: calling conventions, field widths, object layout,
  vtable order, exception behavior, static initialization, and translation-unit
  boundaries.
- Build and compare the smallest affected function or object first.
- Keep generated reports below `build/` and local analysis below `.analysis/`.
- Do not commit original executables, game data, IDA databases, toolchains,
  third-party reference clones, generated reports, or credentials.

## Parallel reconstruction

For two or more concurrent lanes, read `.agents/skills/th07-parallel/SKILL.md`
together with `.agents/skills/th07-re/SKILL.md`. For compiler shaping, also
read `.agents/skills/th07-matching/SKILL.md`.

- The coordinator owns IDA writes, shared ABI/type decisions, address claims,
  the function ledger, generated progress, Git commits, and pushes.
- Evidence/matching workers receive non-overlapping address ranges and source
  files. They must not rename or retype unrelated functions in IDA.
- A worker starts from a coordinator-prepared target packet and canonical
  `config/match-units.toml` entry, then iterates only through
  `python3 scripts/build.py --unit NAME --compare --json`.
- Shared headers, class layouts, compiler profiles, relocation allowlists, and
  translation-unit partitions require coordinator review before mutation.
- The typed-RE automation (`scripts/typed-re.py`, `scripts/typed_re/`,
  `scripts/scan-vc7-library.py`, `config/typed-re-rules.toml`, and its skill)
  is coordinator-owned. Workers may execute it and submit feedback or proposed
  rules, but must not modify it.
- Worker reports are proposals. The coordinator reruns the strict comparison,
  updates status/evidence, releases claims, and performs all Git integration.

## Handoff

Run `python3 scripts/validate-tracking.py`, `python3 scripts/build.py --check`,
`python3 scripts/progress.py --check`, and `git diff --check`. Report addresses,
evidence, old/new status, exact comparison result, and remaining uncertainty.
