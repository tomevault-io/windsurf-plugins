# AGENTS.md

Rules that must not be violated when working in this repository. For architecture and feature details, read the code. Subsystem conventions and invariants live in the `repo-conventions` skill (`.agents/skills/repo-conventions/SKILL.md`) — load it when working on the reader, sync/offline, dashboard, detail pages, or platform UI placement.

## Project

**KMReader** is a native SwiftUI client for [Komga](https://github.com/gotson/komga). iOS 17+ / macOS 14+ / tvOS 17+, Swift 6, Xcode 15+. There are no XCTest targets: validate with builds and manual testing.

## Commands

All builds run through the Makefile (wrapping `misc/xcode.py`); never invoke `xcodebuild` directly.

```bash
make build          # build all platforms (preferred validation)
make build-ios      # platform-specific; run sequentially, never in parallel
make build-macos    #   (xcodebuild shares one DerivedData database)
make build-tvos
make run-ios-sim / make run-macos / make run-tvos-sim   # run (device choice persisted in devices.json)
make format         # format code after editing
make localize       # update localizations; ./misc/translate.py list|update for keys
make bump / make minor / make major   # version management
```

Never edit `MARKETING_VERSION` or `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.pbxproj` by hand. Run `make bump` only when the user explicitly asks; the bump commit then rides along in the feature/fix PR, not a separate PR.

After changing code: `make format`, then `make build`. Simulator interaction: verified multi-step UI sequences go through the `jevsim_*` MCP tools; observation, gestures, and logs go through `baguette` (see the `simulator` skill): filter logs with subsystem `com.everpcpc.kmreader` (categories `API`, `SSE`, `ReaderViewModel`).

## Coding Conventions

1. **Comments**: minimal, English only; no issue/PR numbers (link issues in the PR description instead).
2. **Git-facing text**: commit messages, PR titles/bodies, and review comments are always in English.
3. **UI frameworks**: SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit are all acceptable; pick per feature and platform.
4. **No inline `Binding`**.
5. **No `confirmationDialog`**.
6. **One type per file**.
7. **State**: `@Observable`, never `ObservableObject`.
8. **Preferences**: `@AppStorage` in views, `AppConfig` elsewhere; `UserDefaults` only inside `AppConfig.swift`.
9. No stored variables in view bodies; avoid computed-property clutter there too.
10. In-reader settings sheets stay compact; full settings pages may carry description text.
11. Platform differences via `PlatformHelper` and `#if os(...)`.
12. UIKit/AppKit interop in either direction is fine; be explicit about dependency injection and verify environment/data propagation across hosting boundaries.
13. **Banned**: non-optional object-style environment dependencies (`@Environment(SomeType.self)`, `@EnvironmentObject`). Pass objects via initializers, context structs, or action closures; use non-object custom `EnvironmentKey`s when needed.
14. **Banned**: `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)`, `unsafeBitCast`, other `unsafe*` escape hatches. Redesign instead.
15. Do not store async/throwing/`@Sendable` closures in SwiftUI `View` value types (iOS 17 AttributeGraph crash risk); use concrete command types or passed-in services.
16. **Animation boundaries**: local implicit `.animation(..., value:)` only for micro-interactions (press/hover/selected states); explicit `withAnimation {}` for navigation, presentation, content, and pagination changes. No broad/root `.animation` on containers rendering lists.
17. No patch-style fixes for structural problems; no compensating flags/delays/counters around a broken ownership boundary. Refactor toward the stable architecture.
18. End-state quality beats diff size; do not fear rewriting a subsystem when that is the cleaner design.
19. Temporary compatibility layers must say why they exist and what replaces them; treat them as debt.
20. When a change alters a lifetime, ownership, persistence, navigation, platform, reader-mode, or UI-placement boundary, update the conventions in the same change: `AGENTS.md` for repo-wide rules, the `repo-conventions` skill for subsystem boundaries.
21. No hand-rolled fallback shims for newer OS APIs; gate features to the OS version that supports them natively.
22. **No force casts** (`as!`), especially on GRDB `Row` subscripts; use the generic converting subscript (`let date: Date = row["created_date"]`) or `as?` with a fallback.
23. Never render an empty `HStack`/`VStack`; put the condition around the stack itself so nothing renders when there is no content.
24. Lazy containers (`LazyVStack`/`LazyHStack`/`LazyVGrid`) only for genuinely unbounded content (paginated or otherwise huge lists); eager stacks everywhere else — lazy stacks cache child frames and misplace children during animated layout updates.
