# ORIAnnotations — LLM Session Guide

This document gives a future AI agent session the context needed to work on this codebase without re-deriving everything from scratch.

---

## What this project is

A toolkit for sharing review annotations between applications in real time. The primary integration is OpenRV, with an xStudio plugin also present. A web-based debug viewer (`sync_viewer`) can join any live session as a passive observer.

The core protocol is built on top of **OpenTimelineIO (OTIO)**: the shared state is an OTIO `Timeline`, mutations are broadcast as structured JSON messages over **RabbitMQ**, and every peer maintains a local replica of that timeline.

For a detailed breakdown of the protocol and architecture, see [docs/architecture.md](file:///Users/sam/git/ORIAnnotations/docs/architecture.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `python/otio_sync_core/` | Network-agnostic sync library. The thing all peers use. |
| `python/otio_sync_core/manager.py` | `SyncManager` — master-election, timeline mutations, annotation persistence. |
| `python/otio_sync_core/rabbitmq_network.py` | RabbitMQ fanout-exchange backend (uses `pika`). |
| `python/otio_sync_core/proxy.py` | `OTIOSyncProxy` — transparent attribute-write interceptor for OTIO objects. |
| `rvplugin/ori_sync/plugin.py` | OpenRV sync plugin. Builds OTIO timelines from RV sessions, broadcasts playback & annotations. |
| `rvplugin/ori_sync/makepackage.csh` | Build script that produces the `.rvpkg` installable. |
| `rvplugin/ori_annotations/` | Legacy OpenRV plugin for exporting/importing annotations as custom OTIO files. |
| `sync_viewer/server.py` | FastAPI + WebSocket debug viewer server. Joins the session as a passive peer. |
| `sync_viewer/static/index.html` | Single-file browser UI for the debug viewer. |
| `xstudio_plugin/` | xStudio equivalent of the RV plugin (separate integration). |
| `otio_event_plugin/` | OTIO schemadef plugin that defines `SyncEvent` — used to embed annotation commands in OTIO metadata. |
| `openspec/` | Protocol specification documents. |

## Important Technical Documentation

Before modifying specific components, **you MUST read the corresponding constraints document**. The codebase has numerous non-obvious gotchas regarding threading, event loops, and coordinate systems.

- **OpenRV Plugin**: [docs/openrv_constraints.md](docs/openrv_constraints.md)
- **xStudio Plugin**: [docs/xstudio_constraints.md](docs/xstudio_constraints.md)
- **Sync Viewer**: [docs/sync_viewer_constraints.md](docs/sync_viewer_constraints.md)
- **Debugging & Diagnostics**: [debug/README.md](debug/README.md)

---

## Python coding style

All Python uses **Sphinx reStructuredText docstrings** (docs built with `make html` in `docs/`). See `python/otio_sync_core/manager.py` for examples. Key rules:

- `:param name:`, `:returns:`, `:rtype:`, `:raises ExcType:` fields in every public function/method.
- Class docstrings document `__init__` params; don't repeat them on `__init__` itself.
- Cross-reference OTIO types as `:class:`~opentimelineio.schema.Timeline``.
- No docstrings on private helpers (`_foo`) unless the logic is non-obvious.
- Inline comments explain *why*, not *what*.

---

## Dependencies

Runtime: `opentimelineio`, `pika` (RabbitMQ client, vendored into `.rvpkg`), `fastapi` + `uvicorn` (sync_viewer only). Requires a RabbitMQ broker at `localhost:5672` (no auth needed for local use).

# AI Agents

This project utilizes AI agents to assist with the development workflow. Below are the defined roles and their responsibilities.

## 🤖 Antigravity (The Main Assistant)
**Role**: Lead Developer / Pair Programmer
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyzing codebase and understanding requirements.
- Planning and implementing features and bug fixes.
- Writing code, tests, and documentation.
- Conducting code reviews and refactoring.
- Managing project structure and configuration.

## 🧠 OpenSpec Agents (Spec-Driven Development)
Where applicable, agents may be specialized for OpenSpec workflows:

### Architect
- **Focus**: High-level design and system architecture.
- **Tasks**: Drafting specifications, defining interfaces, validating requirements.

### Implementer
- **Focus**: Writing code based on specifications.
- **Tasks**: Translating specs into implementation, adhering to coding standards.

### Verifier / QA
- **Focus**: Validation and testing.
- **Tasks**: Creating test plans, writing unit/integration tests, verifying implementation against specs.
- **Tools**: Unit tests (pytest), UI Tests (QtQuick.Test).

## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure
- **Unit Tests**: `test/` (C++), `src/plugin/.../test_*.py` (Python)
- **UI / Integration Tests**: `sync_test/` (Python framework driving OpenRV and xStudio)
- **RPA Helpers**: `rpa_test/`

## 📝 Documentation Agent
- **Focus**: Knowledge management.
- **Tasks**: Maintaining documentation, creating tutorials, updating KIs (Knowledge Items).

## usage
To interact with a specific agent persona, you can address them by role or context in your prompt, e.g., "As an Architect, how should we structure this module?".
