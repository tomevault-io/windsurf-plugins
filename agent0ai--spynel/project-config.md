# TUI Fixture DOX

## Purpose

- Own deterministic checked-in fixture data used by TUI visual and composer capture tests.

## Local Contracts

- Update fixtures only with the behavior or layout they verify, keep data synthetic and free of local paths or private history, and review diffs as test expectations rather than generated noise.
- `composer-transcript.json` must remain deterministic across hosts and synchronized with its consuming tests and capture script.

## Child DOX Index

No child DOX files.
