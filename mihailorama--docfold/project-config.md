# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure
- `docfold/` - main package source
- `tests/` - pytest tests mirroring package structure
- `docs/` - documentation and conventions

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pip install -e ".[dev]"` - install with dev dependencies
- `pytest tests/` - run all tests
- `pytest tests/ -m "not slow"` - skip slow integration tests

## Coding Style
- PEP 8, 4-space indentation, type hints on public API
- Use `loguru.logger` for logging
- Async functions with `async def` for I/O operations

## Feature Development Workflow (TDD - MANDATORY)

This repository enforces Test-Driven Development. Every feature or fix MUST follow this sequence:

### Step 1: Proposal
Create `docs/tasks/FEATURE_NAME.md` using the template at `docs/tasks/_TEMPLATE.md`.
Define: problem, solution, affected files, test plan, edge cases.

### Step 2: Failing Tests (Red Phase)
Write tests in `tests/` using pytest.
Run `pytest tests/` - new tests MUST fail (no implementation yet).
If tests pass without implementation, they are testing nothing useful.

### Step 3: Implementation (Green Phase)
Implement code to make failing tests pass. Run tests after every change.
Stop when all tests are green.

### Step 4: E2E Verification
Test with real documents. Verify backward compatibility.

### Anti-patterns
- Writing implementation before tests
- Writing tests that pass immediately (they test nothing)
- Skipping the proposal step for non-trivial features
- Merging without green tests
