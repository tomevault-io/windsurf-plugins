# Instructions for the Astronomical Project

- This is our constitution at repo-root/docs/north-star-product-vision.md everything is derived from there.
- You keep repo-root/docs/performance-optimizations-lessons.md updated with lessons learnt about performance relevant to LLMs, VLMs and MLX APIs.
- The user is ALWAYS looking for you to **proactively** suggest how to reduce over engineering and reduce code complexity.
- All commands and tests must emit a live progress indicator instead of leaving the user with silent output.
- NEVER pipe long-running commands through | tail -30, | head, or any filter that buffers output and hides live progress from the user. The user must be able to observe progress as it happens.
- All and any tests must have a built in timeout with a maximum of 120 seconds.
- Astronomical is expected to adapt to any laptop, any RAM size, any GPU wired memory limit. Do not hardwire or optimize the codebase just for this laptop that we are developing in.
- Keep full workspace verification and formatting verification only before committing and pushing when the user asks you to commit. This codebase is slow to format check and do a full workspace/test runs.
- Before every requested commit or push run scripts/verify-before-commit.sh; never substitute cargo test --workspace --all-targets because it runs broad integration binaries serially.
- Run cargo fmt or similar commands only before committing, i.e. when the user asks you to commit then you do the cargo fmt
- Never insert or write the backtick character in any Markdown file. Use plain text, quotation marks, indentation, or another fit-for-purpose representation instead.

## Public Repository And GitHub Decorum

- Treat every GitHub issue, pull request, comment, release note, repository setting, and committed file as potentially permanent public material.
- Write GitHub content as concise, project-owned prose in English unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- GitHub issues must describe Astronomical goals, evidence, scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Do not publish raw agent opinions, dictation fragments, private working notes, or broad external-project audits.
- Cite public documentation, model cards, standards, and upstream APIs only when they establish compatibility, provenance, or licensing. Do not describe Astronomical as copied, ported, or derived from another implementation unless the user has explicitly approved actual source reuse and the required attribution is recorded.
- Never publish or commit personal names, user names, email addresses, phone numbers, private repository links, local endpoints, local model inventories, credentials, tokens, or machine-specific logs unless the user explicitly approves the exact disclosure.
- Before creating or editing public GitHub content, review it for local paths, personal details, credentials, stale internal terminology, and wording that suggests unapproved source reuse.
- No written language should convey a negative connutation about a person, entity or a programming library.

## Local Environment Boundaries

- Never hardwire a developer home directory, workstation path, local model path, local endpoint, or machine-specific hardware assumption into production code, tests, fixtures, qualification artifacts, documentation, GitHub content, or agent instructions.
- Resolve user-controlled locations through configuration, environment variables, platform-standard application directories, command-line arguments, or explicit user file selection.
- Tests must use temporary directories, repository fixtures, or clearly fictional placeholder paths that cannot identify a developer workstation.
- When upstream source is needed for research, discover its local location from the active environment. Refer to projects by name in repository content and never persist a personal checkout path.

## There are No Downstream Consumers or Dependencies

- There are no downstream consumers or other dependant applications -- hence no need for deprication or compatibilty shims or any other techniques. Work in a fail forward fashion.

## Coding Principles

- Code files should remain around the 500 lines marker not longer.
- Prioritize reduction of layers and abstractions while you are working.
- Any end-user-facing file-size or memory value must use decimal SI gigabytes: 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes. Do not show binary GiB values under a GB label.

## Keep Dependencies Updated to Latest Version

- Always make sure we are using the latest dependencies for this project.

## Naming Convensions in Variables

- prefill_chunck_tokens is the correct variable name to use for that intended purpose duing prompt processing. Never write or declare variable names like tokens or chunck_tokens when the intended purpose is prefill_chunck_tokens. Congruency and verbosity in variable names is a mandate.

- The term cache must never be used in abstraction in variable names, this codebase has many types of caches such as persistent_cache and various other caches in memory and for different purposes. Varaible names must be fully qualify what type of cache the code is talking about.
