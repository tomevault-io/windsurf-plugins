# Nameplate — agent notes

- SwiftPM menu bar app, zero dependencies. Building needs full Xcode (SwiftUI macros); if `xcode-select -p` is CommandLineTools, set `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app`.
- Build/test: `swift build`, `swift test`. Bundle: `./Scripts/package_app.sh [debug|release]` (signs Developer ID; `APP_IDENTITY="-"` for ad-hoc).
- Icon: `./Scripts/build_icon.sh` regenerates `Icon.icns` from `Icon-master.png` (falls back to `Scripts/render_icon.swift`).
- Sparkle: public key in `Scripts/package_app.sh` and `.mac-release.env`; private key in the maintainer's keychain/1Password (see release-private notes). Releases + appcast go through `Scripts/mac-release` (thin wrapper over the shared release-mac-app tooling; clone agent-scripts next to this repo).
- CLI lives at `Nameplate.app/Contents/Helpers/nameplate`; attention requests hand off via `~/Library/Application Support/Nameplate/attention.json` + Darwin notification.
- Plain AppKit lifecycle (no SwiftUI scenes): NSStatusItem + NSMenu, manual settings NSWindow. SwiftUI scene machinery (MenuBarExtra menus, Settings scene, URL events) is unreliable for menu-bar-only apps on current macOS.
- Overlay windows are click-through NSPanels at `.statusBar` level (higher levels block NSMenu); splash sits one level above. Controllers in `Sources/Nameplate` are app-lifetime singletons — observers are intentionally never removed.
- `NameplateCore` stays AppKit-free (identity, colors, fleet file) and is the only tested target.
- Version bumps: `version.env` (all platforms ship the same version: also bump `linux/*/Cargo.toml` and `windows/Directory.Build.props`). Changelog: one bullet per entry, one line.
- Ports: `windows/` (C#/.NET 8 WPF, named-pipe CLI, WTS session events; build on Windows — WPF needs it) and `linux/` (Rust + GTK4, X11 first, unix-socket CLI; `cargo test -p nameplate-core` runs anywhere, GTK binary needs libgtk-4). Parity is contract: FNV-1a hostname→palette hash, fleet.json schema, defaults (bottom corners rounded, bottom-left tag), luminance text rule — shared test vectors live in each port's core tests.
- Website: `docs/` on `main` = GitHub Pages at nameplate.sh (CNAME in docs/). Single-file `index.html`; the settings window is a live HTML remake with per-OS skins; social card regenerates from `docs/card.html`, DMG background from `assets/dmg-background.html` (render at 2x via a browser, see git history).
- Release artifacts: versioned + stable-name pairs (`Nameplate.zip`, `Nameplate.dmg`, `Nameplate-Windows-{x64,arm64}.zip`, `Nameplate-Linux-{x86_64,arm64}.tar.gz`) so `releases/latest/download/<stable>` always works; sign-and-notarize.sh emits zip+DMG, Windows/Linux artifacts are built on VMs/Docker and uploaded during the release's extra-asset wait window.
