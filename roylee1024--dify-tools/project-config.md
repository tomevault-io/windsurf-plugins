# Chrome Extension Development Guidelines

## Manifest.json

The [manifest.json](mdc:manifest.json) file is the configuration file for the extension. It defines:

- Basic metadata (name, version, description)
- Permissions required by the extension
- Extension resources (icons, scripts, HTML pages)
- Extension behavior (background scripts, content scripts)

## Extension Components

### Popup
The popup UI appears when users click the extension icon in the browser toolbar.
- Keep the popup UI simple and focused
- Design for limited screen space
- Avoid heavy operations that might cause the popup to freeze

### Background Script
Runs in the background and manages extension state.
- Use for long-running tasks
- Avoid heavy computation in the background script
- Use message passing to communicate with other parts of the extension

### Content Scripts
Run in the context of web pages.
- Use to interact with page content
- Avoid injecting unnecessary scripts
- Follow Chrome's security guidelines

### Options Page
Provides configuration settings for the extension.
- Group related settings together
- Provide clear descriptions for each setting
- Save settings automatically when changed

## Security Guidelines

### Permissions
- Request only the permissions you need
- Explain to users why each permission is needed
- Use optional permissions when possible

### Content Security Policy
- Set appropriate Content Security Policy in the manifest
- Avoid inline JavaScript
- Avoid `eval()` and other unsafe functions

### Data Storage
- Use Chrome Storage API for persistent data
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing
- Clean up data when it's no longer needed

## Performance Best Practices

- Minimize the use of background resources
- Use event-driven architecture
- Optimize assets for size
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

## Publishing Guidelines

- Provide clear descriptions and screenshots
- Keep the extension size under 10MB if possible
- Follow Chrome Web Store policies
- Test on different Chrome versions
- Provide regular updates and maintenance
