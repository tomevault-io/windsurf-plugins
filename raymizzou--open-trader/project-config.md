# Project Instructions

## Worktree Baseline

Start new isolated feature or fix work from the local `main` branch unless the
user explicitly selects another baseline. Create a separate branch and worktree
from `main`; do not derive the branch from an unrelated or dirty checkout.

## Merge Log Gate

Before merging any branch into `main`, update and commit its dated
operator-facing entry in `CHANGELOG.md`. Do not merge first and add the log
afterward.

## Verification Discipline

For any behavior change, especially changes that affect notifications, background
watchers, launchd jobs, screen sessions, or other long-running processes, do not
stop at unit tests.

Before reporting that the change is done:

1. Run the relevant automated tests and confirm the exact pass/fail output.
2. Run the affected command or workflow directly when it is practical, and check
   the real output.
3. If a background process can keep old code in memory, inspect running
   processes and service managers such as `screen` and `launchctl`.
4. Stop or restart old processes that are still using pre-change code.
5. Verify fresh logs from the new process, including PID/timestamp when useful,
   before claiming the live behavior has changed.

Do not describe a change as fully verified if only tests were run and the live
background process was not checked.

## Dashboard Acceptance Gate

Do not run `make acceptance` after intermediate modifications. Run focused
tests and direct workflow checks while developing, and run `make acceptance`
only as the final gate before asking the user to review or accept a completed
Dashboard task, unless the user explicitly requests it earlier. Its result is
the only review-readiness status:

- `PASS`: automated tests, real API/data, one live account/quote refresh, process version,
  logs, and desktop/mobile browser flows all passed.
- `FAIL`: a page, data, process, log, or test check failed.
- `BLOCKED`: the required browser or external environment is unavailable.

Only `PASS` may be described as complete, deployed successfully, or accepted.
`FAIL` must be fixed. `BLOCKED` must be reported as blocked and must not be
substituted with curl, fixtures, mocks, screenshots, or unit tests.

## Post-Acceptance Review Deployment

After `make acceptance` returns `PASS`, redeploy the exact accepted Git SHA
before asking the user to review it. Then verify the new process PID, working
directory, Git SHA, fresh logs, and an HTTP 200 response from the review URL.
Provide that URL so the user can open it directly.

This post-acceptance restart does not require another acceptance run when it
deploys the exact already-accepted SHA and makes no source or data changes.

## Optional UI Screenshots

Do not capture or require screenshots for Dashboard acceptance or handoff unless
the user explicitly asks for them. Missing screenshots do not affect `PASS`
status or block a task from being described as accepted, complete, or deployed.

## Task Handoff Gate

Before asking the user to review any completed Dashboard task, the agent must
run `make acceptance` as the final verification step. The user must not be
asked to run it manually.

- On `FAIL`, continue diagnosing and fixing, then rerun the gate.
- On `BLOCKED`, report the blocker; do not present the task for acceptance.
- Only on `PASS` may the agent provide the deployed URL and ask the user to
  review the result.
