# Release changelog maintenance

Maintain `UPCOMING_RELEASE.md` at the repo root as the living draft for the next GitHub release. Do this in **every chat**, without being asked.

## When to update

After completing work that is user-facing or release-note worthy:

- New features, nodes, models, UI, or workflows
- Enhancements to existing behavior
- Bug fixes (especially API/routing/model registry fixes)
- Breaking changes, renames, or migrations
- Notable docs/README changes tied to product behavior

Skip updates for: refactors with no user impact, formatting-only diffs, dependency bumps unless they fix something users care about.

## What to do

1. **Read** `UPCOMING_RELEASE.md` before finishing the task.
2. **Append or edit** the right section (New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes, Migration).
3. Use a **one-line summary + short detail** (table row or bullet). Be specific (model names, node types, param names).
4. Tag status: **(committed)** once in git, **(in progress)** while only local.
5. Bump **Last updated** date at the top.
6. If scope is large, add a row to **Highlights** — do not rewrite the whole file.

## Do not

- Wait for the user to ask
- Create a separate changelog file unless they ask
- Commit `UPCOMING_RELEASE.md` unless the user requests a commit
- Remove shipped history; move items to **Shipped history** only after a release ships

## Example entry

```markdown
### My Feature **(in progress)**
- Added X node with Y/Z controls for fal.ai `model-id`
```

When marking done in the same session, change `(in progress)` → `(committed)` if changes were committed.
