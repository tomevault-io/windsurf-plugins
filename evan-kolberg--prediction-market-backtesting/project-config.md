# Repository Notes For Agents

This repo is a prediction-market backtesting research project. Optimize for
honest simulation, durable runner behavior, and clear operational docs. Do not
paper over failures that could make a reader trust misleading results.

## Scope And Worktree Safety

- Expect a dirty worktree. Never revert or overwrite existing changes you did
  not make unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the request. Avoid unrelated refactors and
  formatting churn.
- Never push directly to `main`.

## README And Docs

- Do not touch other parts of the root README. Only touch the table of
  contents.
- All other documentation changes belong under `docs/`; do not bloat the root
  README body.
- Only change the README TOC when it needs to be in sync with docs.
- Do not trim the README TOC. All docs and subheaders should be properly
  recorded there.
- Do not add extra things to the root README.
- `docs/project-status.md` is the place for roadmap, known issues, and recently
  fixed history; include PR links there instead of in the root README body.
- When touching MkDocs config, theme CSS, code-fence behavior, or docs assets,
  verify with:

```bash
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

## Backtest Realism Priorities

Treat these as high-value issues:

- broken direct runner entrypoints
- `make backtest` or menu behavior drifting from docs
- vendor archive and local-source correctness
- API handler event-loop blocking
- memory growth that can accumulate forever
- timestamp or datetime warnings in normal runs
- examples that use stale markets, fragile dates, or false performance claims
- optimizer math, scoring, or ranking behavior that misleads research decisions

Treat expected losing strategies separately from bugs. Negative PnL or
`AccountBalanceNegative` is not automatically a code defect.

Local PMXT filtered-cache growth is intentional. Do not "fix" it by default.

## Backtest Runner Conventions

- Direct script runners must work as imports and as direct scripts:

```bash
uv run python path/to/runner.py
```

- Use the shared `_script_helpers` bootstrap pattern for repo-root imports
  instead of one-off `sys.path` hacks.
- Timing/progress output should stay enabled by default in `main.py`.
- `BACKTEST_ENABLE_TIMING=0` is the explicit quiet opt-out.
- Nautilus output should stay enabled by default at the repo layer.
- The default repo-layer `nautilus_log_level` is `INFO`; do not downgrade it to
  `WARNING` or quieter unless the user explicitly asks.
- Treat changes that hide Nautilus runner output by default as regressions.
- Public runner files should carry their real inputs: `DATA`, `REPLAYS`,
  `STRATEGY_CONFIGS`, `EXECUTION`, `EXPERIMENT`, plot panels, summary report
  paths, and optimizer windows.

## Optimizers And Research Notebooks

- The parameter-search objective is per-window:

```text
score = pnl - 0.5 * max_drawdown_currency - penalties
```

- Rank training candidates by the median of per-window scores. If holdout
  windows are configured, rerun only the train top-k on holdout and rank by
  median holdout score, with train score as the tie-breaker.
- For joint-portfolio optimizers, compute drawdown on the summed equity curve,
  not by summing per-market drawdowns. This is intentional because
  diversification can reduce joint drawdown.
- TPE/continuous `parameter_space` behavior must be tested separately from
  discrete random-grid `parameter_grid` behavior.
- Notebook optimizer examples use bundled slugs only as examples. Users should
  plug in the markets and windows they actually want to study, then warm those
  exact slugs before scaling notebook runs.
- Before running notebook optimizers, run the same slugs and timestamps through
  a regular runner so PMXT source and cache-fill progress is visible. Otherwise
  a cold local-cache -> R2/archive fill can take a long time with little
  notebook output.
- For many-market research, prefer downloading PMXT raw dumps first:

```bash
make download-pmxt-raws DESTINATION=/path/to/pmxt_raws
```

Keeping raw hours on disk avoids refetching the same hourly raw files from R2
for each new market.

## PMXT Data Defaults

- PMXT filtered cache is enabled by default at:

```text
~/.cache/nautilus_trader/pmxt
```

- Public PMXT runners pin local raw first, then archive, usually:

```text
local:/Volumes/LaCie/pmxt_raws
archive:r2v2.pmxt.dev
archive:r2.pmxt.dev
```

- Root setup docs should include `duckdb`.
- `docs/setup.md` and PMXT docs should describe cache default-on behavior and
  timing output default-on behavior, with `BACKTEST_ENABLE_TIMING=0` as the
  opt-out.

## Verification

Baseline local gates before opening or merging a PR:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pytest tests/ -q
```

Useful representative smoke checks:

```bash
uv run python backtests/kalshi_trade_tick_breakout.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_trade_tick_vwap_reversion.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_quote_tick_ema_crossover.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_quote_tick_independent_multi_replay_runner.py
```

If core internals, optimizer math, loader behavior, runner bootstrap, plotting,
reporting, or backtest behavior changed, run focused tests plus representative
