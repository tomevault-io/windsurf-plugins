description: Align and center a specific word across multiple images using OCR (Tesseract) to produce documentary-style "word focus" cuts. Use when the user wants to center/lock a keyword across screenshots or video frames, create news-ticker style alignment, produce same-word cuts for After Effects / Premiere, or batch-crop frames so a chosen word stays perfectly centered and same-size. Invoked via the installed `quick-cuts` CLI.

# TextFocus (Quick Cuts) Skill

A Python-based OCR alignment tool that finds a target word in each input image and produces an output image where that word is centered and scaled to a consistent size. Designed for creating documentary / news-style video cuts where the same word stays locked in place across different footage.

## When to use this skill

Activate when the user asks to:
- "Center the word X across these images/frames"
- "Align all these screenshots on the word Y"
- "Make a Warp-style / documentary cut where a word stays fixed"
- Batch-process video frames so a keyword is locked to the center
- Normalize word size and position across many images

If the user only wants generic image cropping (no OCR / no target word), this skill is not the right fit.

## Prerequisites

Before running anything, verify the environment:

1. **Tesseract OCR must be installed on the system** (Python-only install is not enough):
   - macOS: `brew install tesseract`
   - Linux: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
   - Windows: installer from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   - Check with: `tesseract --version`
2. **Python 3.8+**
3. **The `quick-cuts` CLI itself** — install from this repo with uv:
   ```bash
   uv tool install .
   quick-cuts --help
   ```
   If `quick-cuts` is not on PATH after install, run `uv tool update-shell` once and reopen the shell.

If Tesseract is missing, tell the user to install it — do not try to work around it.

## Primary tool: `quick-cuts`

```bash
quick-cuts <images> -w "<target_word>" [options]
```

`<images>` can be a glob (`images/*.png`), a directory (`images/`), or individual files.

### Common options

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-w, --word` | Target word to center (required) | — |
| `-o, --output` | Output directory | `./aligned_<word>` |
| `-s, --size` | Output canvas `WxH` | `1920x1080` |
| `--word-height` | Target word height in px | `100` |
| `--background` | `white` \| `black` \| `transparent` \| `dominant` | `dominant` |
| `--partial` | Match words starting with the target (e.g. `warp` → `warpdotdev`) | off |
| `--workers` | Parallel worker count | CPU count |

### Typical invocations

```bash
# Basic — center "breaking" across PNGs
quick-cuts images/*.png -w "breaking"

# Partial match — useful when the target is a prefix of a longer word
quick-cuts images/ -w "warp" --partial

# 4K output with larger word
quick-cuts images/ -w "alert" -s 3840x2160 --word-height 200

# Vertical / social-media format, transparent background
quick-cuts frames/ -w "viral" -s 1080x1920 --background transparent
```

Transparent background forces `.png` output regardless of input format.

## Working guidance for Claude


When the user asks for a word-alignment task:

1. **Confirm the target word and the input path** before running — mistakes here waste a batch.
2. **Check image formats** — supported: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`.
3. **Run once on a small sample first** (1–3 images) to verify OCR actually finds the word, before processing a full folder.
4. **If OCR misses**, suggest in order: `--partial`, higher-resolution source images, better contrast. Do not silently change the target word.
5. **Output files** are named `aligned_<original>` in the output dir. Tell the user where they landed (`output_dir.absolute()` is logged).
6. **Progress / failures** are printed to stdout. Surface the "Failed to find word in:" list back to the user so they know which frames need manual attention.
7. **If `quick-cuts` is not found**, the user hasn't installed it yet — point them at `uv tool install .` from this repo, not `python quick_cuts.py`.
