# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repo. Optimized for the review
and implementation flow used by `/review`, `/security-review`, and similar
tools.

## Repo at a glance

- Single Go module: `github.com/ironsh/iron-proxy` (Go 1.26+).
- One binary: `cmd/iron-proxy` (the MITM egress proxy).
- Core packages live under `internal/`. The transform pipeline lives in
  `internal/transform/` with one subpackage per transform
  (`allowlist`, `secrets`, `bodycapture`, `headerallowlist`, `annotate`,
  `judge`, `grpc`, `hmacsign`, `oauth`, `awsauth`, `gcpauth`).
- Integration tests against real backends (AWS, 1Password, GCP, Postgres,
  gRPC, MCP) live in `integration_test/`. Unit tests sit next
  to the code they exercise.

The README is the source of truth for product behavior. When in doubt about
intended behavior, read it before changing code.

## Go conventions

- Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for assertions. Never
  `t.Errorf` / `t.Fatalf` for value comparisons when `require.Equal` would do.
- Table-driven tests are the default for any function with more than two
  meaningful input shapes. Name the table `cases` or `tests`, iterate with
  `t.Run(tc.name, ...)`.
- `require.NoError(err)` on every error returned from a function under test.
  Never silently ignore errors. In tests, the only acceptable place to drop
  an error is inside a background goroutine (e.g. an HTTP handler) and it
  must use `_` with a comment explaining why the error is unreachable or
  irrelevant.
- Production code: never silently swallow errors. If an error truly cannot
  occur, suppress with `_` and a one-line comment stating why.
- Respect `context.Context` on every network or I/O call. Background
  goroutines need an explicit lifecycle (shutdown channel, context, or
  errgroup).
- Prefer the standard library and the existing dependencies in `go.mod` over
  adding new ones.

## Simplicity

- Aim for the smallest change that solves the problem. Don't add features,
  abstractions, or configuration knobs the task didn't ask for.
- Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. Two similar code
  blocks are fine; if the same shape appears a third time, factor a helper
  and update the call sites in the same change.
- Prefer deleting code over adding it. If a refactor leaves dead branches,
  unused config fields, or backwards-compat shims behind, remove them.
- No premature interfaces. Introduce an interface when a second concrete
  implementation actually exists, not in anticipation of one.

## Security invariants (do not weaken)

These are load-bearing properties of the proxy. Treat any change that
weakens one as blocking until discussed.

- **Default-deny egress.** Every request must pass the `allowlist` transform
  (or an equivalent policy gate) before the proxy dials upstream. Code paths
  that reach `net.Dial` / `http.Transport.RoundTrip` before policy
  evaluation are not acceptable.
- **Upstream IP deny.** Resolved upstream addresses are checked against
  `proxy.upstream_deny_cidrs` (loopback and `169.254.169.254` by default)
  before dialing. Changes to the dialer must keep this check in place.
- **Secret confinement.** Real secret values returned from any
  `internal/transform/secrets` resolver must never appear in:
  - logs (structured or otherwise),
  - error strings returned to a caller or surfaced in audit events,
  - panic messages,
  - responses sent back to the client.
  Proxy tokens (the sandbox-side placeholder) may appear in audit logs
  per the README; real upstream credentials must not.
- **Audit integrity.** Every proxied request emits a JSON audit entry and,
  when OTLP is configured, an OTEL log record with the same shape. Both
  carry `action`, `request_transforms` (with per-transform decisions and
  `rejected_by` on denials). Changes that make these fields optional, drop
  them on error paths, or shortcut emission are not acceptable.
- **Cleanup on error.** Any error path that returns to the caller must
  close opened upstream connections, release any acquired semaphore /
  circuit-breaker slot (see `internal/transform/judge`), and still emit
  the audit event for the request.
- **MCP and Postgres policy gates.** The MCP interceptor's default-deny
  tool allowlist and the Postgres proxy's `SET ROLE` injection /
  role-mutation rejection are both load-bearing. Don't add bypass paths.

## Concurrency

- Flag any new shared mutable state without synchronization. The proxy
  serves many concurrent requests; transforms and resolvers are reused
  across goroutines.
- Caches (LRU cert cache, secret-resolver TTL caches) must be safe for
  concurrent use. `failure_ttl` exists so a transient backend outage does
  not get pinned by a long success TTL — don't collapse the two.

## Review guidance (for `/review`, `/security-review`, code-review agents)

When reviewing changes in this repo:

**Focus on:**
- The security invariants above. Cite the specific invariant a change
  violates rather than describing the symptom in the abstract.
- Concurrency correctness, error-path cleanup, and context propagation.
- Missing or weak tests for the categories under "Testing expectations".
- Behavior drift from what the README documents.

**Do not comment on:**
