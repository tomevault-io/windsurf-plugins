- this is a motion canvas project
- no react is installed, DO NOT USE REACT
- use the motion canvas docs where necessary https://motioncanvas.io/docs/
- whenever you create a new component in src/components, make it extend a motion canvas component at least Layout or a more specific one
- always try to build after doing changes to verify it is still working, if there are any errors in the build debug it until it works. If it says in the output "found X errors" it did actually find errors
- when using animations from animations.ts, DO NOT modify the default duration
- when you create a new scene make sure to add it to project.ts
- when importing a video you need to add ?url
- when creating a new scene always make sure to use yield* fadeTransition(1);
- use rgba(0,0,0,0) instead of transparent
- durations: make animations 0.5 by default, typewriter 1
- always add a "scene_end" time event at the end of a scene
- when you pass an image as a src to a Node/Component, never use the path string, always import it and pass it to the component as an object
