# Language Standards

## Scope

- This rule applies to **all files and all languages** in this repository.
- It controls **which language to use where**:
  - **Documentation, comments, commit messages**: English
  - **Interactive conversation with the user in Cursor**: Generally match the user's input language

## Rules

1. **Documentation language**
   - All new documentation (e.g. `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, API docs) must be written in **English**.
   - When editing existing docs, **prefer** converting or expanding content in English.

2. **Code comments**
   - Write all code comments in **English**.
   - If existing comments are in another language and you need to touch them, convert them to English when reasonable.

3. **Commit messages**
   - Commit messages must be written in **English**, following the project's Conventional Commits style where applicable.

4. **Conversation with the user**
   - When responding to the user inside Cursor, **prefer using the same language as the user's input for that message**.
   - Regardless of the conversation language, when you need to show code, comments, or documentation content, ensure the **content itself** is in English.

## Examples

- ✅ Good (documentation)
  - `README.md` sections, headings, and prose are in English.

- ✅ Good (code comments)
  - `// Handle screen capture permission request on macOS 12.3+`

- ✅ Good (conversation)
  - Explain design decisions and answer questions in the same language as the user's input, but show code and comments in English.

- ❌ Avoid
  - Writing non-English comments inside source files.
  - Adding non-English text to documentation files (except where absolutely necessary, such as proper nouns or unavoidable context).
