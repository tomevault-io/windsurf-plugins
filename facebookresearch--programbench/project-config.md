## Project Overview

ProgramBench evaluates whether LM-based SWE-agents can reverse-engineer black-box software systems. The workflow: take an open-source CLI tool (mostly Rust/Go), compile it into a Docker image with source removed, then have an LM agent re-implement it from scratch by interacting only with the binary. Behavioral tests (also LM-generated) score the re-implementation.

## Quick reference

```bash
uv sync                  # install deps
uv run programbench      # run the CLI
uv run pytest            # run tests
```

## Project structure

```
src/programbench/
  cli/          # typer CLI (presentation layer — pretty printing, arg parsing)
  data/         # shipped data files (templates, configs, etc.)
  *.py          # core logic (no CLI concerns)
tests/
```

The CLI (`cli/`) and core logic are kept separate. All typer/rich/display code lives in `cli/`; everything else is importable without CLI dependencies.

## Style guide

1. Target python 3.10 or higher
2. Use python with type annotations. Use `list` instead of `List`.
3. Use `pathlib` instead of `os.path`. Use `Path.read_text()` over `with ...open()` constructs.
4. Use `typer` to add interfaces
5. Keep code comments to a minimum and only highlight particularly logically challenging things
6. Do not append to the README unless specifically requested
7. Use `jinja` for formatting templates
8. Use `dataclass` for keeping track config
9. Do not catch exceptions unless explicitly told to.
10. Write concise, short, minimal code.
11. In most cases, avoid initializing variables just to pass them to a function. Instead just pass the expression to the function directly.
12. Not every exception has to be caught. Exceptions are a good way to show problems to a user.
13. This repository rewards minimal code. Try to be as concise as possible.
14. Do not catch error conditions explicitly if they would fail anyway.
15. Do not use overly defensive `.get()` calls. Prefer normal dictionary access.
    It's better to have a clear failure than to silently fall back to incorrect values.
16. Do not use `try`/`except` blocks just to reraise some other exception. Just let it fail, it's clearer to the user this way.
17. Do not factor out tiny functions

### Style examples

Rule 11 — pass expressions directly:
```python
# bad
a = func()
Class(a)

# good
Class(func())
```

Rule 14 — don't guard what would fail anyway:
```python
# bad
input = input()
if not "=" in input:
    raise ValueError("Input must be of form a=b")
x, y = input.split("=")

# good
x, y = input().split("=")
```

## Test style

1. Use `pytest`, not `unittest`.
2. **Do not mock/patch anything that you're not explicitly asked to.**
3. Avoid writing trivial tests. Every test should test for at least one, preferably multiple points of failure.
4. Avoid splitting up code in multiple lines like `a = func()\nassert a == b`. Instead, just do `assert func() == b`.
5. The first argument to `pytest.mark.parametrize` should be a tuple (not a string! not a list!), the second argument must be a list (not a tuple!).

### Test example

```python
# bad
result = func()
assert result == b

# good
assert func() == b
```

## Tooling

- **Package manager**: `uv`
- **CLI framework**: `typer`
- **Templating**: `jinja2`
- **Testing**: `pytest`
