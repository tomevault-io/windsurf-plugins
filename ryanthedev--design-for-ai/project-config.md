# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a Claude Code plugin that teaches visual design principles from *Design for Hackers* — helping AI and developers make informed decisions about typography, color, composition, proportions, visual hierarchy, motion, interaction, and responsive design.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/design-for-ai` | Full design workflow (CHECKER or APPLIER mode) |
| `/design` | Establish design foundations — purpose, audience, aesthetic direction |
| `/exam` | Theory-backed design audit — find what's wrong and explain WHY |
| `/brand` | Strip AI design tells, add intentional character |
| `/fonts` | Select, pair, and configure typography |
| `/color` | Build a color system from color science up |
| `/flow` | Add motion, interaction states, responsive behavior |
| `/hone` | Final quality pass — every principle checked |

```

## Skill File Format

Each skill is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skillname
description: When to use this skill - triggers skill selection
---

# Skill Title

[Workflow steps, phases, decision tables, output formats]
```

The `description` field is critical — it tells Claude when to invoke the skill.

## Installation

Install via the RTD marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ryanthedev/rtd-claude-inn
/plugin install design-for-ai@rtd
```
