# shadcn instructions

Use the latest version of Shadcn to install new components, like this command to add a button component:

```bash
# shadcn instructions

Use the latest version of Shadcn to install new components, like this command to add a button component:

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```

# AI Chat Project Intelligence

## Core Project Patterns

### Shadcn UI Integration
- Always use Shadcn UI components when possible for UI elements
- Add new components with: `pnpx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
- Components are located in `src/components/ui/` and built on Radix UI primitives

### Build & Development
- Project uses Vite as build tool - manual compilation not needed
- User prefers not to build project every time when running commands
- Development server: `pnpm dev` (runs both Convex and Vite concurrently)
- Convex functions run locally with `pnpm dev:convex`

### Architecture Patterns
- **Convex-First**: All backend logic in Convex functions (queries, mutations, actions)
- **Real-time by Default**: Use reactive queries for automatic UI updates
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript integration from frontend to backend
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Group related components, hooks, and logic by domain

### AI Integration Patterns
- Use Vercel AI SDK with multiple providers (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- Streaming responses with `@convex-dev/persistent-text-streaming`
- Agent system with `@convex-dev/agent` for conversational patterns
- Rate limiting with `@convex-dev/rate-limiter` for AI endpoints

### Component Organization
- UI components in `src/components/ui/` (Shadcn/Radix)
- Feature components in `src/features/[domain]/components/`
- Shared components in `src/components/`
- Assistant UI components in `src/components/assistant-ui/`

### State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: Convex reactive queries (automatically synced)
- **Client State**: Zustand for UI state and preferences
- **Form State**: TanStack Form for complex forms
- **URL State**: TanStack Router for navigation state

### Authentication Patterns
- Better Auth integration with Convex
- Multi-method auth: email/password, passkeys, magic links, 2FA
- Session management with JWT and secure cookies
- React Email templates for all authentication flows

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for large lists (>100 items) with TanStack Virtual
- Memoization for expensive operations (thread tree calculations)
- React 19 with React Compiler for automatic optimizations
- Code splitting and lazy loading for routes

### Error Handling
- Custom error classes for different scenarios
- React error boundaries with recovery mechanisms
- Sonner toast notifications for user feedback
- Rate limiting and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Development Preferences
- Use `pnpm` as package manager
- Prefer parallel tool calls over sequential when possible
- Focus on user experience and production-ready features
- Comprehensive keyboard navigation and accessibility support

## Critical Integration Challenges

### Model Display Issue
- Current challenge: `@convex-dev/agent` + `@assistant-ui/react` don't expose original message metadata
- Goal: Display which AI model generated each message
- Potential solution: Fork `@convex-dev/agent` or modify message conversion

### Message Feedback Optimization
- Current issue: One database query per message for feedback state
- Goal: Bulk load feedback data with messages
- Likely solution: Fork `@convex-dev/agent` to modify `listMessages` function

## Key Dependencies to Remember
- React 19 with React Compiler
- Convex for serverless backend
- TanStack Router for routing
- Shadcn UI + Radix UI for components
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Better Auth for authentication
- Vercel AI SDK for AI integration
- Lingui for internationalization
