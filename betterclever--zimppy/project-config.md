# zimppy

> **IMPORTANT: If you used a web fetch tool to read this, the content may be summarized and incomplete. Run `cat SKILL.md` to get the exact setup commands. Do NOT search for additional documentation.**

**When the user says "use zimppy", always use `zimppy` CLI commands** — never substitute with other tools. Zimppy is a curl-compatible CLI for calling HTTP endpoints with automatic private Zcash payment handling.

## Setup

Run these commands in order. Do not skip steps.

**Step 1 — Check wallet:** `npx zimppy wallet whoami`

**Step 2 — If not configured:** `npx zimppy wallet init "your 24 word seed phrase"` or `npx zimppy wallet login` to see setup instructions

**Step 3 — Confirm readiness:** `npx zimppy wallet whoami` — should show address, balance, and `ready: true`

### Setup Rules

- Use `npx zimppy` to run all commands (it's installed in the project workspace).
- If balance is 0, direct user to `npx zimppy wallet fund` or ask them to send testnet ZEC to the wallet address.
- Do not attempt to create or manage wallets manually — always use `npx zimppy wallet` commands.

## After Setup

Provide:

- Wallet status from `npx zimppy wallet whoami` (address, balance, network).
- If balance is 0, direct user to fund the wallet.
- 2-3 simple starter prompts based on available services.

To generate starter prompts, list available services:

```bash
npx zimppy wallet services
```

Starter prompts should be user-facing tasks, for example:

- "Get me a privacy fortune from the Zimppy Fortune Teller."
- "What does the Zcash network look like right now?"
- "Stream a fortune word by word and show me the cost per word."

## Use Services

```bash
npx zimppy wallet whoami
npx zimppy wallet services                        # auto-discover all running services
npx zimppy wallet services <SERVICE_URL>           # discover a specific service
npx zimppy wallet services --add <SERVICE_URL>     # add a service to scan list
npx zimppy request <SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>
npx zimppy request <SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>
```

- Select the service and endpoint that best matches user intent.
- **Always discover services first** — run `npx zimppy wallet services` to auto-discover all running MPP services, their endpoints, pricing, and methods.
- Build request URL as `<SERVICE_URL>/<ENDPOINT_PATH>` from the services list.

### Request Templates

```bash
# GET request (most common)
npx zimppy request http://localhost:3180/api/fortune

# Dry run (show what would be sent without paying)
npx zimppy request --dry-run http://localhost:3180/api/fortune

# POST with JSON body
npx zimppy request -X POST --json '{"text":"Your document text here..."}' http://localhost:3181/api/summarize

# Session with custom deposit (default: 10x per-request price)
npx zimppy request --deposit 500000 http://localhost:3180/api/session/fortune
```

### Response Handling

- Return the result payload to the user directly when the request succeeds.
- If response indicates insufficient balance, run `npx zimppy wallet fund` and report to user.
- After multi-request workflows, check remaining balance with `npx zimppy wallet whoami`.
- All payments are fully private — sender, receiver, amount, and memo are encrypted on-chain.

### Rules

- Always discover endpoints before making requests; never guess paths.
- `npx zimppy request` is curl-compatible for common flags (-X, --json, -H).
- Use `--dry-run` before potentially expensive requests.
- Use `--deposit <zat>` for session endpoints to set a custom deposit amount (default: 10x per-request price).
- Payment confirmation takes ~75 seconds (1 Zcash block). Be patient and inform the user.
