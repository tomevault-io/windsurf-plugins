# scope-clock — agent brief

You are picking up a firmware project mid-scaffold. Read this fully before editing.

## What this is

A ground-up rewrite of the **SCTV Scope Clock** firmware (an X-Y oscilloscope-tube
clock) into a **thin vector-rendering client**, paired with an **ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi
bridge** (M5Stack AtomS3U). The display MCU does only two hard-real-time jobs —
steer the CRT beam and keep time — and everything networked/smart lives off-device.

- Derivative of https://github.com/nixiebunny/SCTVcode (David Forbes / Cathode
  Corner), **GPL-2.0-or-later**. Keep that license; paste the full GPL text into
  `LICENSE` before any distribution.
- Original hardware: **Teensy 3.6** (internal dual 12-bit DAC → X/Y, digital blank
  → Z), **DS3232** RTC (I2C), rotary encoder + button, centering pots.

## Architecture (already reflected in the tree)

    bridge-esp32/   ESP32-S3: Wi-Fi, NTP, (later) MQTT. Speaks shared/protocol.h.
    display-teensy/ Teensy: renders draw lists + keeps time. THE THIN CLIENT.
    shared/         protocol.h — one source of truth, both projects `-I ../shared`.

Data flow: host/bridge pushes **draw lists** + `SET_TIME` + banners down; the
device sends input events + status up. A small set of **local faces** render from
the RTC so the clock is autonomous when the network is down — that is the whole
reason the device keeps an RTC.

Physical (zero-hardware-mod route the owner chose):
- Rear **USB-A host** jack ← AtomS3U → Wi-Fi/time/notifications.
- **Micro-USB device** jack ← a computer → USB **MIDI** (drives the `midiscope` /
  `midichord` faces) and USB audio. The MK66 has two independent USB controllers,
  so the bridge on the back and a DAW on the front run at once.

## Current state

**P0–P4 are done and running on hardware.** The render engine, the NTP-
disciplined RTC over a USB-host link, and the generic draw-list path all work.
**47 faces** — dials, digital, the five Platonic solids, a tesseract, generative
curves, digital rain, a real star chart and celestial globe, a centring target,
and two driven live by USB-MIDI — plus `PushList` / `Banner` / `SetMode` /
`SetBrightness` / `SetHz` from the host, MQTT + Home Assistant discovery on the
bridge, host-uploadable face templates, and a web config page.

Faces live in `faces_time/_3d/_gen/_midi.cpp` behind `faces_impl.h`; `faces.cpp`
is only the registry and the knob/button navigation. **Face order is the wire
id** — append, never insert. The bridge's `kFaces[]` carries each name with its
family group, and MQTT discovery, the web picker and the API all derive from
that one table. `tools/check_faces.py` proves it still matches the device's
registry and `kFamilies` runs, and that the six typeface names agree across the
device, the bridge and the page — from source alone, so run it after adding a
face or a font.
The bridge flashes over Wi-Fi (`pio run -e atoms3u_ota -t upload`); the Teensy
flashes in one command (`pio run -t upload`).

Upstream `SCTVcode/*.ino` is still the reference for anything not yet ported —
clone it alongside.

## Hard-won details (each of these cost hours; do not rediscover them)

- **Brightness is beam dwell per dot, and it cannot be a constant.** What the eye
  reads is beam-on time per refresh, which depends on how many dots a frame has.
  `vec::tuneDwell` steers it on measured frame time. Speeding up rendering
  *dims* the tube unless the dwell grows to compensate — that is not a bug.
- **Size every face in the host sim before flashing.** `scratchpad/hostsim/faces6`
  sweeps 1100 frames per face and reports the worst extent and worst-case dot
  cost. A single sampled frame is not enough: the tesseract and the tunnel both
  ran off the tube only partway through a rotation, and `sector` only reaches
  95% of the frame budget at 23:59:59.
- **A face switch overruns one frame.** The dwell is tuned for the previous
  face's dot count, so jumping from a sparse face to a dense one reports a wild
  `frameUs` (49ms was observed) until `tuneDwell` reconverges a few frames later.
  Self-correcting; not a bug to chase.
- **Scope music is the RATIO between two channels, not their sum.** Put the
  lower note on X and the upper on Y and a fifth draws the 3:2 figure a fifth
  actually is. Summing both notes into both axes — the obvious implementation —
  destroys exactly the thing worth seeing, because then neither axis is any one
  note. Also: path length scales with cycle count, so dense figures must be
  drawn *smaller* or they blow the frame (a semitone cluster is 16:15 and wants
  37ms of a 16.7ms frame at full size).
- **USB audio in is HALF DONE and off by default.** `hal/audio.h` +
  `audio_usb.cpp` hand both DACs to the Audio library's DMA so a stereo pair
  drives X/Y directly. It genuinely draws — a circle and a 3:2 figure rendered
  from the Mac at 44.1kHz — but the Teensy still watchdog-resets when the host
  *tears down* the audio stream, so there is no button for it in the web UI.
  Enter it with `2` on the front-jack serial console, leave with `f`. What is
  already established, so it need not be re-bisected:
    * `AudioMemory(12)` starves the moment audio actually streams — both USB
      directions allocate. 40 blocks is what made the first stream work at all.
