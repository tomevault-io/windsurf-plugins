description: Using functional over imperative style
---

Strongly prefer using functional style over imperative. That includes but is not limited to:

	1.	Prefer Immutability: instead of modifying state, create new structures with changes
	2.	Guarantee Function Purity:
	•	Guideline: Analyze function bodies to ensure outputs depend solely on inputs; warn when external state is read or modified.
	3.	Promote Modular, Composable Design:
	•	Guideline: Encourage the decomposition of tasks into small, reusable functions and support refactoring into higher-order functions and function composition (e.g., using combinators like map, filter, and reduce).
	4.	Support Declarative Constructs:
	•	Guideline: Recommend replacing imperative loops with declarative data transformation constructs and pattern matching when available.
	5.	Integrate Robust Error Handling:
	•	Guideline: Suggest the use of algebraic data types (e.g., Option, Either, Result) and monadic error patterns to handle exceptional conditions explicitly.
	7.	Leverage the Type System:
	•	Guideline: Utilize static type checking and inference to enforce contracts; highlight type mismatches that might indicate unintended side effects.
	8.	Encourage Concurrency-Ready Patterns:
	•	Guideline: Identify stateless functions and immutable data as candidates for safe concurrent execution; recommend parallel processing libraries when appropriate.
