# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This is the active Face LoRA Dataset Selector product repository.

Treat repository state, code, Issues, PRs, and current user instruction as authoritative. Do not rely on chat memory alone.

Repository truth and execution authorization are different:
- repository artifacts prove what exists or happened;
- only the current user instruction or an explicitly preserved authorization record proves what should be executed now.

## Required bootstrap

Before substantial work on an existing task:

1. read `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`;
2. distinguish **Current objective / Next action** from **Accepted future directions**;
3. inspect the actual product branch and recent relevant merged/open/Draft PRs;
4. detect stale summaries before acting;
5. read `.project/HANDOFF.md` only as supplementary context;
6. follow only the Issues/Decision Records needed for the current task;
7. verify that the active slice is actually authorized rather than merely present in a backlog, branch, Issue, or Draft PR.

If repository reality is newer than PROJECT_STATE, repair PROJECT_STATE before relying on it.

## Repository change rule

- All normal repository changes go through a scoped branch + PR into `main`.
- Do not write directly to `main`.
- Release preparation also goes through a PR. Publishing is triggered only by the machine-readable `.project/release_gate.json` after explicit human acceptance.
- A completion PR must leave `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` describing the expected **post-merge** canonical state, not the temporary pre-merge state.
- When a PR completes an Issue, prefer `Closes #N` in the PR body so Issue closure and post-merge state converge together.
- `.project/HANDOFF.md` must not duplicate current project state.

## Plan continuity and execution authorization

Confirmed future work must not live only in chat.

When the user confirms a future direction but does not authorize immediate implementation:

1. create or update a focused GitHub Issue containing the detailed scope;
2. add a compact entry to `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md -> Accepted future directions`;
3. mark its state truthfully, for example:
   - **ACCEPTED — NOT SCHEDULED**;
   - **RESEARCH ONLY — IMPLEMENTATION NOT AUTHORIZED**;
   - **EVALUATE ONLY — IMPLEMENTATION NOT AUTHORIZED**;
   - **DEFERRED / NON-BLOCKING**;
4. synchronize that state before moving on to unrelated implementation.

An Issue, branch, Draft PR, backlog entry, PROJECT_STATE item, or prior-agent action is **not** execution authorization by itself.

To start a product slice, the current user instruction must select or confirm that slice. Once selected, represent it under Current objective / Next action and the active branch/PR.

When a release umbrella, roadmap, accepted plan, or major tracker is closed/superseded, perform a **carry-forward audit**. Every unresolved accepted direction must be explicitly one of:
- completed;
- migrated to a current tracker;
- rejected/superseded with rationale;
- retained as accepted/deferred/research/evaluation-only.

Never silently drop unresolved accepted work because the old tracker closed.

A closed Issue with unchecked, deferred, or future items does not prove those items were completed. Check its closure disposition and successor trackers.

## Product branch

Stable product branch:
`main`

Current next-release umbrella:
Issue #60 — v0.4

## Architecture invariants

- Prefer feature-first modular boundaries.
- Qt presentation -> `SelectorApplication` -> feature backends.
- Backend feature packages must remain Qt-free.
- Optional feature removal should not destructively break unrelated modules.
- Do not introduce microservices/local HTTP merely to claim frontend/backend separation.
- Do not broaden a bounded feature extraction into a whole-application UI rewrite.

## Repository layout invariant

- Product implementation lives under `src/`.
- Tracked runtime assets live under `resources/`.
- Dependency manifests live under `requirements/`.
- `tests/`, `tools/`, `packaging/`, `docs/`, and `openspec/` own their respective concerns.
- Root-level `app.py` and `text_detector.py` are compatibility/entry shims only; do not grow product implementation back into them.
- Do not add a new top-level product directory just because no existing owner was checked first.
- Path moves are atomic: update imports, resources, CI, packaging, launch/install scripts, tests, and state in the same PR.

## Reuse-first

Before custom-building mature generic capability, inspect existing maintained solutions and verify fit, license, compatibility, and lifecycle cost.

## Validation cadence

Use risk-based validation:
- destructive/data-loss/startup/core-save-export/persistence risks require prompt human verification when automated confidence is insufficient;
- bounded reversible changes with relevant passing automation may remain HUMAN UNVERIFIED until an explicit checkpoint;
- deferred human QA must remain tracked in GitHub.

## Source/data safety

- Do not casually modify the original source tool folder.
- Source Organizer must be tested on a disposable/copied dataset before original Valby data.
- Prefer shared verified model/dependency caches.
- Research/temp output should not default to C:.
