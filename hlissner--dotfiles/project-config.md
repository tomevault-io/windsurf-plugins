# Machine-local documentation

Offline doc mirrors for tools installed here, pinned to installed versions: `/etc/claude-code/resources/{claude-code,hyprland,janet,nix,nixos,noctalia}/`

Prefer these over fetching docs. Never Read a whole page or index under `resources/`: `rg -n` first, then Read with offset/limit. For claude-code, `INDEX.short.txt` (path + title) is the TOC; `INDEX.txt` is for grep only. Read `resources/README.md` for per-tree version fidelity and caveats.
