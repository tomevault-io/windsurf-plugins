# Virustotal — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `virustotal-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install virustotal --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `virustotal-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is on `$PATH`.

If the `npx` install fails before this CLI has a public-library category, install Node or use the category-specific Go fallback after publish.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the install step did not put the binary on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Malware analysis and threat intelligence platform

## Command Reference

**domains** — Manage domains

- `virustotal-pp-cli domains <domain>` — Retrieve information about a domain

**files** — Manage files

- `virustotal-pp-cli files get` — Retrieve scan results for a file hash
- `virustotal-pp-cli files scan` — Submit a file for scanning

**ip-addresses** — Manage ip addresses

- `virustotal-pp-cli ip-addresses <ip>` — Retrieve information about an IP address

**urls** — Manage urls

- `virustotal-pp-cli urls get` — Retrieve scan results for a URL
- `virustotal-pp-cli urls scan` — Submit a URL for scanning

**virustotal-search** — Manage virustotal search

- `virustotal-pp-cli virustotal-search` — Search using VirusTotal query syntax


### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
virustotal-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Auth Setup
Set your API key via environment variable:

```bash
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="<your-key>"
```

Or persist it in `~/.config/virustotal-pp-cli/config.toml`.

Run `virustotal-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  virustotal-pp-cli domains mock-value --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
virustotal-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
virustotal-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
virustotal-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.virustotal-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `VIRUSTOTAL_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `VIRUSTOTAL_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
virustotal-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
virustotal-pp-cli --profile briefing domains mock-value
virustotal-pp-cli profile list --json
virustotal-pp-cli profile show briefing
virustotal-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```
