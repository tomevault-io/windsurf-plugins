# COPILOT GUIDELINES

## PRIMARY DIRECTIVE

    Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
    Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
    Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

    1.  ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
    2.  Your plan MUST include:
        - All functions/sections that need modification
        - The order in which changes should be applied
        - Dependencies between changes
        - Estimated number of separate edits required 3. Format your plan as:
    3.  Format your plan as:

## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN

    Working with: [filename]
    Total planned edits: [number]

### MAKING EDITS

    - Focus on one conceptual change at a time
    - Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
    - Include concise explanations of what changed and why
    - Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style
    - Make sure the edit does not introduce logic where it should not be

### EXECUTION PHASE

    - After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress: "✅ Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
    - If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
    - STOP and update the plan
    - Get approval before continuing

### REFACTORING GUIDANCE

    When refactoring large files:
    - Break work into logical, independently functional chunks and files
    - Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
    - Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
    - Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied

### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE

    - For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
    - Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
    - Always provide clear stopping points

## General Requirements

    Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.

## Security Considerations

    - Sanitize all user inputs thoroughly.
    - Parameterize database queries.
    - Enforce strong Content Security Policies (CSP).
    - Use CSRF protection where applicable.
    - Ensure secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`).
    - Limit privileges and enforce role-based access control.
    - Implement detailed internal logging and monitoring.
