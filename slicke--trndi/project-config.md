# AGENTS.md

## Scope
This file applies to the Trndi repository root and its subdirectories.

## Working Rules
- Prefer the project Makefile instead of calling `lazbuild` directly.
- On Linux and macOS, use `make` targets for build and test workflows.
- On Windows, use `make.ps1` for the same workflows when available.
- When a task needs a build or test command, prefer the smallest relevant target such as `make`, `make debug`, `make test`, or `make test-noserver`.
- Use `make noext` when you need a build path that avoids the QuickJS engine.
- Check `make help` before inventing a new command or target.

## Branching & Pull Requests
- Always branch from `develop` and open PRs targeting `develop`, not `main`.

## Editing Guidance
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Preserve existing Pascal style and project layout. Formatting should adhere to the rules in `JCFSettings.xml`.
- Unit files must use the `.pp` extension.
- For cross-platform code, add platform-specific logic to `units/trndi/trndi.native.win.pp`, `trndi.native.linux.pp`, or `trndi.native.mac.pp`. Do not add `{$IFDEF}` platform blocks to `trndi.native.base`.
- Note the architectural pattern of breaking out code from large units (like `umain`) into `.inc` (include) files. Follow this pattern to keep main unit files manageable.
- Avoid unrelated refactors or formatting-only edits.
- Update documentation when behavior or workflow changes.
- When behavior changes, update the relevant user-facing docs too, such as README.md, MANUAL.md, or guides/.
- Avoid editing generated outputs or build artifacts unless you are intentionally regenerating them.
- Follow the repo documentation standard in CONTRIBUTING.md: use PasDoc comments for public APIs in interfaces and banner-style comments in implementations.
- All files must include the standard Trndi header (GPLv3 license and Medical Disclaimer), **except the `slicke.*` units** — see the carve-out below. When creating or modifying a file without a header, ensure the following is present at the top:
  ```pascal

- **Exception — `slicke.*` units are Apache-2.0.** The reusable `slicke` toolkit (`units/slicke/**` and its `tests/mock/slicke.*` stubs) is licensed Apache License 2.0, not GPLv3, so it can be reused outside Trndi (Apache-2.0 is one-way compatible into Trndi's GPLv3). These units use a compact header instead of the block above — do **not** add the GPLv3 header or Medical Disclaimer to them:
  ```pascal
  (*
   * <unit>.pas
   * <one-line description>
   * Copyright (c) Björn Lindh
   * GitHub: https://github.com/slicke/trndi
   * License: Apache License 2.0
   *)
  ```

## Validation
- After code changes, run the narrowest relevant build or test target first.
- Prefer `make test-noserver` for a quick local check when the embedded test server is not needed.
- Do not widen validation beyond the touched area unless the first check fails or the change reaches adjacent build/test surfaces.
- If a change touches build behavior, verify with the matching `make` target before widening scope.
