# Project Guidelines

## Build and Test
- Install dependencies: npm ci
- Build package and CLI bundle: npm run build
- Build subpackage: npm -w packages/dns-checks run build
- Run local Worker dev server: npx wrangler dev
- Run tests (Workers runtime): npm test
- Run subpackage tests: npm -w packages/dns-checks run test
- Run single test file: npx vitest run test/check-spf.spec.ts
- Run chaos test (all 9 MCP client types): python3 scripts/chaos/chaos-test-clients.py
- Typecheck: npm run typecheck
- Typecheck subpackage: npm -w packages/dns-checks run typecheck
- Lint: npm run lint
- Auto-fix lint issues: npm run lint:fix
- Enable pre-commit hooks: git config core.hooksPath .githooks
- Deploy production worker config: npm run deploy:prod

## Runtime and Code Style
- Target Cloudflare Workers APIs only. Do not use Node-only APIs in runtime code.
- Keep TypeScript strict and preserve existing module/isolatedModules patterns.
- WASM Policy Engine: Integrated `bv-wasm-core` for high-performance, tamper-resistant permission checks and token estimation.
- For findings/results, use createFinding() and buildCheckResult() from src/lib/scoring.ts rather than manual object construction.
- Validate and normalize all domain input with validateDomain() and sanitizeDomain() from src/lib/sanitize.ts.
- Keep changes minimal and avoid unrelated refactors.

## Architecture
- HTTP entrypoint and middleware: src/index.ts
- Internal service binding routes: src/internal.ts
- Shared MCP execution flow: src/mcp/execute.ts and src/mcp/dispatch.ts
- Tool handlers: src/handlers/tools.ts. Tool schema definitions: src/schemas/tool-definitions.ts
- Individual DNS checks: src/tools/check-*.ts
- Parallel orchestration and scoring output: src/tools/scan-domain.ts
- Core DNS/cache/session/rate-limit utilities: src/lib/
- Monorepo structure: Root Cloudflare Worker + packages/dns-checks runtime-agnostic subpackage

## Project Conventions
- Keep versions synchronized between package.json version and src/lib/server-version.ts SERVER_VERSION.
- Error messages intended for clients must start with safe prefixes (for example: Missing required, Invalid, Domain validation failed, Resource not found).
- Rate limiting for MCP should return HTTP 200 with JSON-RPC error code -32029; `retry-after` may still be set.
- Respect output format behavior:
  - format=compact for interactive clients
  - format=full for non-interactive clients
- scan is a supported alias for scan_domain.

## Caching and Performance
- Per-check cache key pattern: cache:<domain>:check:<name>
- Scan-level cache key pattern: cache:<domain>
- Profile cache key pattern: cache:<domain>:profile:<profile>
- For force_refresh flows, propagate skipCache through runWithCache().

## Testing Patterns
- Use test/helpers/dns-mock.ts utilities for DNS mocking.
- Restore fetch mocks in afterEach.
- In tests that need mock isolation for check_mx, use dynamic imports inside test bodies.
- Clear both scan-level and per-check cache entries between relevant test cases.
- Chaos testing: Run `python3 scripts/chaos/chaos-test-clients.py` to validate behavior across all 9 MCP client types.

## Security and Internal Routes
- Keep SSRF protections and domain sanitization paths intact.
- Public traffic must not access /internal/* routes.
- Do not expose secrets in code, logs, or committed files.
- Do not hardcode API keys in scripts or client config examples; load from environment variables (for example `BV_API_KEY`).

## Documentation Map (Link, Do Not Duplicate)

- User-facing overview and quick start: README.md
- Contributor workflow and expectations: CONTRIBUTING.md
- Client setup and transport details: docs/client-setup.md
- Scoring model details: docs/scoring.md
- Tenant operations notes: docs/tenant-ops-runbook.md and docs/provisioning/brand-audit-bindings.md
- Troubleshooting guide: docs/troubleshooting.md
- Security policy and disclosure process: SECURITY.md
