# Repository expectations

## Bootstrap

- If the user asks to install, enable, deploy, bootstrap, or set up this predictive KB system on any machine, your default first action is to run `python scripts/install_codex_kb.py --json` from the repository root.
- Immediately after installation, run `python scripts/install_codex_kb.py --check --json` and confirm the install is healthy before doing anything else.
- Treat the installer as idempotent. If the system may already be installed, rerun the installer anyway rather than asking the user to verify it manually.
- If this repository was moved to a new path or re-cloned, rerun the installer from the new clone so the Codex-side manifest points at the current KB root.
- The installed global preflight skill must enable implicit invocation, remind Codex to add phase-change KB checkpoints during long mixed tasks, and remind Codex to record KB postflight observations after meaningful work, including skill/plugin and subagent/delegation usage lessons when they materially affect task outcomes. Treat missing behavior as an installation defect and fix it.
- The installer must also refresh the repository-managed `kb-sleep-maintenance`, `kb-dream-pass`, `kb-architect-pass`, `kb-organization-contribute`, `kb-organization-maintenance`, and `khaos-brain-update` skills under `$CODEX_HOME/skills`; these skills are explicit maintenance, organization, or update entry points and should not enable broad implicit invocation.
- The installer must also refresh the repository-managed `KB Sleep`, `KB Dream`, and `KB Architect` cron automations under `$CODEX_HOME/automations` so another machine inherits the same maintenance cadence after bootstrap; these automations should use the strongest available model and deepest reasoning policy instead of pinning a fixed model slug.
- The installer must also write or refresh a repository-managed global defaults block under `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` so other machines inherit the strongest available session-wide KB preflight and postflight rules, not only the implicit skill layer.
- The install check must expose a structured machine-install checklist that explicitly verifies the global skill files, implicit invocation, phase-change KB checkpoint wording, postflight reminder wording, mistake-first highest-priority postflight wording, skill/plugin and subagent/delegation signal wording, managed global AGENTS block, repo-managed maintenance/organization/update skills, all repo-managed automations, and the final `strong_session_defaults` readiness signal.

## Start here

- Read `PROJECT_SPEC.md` before making architectural changes.
- Treat `PROJECT_SPEC.md` as the authoritative v0.1 design brief.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` short; put detailed design rationale in `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.

## Purpose

This repository stores a local predictive knowledge library that Codex can consult before solving tasks.

## GitHub publish default

- When the user asks to update or sync GitHub for this repository, default to a **release audit** first, not to an automatic version bump.
- Inspect `VERSION`, visible README versioning, git tags, GitHub Release state, and the commit currently targeted by the latest tag together before publishing.
- Only create a new version when there is a **release-worthy public delta** since the last tagged commit. Do not mint a new version for history-only KB changes, private-card churn, release-note wording edits, or other same-commit repair work.
- If an existing tag or Release already points at the intended source commit, repair or reuse that release state instead of creating another version number for the same commit.
- Create the release commit first, then create the tag, then verify the tag target, then push branch and tag, then create or update the GitHub Release. Do not create the commit and tag in parallel.
- Do not move an existing tag unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Keep detailed release rules in `docs/release_policy.md`.

## How to use the library

- Run `python scripts/install_codex_kb.py` once per machine to install the global Codex preflight skill and launcher.
- When the task is machine setup for this system, do not wait for extra confirmation or extra explanation. Run the installer and check commands as the default bootstrap path.
- When a task may depend on user preference, recurring workflow, domain heuristics, or prior lessons, invoke `$local-kb-retrieve` first.
- For long mixed tasks, rerun retrieval at phase-change KB checkpoints before substantially different work begins, such as switching from analysis to code edits, packaging, privacy-sensitive handling, organization-KB work, automation changes, GitHub push/tag/release, or public publication. Do not rerun retrieval for repeated same-type subtasks.
- Infer a primary conceptual route before retrieval. Do not rely on flat keywords alone when a route is apparent.
- Treat KB entries as bounded context, not unquestionable truth.
- Prefer entries with `status: trusted`.
- If an entry conflicts with direct user instructions in the current conversation, follow the current user instruction.
