# AGENTS

Guidance for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, …) working in this repository.
This file holds only the **mandatory** knowledge. Everything else lives
in `docs/` — read the matching doc before working in an area.

## Project Overview

DecBench is a benchmarking suite for evaluating decompiler performance. It
implements a three-stage pipeline (compile → decompile → evaluate) with
pluggable decompilers and three core metrics, and publishes the results as a
static site (https://decbench.com). The associated data produced from this
benchmark can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/noelo-lab/decbench-dataset.

## Docs index

| Doc | Read it before |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/benchmarking.md` | running anything at scale — this machine's decompiler installs + versions, the corpus (sailr/cps/malware), the run drivers + env knobs, and the overlay → finalize flow behind the published numbers |
| `docs/metrics.md` | touching a metric — GED / type_match / byte_match internals, fairness passes, metric caching |
| `docs/decompilers.md` | adding or debugging a backend — the plugin contract, the LLM/coding-agent backends, external submissions (the eval kit) |
| `docs/site.md` | touching the report or site — rendering architecture, the content system, build/deploy, the data schema |
| `docs/dataset-publishing.md` | publishing to / consuming the HuggingFace dataset repo |

## Environment

- Use the `decbench` virtualenv at `/home/mahaloz/.virtualenvs/decbench`
  (Python 3.14; decbench installed editable). Activate with
  `source /home/mahaloz/.virtualenvs/decbench/bin/activate`.
- Benchmark backends working on this machine: angr, ghidra (12.1/12.0 + three
  historical versions), ida (9.2 idalib), binja (5.3), kuna, r2dec, dewolf,
  and the codex/claude-code LLM agents. retdec/reko need their Docker images
  built first, and kimi-code needs a Kimi OAuth login.
  `decbench list-decompilers` shows live availability; install paths,
  licenses, and per-version config are in `docs/benchmarking.md`.
- Docker works here (no sudo needed).

## Common Commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"             # install for development
pytest                              # all tests, with coverage (real-decompiler tests auto-skip)
ruff check .                        # lint
black .                             # format
mypy decbench                       # type check

decbench run project.toml -O O0 -O O2 -d angr -d ghidra   # full pipeline, one project
decbench list-decompilers           # show available decompilers
decbench list-metrics               # show available metrics
decbench report scoreboard.toml     # render the HTML report
decbench site build results/full_run -o site/   # build the deployable Pages tree
```

Real benchmark runs use `scripts/compile_all.py` + `scripts/run_benchmark.py`
(checkpointed, resumable, spawn-based) — NOT a bare `decbench run`. A "full
run" always means every project in `projects/{sailr,cps,malware}/` × every
supported decompiler. Drivers, env knobs, and the full-run recipe:
`docs/benchmarking.md`.

## Architecture

```
decbench/
  pipeline/         # compile -> decompile -> evaluate (executor.py / PipelineExecutor)
  metrics/          # ged.py, type_match.py, byte_match.py, fixup.py
  decompilers/      # raw angr/ghidra/ida/binja + dewolf, dockerized, LLM agents
  compilers/        # gcc plugin
  models/           # Pydantic data models (project.py, function_data.py, ...)
  scoring/          # aggregation, scoreboard, dataset presets, report extras
  rendering/        # the report + the deployable site (see docs/site.md)
    content/        #   ALL editable prose/config; html.py is skeleton-only
  utils/            # binfmt.py, cfg.py, source_extract.py
  cli.py            # Click-based CLI entry point
scripts/            # scalable run drivers + offline metric re-eval/rebuild
projects/           # benchmark corpus TOMLs: sailr/ cps/ malware/
site/               # the built Pages tree (committed; CI only deploys it)
docs/               # the detailed reference docs (index above)
```

Data flow: project TOML → compile (binaries + preprocessed `.i` files) →
decompile (`DecompilationResult` per binary) → metrics (`MetricResult`) →
aggregate → `scoreboard.toml` + `function_results.json` → report / site.

Key conventions:

- **Decompiler identity is `name` or `name@version`** (e.g. `ghidra@12.1`);
  each versioned spec is its own comparable column everywhere downstream.
- **Addresses are stored in ELF-file-space** so they line up with DWARF.
- **Optimization levels map to GCC flags via `opt_gcc_flags()`**
  (`decbench/models/project.py`) — never `f"-{opt}"`. `O2-noinline` =
  `-O2 -fno-inline`; plain `O2` is a genuine O2 (inlining enabled).

## Critical rules (violating these silently corrupts results)

- **The published metric numbers are the reeval OVERLAYS**, not the checkpoint
  inline values. `function_results.json` is only ever written through
  `decbench/results_store.py`; the canonical rebuild is
  `scripts/finalize_results.py <tree>` (coverage-guarded; `--audit` scans for
  silent gaps). After adding a decompiler, refresh the overlays and
  re-finalize before publishing. Full flow: `docs/benchmarking.md`.
