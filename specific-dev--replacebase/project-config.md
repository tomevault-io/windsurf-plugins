# Replacebase

## Context

Replacebase is a TypeScript library that serves as a drop-in replacement for Supabase's backend. Users plug it into their own server (Express, Hono, etc.), point their existing `@supabase/supabase-js` client at it, and everything keeps working. This enables gradual migration away from Supabase's managed platform.

Two Supabase services are replicated:

- **REST API** (`/rest/v1/*`) — PostgREST-compatible CRUD, derived from Drizzle schemas
- **Auth** (`/auth/v1/*`) — GoTrue-compatible auth API, using Better Auth internally

Key constraints: framework-agnostic (Hono internally, Web Standard `fetch` handler exported), RLS enforced at Postgres level, no schema changes required to existing Supabase database (only additive tables/columns), only `jwtSecret` needed in config (API keys validated from client requests).

---

## Architecture

```
@supabase/supabase-js client
  │
  │  HTTP (apikey + Authorization headers)
  │
Replacebase (Hono router)
  ├── API key middleware (validates JWTs via jwtSecret)
  ├── /rest/v1/* (PostgREST-compatible)
  │     Parse query params → Drizzle query → SET ROLE + set_config → execute
  └── /auth/v1/* (GoTrue-compatible)
        Translate requests → Better Auth auth.api.* → issue Supabase-compatible JWTs
  │
PostgreSQL (same DB, untouched schema + a few additive tables)
```

## File Structure

```

## Key Design Decisions

### API Key Validation (no keys in config)

The backend only needs `jwtSecret`. The Supabase client sends the anon key as both `apikey` and `Authorization` headers. Both are JWTs signed with the same secret. The middleware:

1. Verifies `apikey` header as JWT → extracts `role` claim (`anon` or `service_role`)
2. Checks if `Authorization` header contains a different JWT (user session token)
3. If yes, verifies it → role becomes `authenticated`, extracts `sub` as user ID
4. If no, uses the apikey's role

A `generateKeys(jwtSecret)` utility generates anon + service_role key JWTs for users during setup.

### Better Auth Integration

**Challenge:** Better Auth's schema differs fundamentally from Supabase's (passwords in `account` vs `auth.users.encrypted_password`, `emailVerified` boolean vs `email_confirmed_at` timestamp, cookie sessions vs JWT + refresh tokens).

**Approach:**

1. **Better Auth uses `auth.users`** as its user table, with 3 added nullable columns (`name`, `email_verified`, `image`). These are additive, non-breaking changes.
2. **Better Auth gets new tables** in the `auth` schema: `accounts`, `ba_sessions`, `verifications`. These don't conflict with existing Supabase tables.
3. **Password hashing** configured for bcrypt (matching Supabase's format).
4. **GoTrue-compatible endpoints** call `auth.api.*` internally — Better Auth's own HTTP endpoints are never exposed.
5. **JWT issuance** handled by us using `jose` with HS256 and exact Supabase claim structure (`sub`, `role`, `aal`, `session_id`, `app_metadata`, `user_metadata`, etc.).
6. **Refresh tokens** managed by us in `auth.refresh_tokens` (Supabase's existing table), with rotation and revocation chain tracking.
7. **Better Auth's cookie sessions** are a side effect that we ignore — our JWT-based auth is authoritative.
