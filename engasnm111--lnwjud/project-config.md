# Repository agent instructions

## Automatic scheduled continuation

When a user-authorized repository task is still incomplete and the user has authorized scheduled continuation, load and follow [`.agents/skills/lnwjud-scheduled-continuation/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/lnwjud-scheduled-continuation/SKILL.md) as the source of truth. Never create a schedule when the user has explicitly opted out for the current task.

For rolling continuation, the workspace skill is authoritative. Current mainline uses exactly one **hourly recurring** Native ChatGPT Scheduled Task for an active goal, in the current chat with cloud execution requested. Ordinary checkpoints and ordinary recurring wakes reuse the same native task; they do not create or retime a per-turn successor. Historical one-time watchdog rows are compatibility-only. Never use lnwjud `scheduler`, Windows Task Scheduler, `schtasks.exe`, cron, shell timers, browser/DOM automation, or undocumented scheduler APIs as a fallback. Never create or re-enable scheduled continuation when the user has explicitly disabled it for the current task.

Every rolling-mode workspace mutation must use the current `goalLease` token/generation proof. Same MCP session identity is not ownership proof. Track background work with goal-relative `trackedTasks`: `blocking_job` entries participate in liveness, while `supporting_service` entries do not; explicit `provider` routing and `cancelWithGoal` ownership prevent a shared service from being probed or stopped accidentally. Legacy `activeTaskIds` rows decode conservatively as goal-owned blocking jobs. Live or unknown liveness fails closed; stale-owner takeover must follow the bounded recovery rules in the scheduled-continuation skill. A request to disable scheduling stops only scheduled continuation and never abandons the durable goal. When the goal finishes, make the exact Native ChatGPT task non-runnable using the strongest operation actually exposed by the host (prefer true delete, otherwise host-confirmed disable), record truthful cleanup evidence, finish the goal, verify `get_goal` is terminal, and stop. Never report completion while the goal is active.

## Durable checkpoint fidelity

A milestone checkpoint is durable reconstruction state, not a status blurb. For meaningful milestones and every handoff boundary, populate `resumeContext` with enough concrete state for a new worker to continue without guessing or repeating settled work: changed files, exact commands/results, decisions, failed attempts, pending validation, resume prerequisites, state facts, and artifacts. Keep blockers, tracked tasks, step status and next action truthful and current. `summary` is only a headline; never rely on summary text alone when detailed recovery facts exist. `session_handoff` must prefer durable goal + checkpoint resume context before Git diff or legacy trackers.

## Authoritative CI Watcher Policy

When a GitHub Actions workflow must be monitored until completion, use one authoritative long-running background/durable watcher for the exact workflow run instead of repeated ad-hoc polling.

- Resolve and record the exact GitHub Actions run ID first. Never monitor only "the latest run on a branch" after the watcher starts.
- Before starting a watcher, inspect existing authoritative shell/process tasks. If a live watcher already targets the same exact run ID, reuse its task ID and inspect/wait/result it; do not start a duplicate watcher.
- Preferred watcher command: `gh run watch <RUN_ID> -i 20 --exit-status`.
- Treat the watcher task as the authoritative task for that CI run and keep it attached to the durable goal as a `blocking_job` when goal tracking is active.
- Do not report CI success until the authoritative watcher is terminal and the GitHub workflow conclusion is confirmed.
- On failure, inspect the actual GitHub Actions job logs for that exact run before changing code. Do not guess from branch state or from a different run.
- Never merge, tag, publish, or release from a SHA whose required CI run failed or is still non-terminal.
- Multiple exact workflow run IDs may be chained inside one durable watcher process when appropriate, but preserve each workflow's exit code and fail the watcher if any required workflow fails.
- A CI watcher is process monitoring, not a ChatGPT Scheduled Task. Do not create or re-enable scheduled continuation merely to watch CI when the user has scheduling disabled.
- Windows example only:

  ```powershell
  powershell -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command "
  Write-Host 'Watching CI run 123456...';
  gh run watch 123456 -i 20 --exit-status;
  $ciExit = $LASTEXITCODE;
  exit $ciExit
  "
  ```

- macOS/Linux must use a shell available on that platform (for example `sh`/`bash`) rather than assuming PowerShell is installed:

  ```sh
  gh run watch 123456 -i 20 --exit-status
  ```
