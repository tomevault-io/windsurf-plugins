# Lens Studio scene edits

Do **not** write or edit `lens-studio/Assets/Scene.scene` (or other `.scene` files) directly.

Use the **`user-lens-studio` MCP tools** for all scene-object investigation and manipulation (create/move/rename objects, wire components, inspect hierarchy).

Raw scene-file edits are not allowed. If the MCP cannot express a change, stop and ask the user rather than patching `Scene.scene` by hand.
