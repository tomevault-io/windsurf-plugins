description: Run local CI before any agent git commit

# Pre-commit CI gate

Before creating any git commit, the agent **must** run the local CI script from the
repo root and confirm it passes:

```bash
./launcher/scripts/run-ci.sh
```

This reproduces GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): dimos-ar (ruff, mypy,
pytest) and lens-studio-tests (Vitest).

## Workflow

1. Finish the code changes.
2. Run `./launcher/scripts/run-ci.sh` from the repository root.
3. If it fails, fix the failures and re-run until it passes.
4. Only then stage and commit.

## Exceptions

- Do **not** commit if CI is still failing unless the user explicitly asks to commit
  anyway (e.g. WIP, CI fix in progress).
- If the user only asked for a commit of files that cannot affect CI (e.g. docs-only),
  still run CI unless the user explicitly waives the check.

## Notes

- Run from repo root: `spectacles-dimensional-os/`, not `dimos-ar/` or `lens-studio/`.
- Optional env vars: `CI_PYTHON`, `CI_VENV` (see script header).
- CI may take several minutes; wait for completion before committing.
- **Must run outside the Cursor agent sandbox.** DimOS logging writes under
  `~/.local/state/dimos/logs/`; a sandboxed run fails collection with
  `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted`. Request unrestricted /
  `all` permissions (or run the script in a normal terminal) — do not treat a
  sandbox permission failure as a test failure.
