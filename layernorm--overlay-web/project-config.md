# Agent memory (continual learning)

## Learned User Preferences

- Prefer plain-language explanations for security, auth, and billing setup—not only code or env var names.
- When debugging integrations (Convex, WorkOS, Stripe), use concrete error logs or network responses early so fixes match the actual failure mode.
- For Convex changes that affect the running app, push to **both** deployments after editing `convex/`: run `npm run convex:push:all` (or `convex:push:prod` then `convex:push:dev`). Do **not** pass `.env.local` to `convex deploy` — that file usually sets `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` to the **dev** slug, which makes `deploy` hit the wrong API and return `MissingAccessToken`; use plain `convex deploy -y` / `npm run convex:push:prod` for production. Use `convex:push:dev` (`.env.development.local`) for the dev backend.
- For local web work against the dev Convex backend, prefer `npm run dev:with-convex` so the dev deployment is pushed before `next dev` starts.
- For UI work, align new controls with the existing app chrome and design language. Dark mode should use dark gray surfaces/buttons with light text—not full-white cards or full-black CTAs. Use Lucide icons, not emoji or decorative icon sets. The user's aesthetic bar is very high — first-pass designs have been rejected repeatedly as "hideous"; default to the simplest, cleanest possible implementation and validate visually before considering it done.
- Run deploys, tests, and shell workflows in the environment when possible instead of only describing steps. After substantial implementation work (especially architecture phases), include a brief QA checklist: commands to run, routes to hit, and what should look normal.
- For billing or Stripe webhook testing, run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`.
- For verification, run the smallest check that covers the change. In this repo, targeted ESLint on changed files is acceptable when full `npm run lint` is blocked by unrelated generated or mobile issues.
- Model dropdowns: order by intelligence/quality (`CHAT_MODEL_QUALITY_PRIORITY`), not provider grouping or alphabetical order; keep free-tier "Auto" at the top. Capability badges are small chips (`inline-flex w-4 h-4 rounded bg-[#f0f0f0]`) with thin Lucide icons (`ScanEye` vision, `Sparkles` reasoning)—only when the model supports the capability. Reveal secondary info (e.g. cost) on row hover via `group/row` + `group-hover/row:hidden` / `hidden group-hover/row:flex`.
- Streaming text must render in complete, markdown-formatted chunks without per-character diffs that cause visible flickering. Agent loading should use bottom-placed dots, not parallel "Thinking..." text. Tool-call/action UIs should be minimal, collapsed, and sequential by default.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- This Next.js app selects Convex URL from env: development commonly uses `DEV_NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` for a separate dev backend from production `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`.
- Session state uses httpOnly `overlay_session` with the WorkOS access token inside the signed payload. WorkOS access tokens are JWTs; Convex verifies them with JWKS and issuer/audience checks—`iss` is a claim inside the token, not a separate secret or cookie name.
- App code is layered: `src/features/<domain>/`, `src/components/{ui,layout,providers}/`, `src/server/` (server-only), and `src/shared/` (isomorphic). Reusable contracts and adapters live in workspace `packages/` (`@overlay/app-core`, `@overlay/auth-contracts`, `@overlay/storage-contracts`, `@overlay/llm-gateway`, `@overlay/agent-runtime`, `@overlay/tools-core`, `@overlay/api-client`, etc.). `@overlay/api-client` is split into per-resource modules under `packages/overlay-api-client/src/`. Legacy `src/lib/` is gone. tsconfig aliases: `@/server/*`, `@/shared/*`, `@/features/*`.
- Phased refactor scope is tracked in `.windsurf/plans/overlay-architecture-plan-6a2040.md` (chat decomposition, `@overlay/*` package extraction, API portability).
- `convex/` must import `@/shared/*`, never `@/server/*` — server modules use `server-only` and break Convex bundling. Shared modules used by Convex include `storage/storage-keys`, `ai/sandbox/daytona-pricing`, and `ai/gateway/model-pricing`.
- Convex handlers are grouped by domain folder (`convex/chat/conversations.ts` → `chat/conversations:*`, `convex/files/files.ts` → `files/files:*`, `convex/platform/usage.ts` → `platform/usage:*`, etc.). BFF routes use those string paths; typed code uses nested `api` / `internal` from `_generated/api` (e.g. `api.chat.conversations`, `internal.knowledge.memoryExtractorNode`). Do not re-export multiple modules from one `index.ts` barrel — it collides on export names and can pull `"use node"` code into the default runtime.
- `src/shared/` is isomorphic: no Node builtins, no ad-hoc `process.env` (use `@/shared/env/public-env`), no `@/server/*`, no `'use client'` modules. Verify with `npm run check:shared-isomorphic`.
- ESLint layer boundaries live in `scripts/eslint-boundary-rules.mjs` (wired from `eslint.config.mjs`); ~38 pre-existing cross-feature and components→features violations are documented tech debt.
