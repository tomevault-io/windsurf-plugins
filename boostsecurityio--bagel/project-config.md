# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Bagel is a cross‑platform CLI that inspects developer workstations (macOS, Linux, Windows) and produces a structured report of:

* Installed **dev tools** and their risky settings (IDEs, language toolchains, package managers, container/K8s tooling, IaC, cloud CLIs, etc.).
* **Secret locations (metadata only)**: presence of tokens/keys/creds in expected files, env vars, keyrings, agents—**never the secret values**.
* **System & shell posture**: PATH hygiene, RC files, agent forwarding, truststores, disabled TLS checks, etc.

## Code Standards

Follow `.golangci.yml` linter configuration strictly - all code must be 100% linter-compliant. Key enforced rules:
- `errcheck` & `wrapcheck`: Proper error handling mandatory
- `govet`: Catches suspicious constructs  
- `staticcheck`: Comprehensive static analysis
- `unused`: No dead code allowed
- `zerologlint`: Structured logging best practices

Never ignore errors - use explicit error handling throughout. Fatal errors only acceptable during application startup.

Always log anything using the zerolog structured logging library.

## Testing

- Unit tests for individual components
- use testify to do assertions and comparisons

### 0 — Purpose
These rules ensure maintainability, safety, and developer velocity.  
**MUST** rules are enforced by CI/review; **SHOULD** rules are strong recommendations; **CAN** rules are allowed without extra approval.

---

### 1 — Before Coding
- **BP-1 (MUST)** Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements.
- **BP-2 (MUST)** Draft and confirm an approach (API shape, data flow, failure modes) before writing code.
- **BP-3 (SHOULD)** When >2 approaches exist, list pros/cons and rationale.
- **BP-4 (SHOULD)** Define testing strategy (unit/integration) and observability signals up front.

---

### 2 — Modules & Dependencies
- **MD-1 (SHOULD)** Prefer stdlib; introduce deps only with clear payoff; track transitive size and licenses.
- **MD-2 (CAN)** Use `govulncheck` for updates.

---

### 3 — Code Style
- **CS-1 (MUST)** Enforce `gofmt`, `go vet`
- **CS-2 (MUST)** Avoid stutter in names: `package kv; type Store` (not `KVStore` in `kv`).
- **CS-3 (SHOULD)** Small interfaces near consumers; prefer composition over inheritance.
- **CS-4 (SHOULD)** Avoid reflection on hot paths; prefer generics when it clarifies and speeds.
- **CS-5 (MUST)** Use input structs for function receiving more than 2 arguments. Input contexts should not get in the input struct.
- **CS-6 (SHOULD)** Declare function input structs before the function consuming them.

---

### 4 — Errors
- **ERR-1 (MUST)** Wrap with `%w` and context: `fmt.Errorf("open %s: %w", p, err)`.
- **ERR-2 (MUST)** Use `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for control flow; no string matching.
- **ERR-3 (SHOULD)** Define sentinel errors in the package; document behavior.
- **ERR-4 (CAN)** Use `context.WithCancelCause` and `context.Cause` for propagating error causes.

---

### 5 — Concurrency
- **CC-1 (MUST)** The **sender** closes channels; receivers never close.
- **CC-2 (MUST)** Tie goroutine lifetime to a `context.Context`; prevent leaks.
- **CC-3 (MUST)** Protect shared state with `sync.Mutex`/`atomic`; no "probably safe" races.
- **CC-4 (SHOULD)** Use `errgroup` for fan‑out work; cancel on first error.
- **CC-5 (CAN)** Prefer buffered channels only with rationale (throughput/back‑pressure).

---

### 6 — Contexts
- **CTX-1 (MUST)** If a function takes in `ctx context.Context` it must be the first parameter; never store ctx in structs.
- **CTX-2 (MUST)** Propagate non‑nil `ctx`; honor `Done`/deadlines/timeouts.
- **CTX-3 (CAN)** Expose `WithX(ctx)` helpers that derive deadlines from config.

---

### 7 — Testing
- **T-1 (MUST)** Table‑driven tests; deterministic and hermetic by default.
- **T-2 (MUST)** Run `-race` in CI; add `t.Cleanup` for teardown.
- **T-3 (SHOULD)** Mark safe tests with `t.Parallel()`.

---

### 8 — Logging & Observability
- **OBS-1 (MUST)** Structured logging (`zerolog`) with levels and consistent fields.
- **OBS-2 (SHOULD)** Correlate logs/metrics/traces via request IDs from context.
- **OBS-3 (CAN)** Provide debug/pprof endpoints guarded by auth or local‑only access.

---

### 9 — Performance
- **PERF-1 (MUST)** Measure before optimizing: `pprof`, `go test -bench`, `benchstat`.
- **PERF-2 (SHOULD)** Avoid allocations on hot paths; reuse buffers with care; prefer `bytes`/`strings` APIs.
- **PERF-3 (CAN)** Add microbenchmarks for critical functions and track regressions in CI.

---

### 10 — Configuration
- **CFG-1 (MUST)** Config via env/flags; validate on startup; fail fast.
- **CFG-2 (MUST)** Treat config as immutable after init; pass explicitly (not via globals).
- **CFG-3 (SHOULD)** Provide sane defaults and clear docs.
- **CFG-4 (CAN)** Support config hot‑reload only when correctness is preserved and tested.

---

### 11 — APIs & Boundaries
- **API-1 (MUST)** Document exported items: `// Foo does …`; keep exported surface minimal.
- **API-2 (MUST)** Accept interfaces where variation is needed; **return concrete types** unless abstraction is required.
