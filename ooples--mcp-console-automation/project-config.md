# Claude Development Guidelines

## Project Information
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ooples/console-automation-mcp
- **Description**: Console Automation MCP - A tool for managing console sessions with SSH support
- **Important**: This is the ooples/console-automation-mcp project (formerly mcp-console-automation)

## Important Rules

### Code Organization and Improvements

1. **NO SEPARATE "IMPROVED" VERSIONS**: When making enhancements or fixes:
   - Always modify the original file or class directly
   - Do NOT create separate "Improved", "Enhanced", "Fixed" or similar versions
   - Maintain a single source of truth for each component
   - If significant changes are needed, refactor the existing code instead of duplicating

2. **Version Management**:
   - Use version control (git) for tracking changes, not file duplication
   - Keep the codebase clean and maintainable with single implementations
   - Document major changes in comments or commit messages, not separate files

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Always run lint and typecheck commands after making changes
   - Test changes thoroughly before considering work complete
   - Run: `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` (or equivalent commands)
