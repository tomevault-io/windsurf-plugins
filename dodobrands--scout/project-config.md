# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to LLM when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Scout is a Swift-based code analysis toolkit for mobile repositories. It provides executable tools for counting types, files, imports, and lines of code across git history.

## Build Commands

```bash
swift build                           # Build all targets
swift build --build-tests             # Build including tests
swift build --product CountTypes      # Build specific executable
swift run CountTypes [args]           # Run executable directly
```

## Testing

Uses Swift Testing framework with `@Test` macros. Tests are in `Tests/CodeReaderTests/`.

```bash
swift test                            # Build and run tests
swift test --skip-build               # Run tests (after build)
```

## Linting and Formatting

Uses Swift Format with configuration in `.swift-format.json`.

```bash
sh scripts/lint.sh                    # Lint with --strict
sh scripts/format.sh                  # Auto-format in place
```

## Documentation

Each module has its own README in `Sources/*/README.md` with API details and configuration formats.

## Branching

Each issue must be solved in a separate branch created from fresh main:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Before creating a PR, run all tests and linter:

```bash
sh scripts/lint.sh
swift test
periphery scan --skip-build --strict
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Update `Sources/*/README.md` if public API changed
- [ ] Update `README.md` output examples if output format changed

**Never force push (`git push --force` or `--force-with-lease`) without explicit user request.**

## Commits

Make a commit after each logical unit of work:

- After completing a task or todo item
- Before switching from coding to validation (linting, testing, static analysis)
- After fixing issues found during validation
- Before switching to documentation updates
- After documentation updates

Each commit should represent a single coherent change that can be understood in isolation.

## Coding Conventions

See @ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed coding conventions, SDK API design patterns, and testing guidelines.

## Documentation Updates

When changing public APIs of any tool, update all relevant READMEs in `Sources/*/README.md`.
When changing output format, also update the corresponding output example in the main `README.md`.

## Issues

When creating issues, use the issue template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Pull Requests

Each issue must be solved in a separate PR. Never combine multiple issues in one PR unless explicitly told otherwise.

When creating PRs, strictly follow the PR template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Ensure all checklist items are completed before submitting.

## Language

All work in this repository must be in English: PR titles, PR descriptions, commit messages, issue titles, issue descriptions, comments, code comments, and documentation.
