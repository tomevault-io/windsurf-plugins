# Python Best Practices

## Project Structure
- Use src-layout with `src/your_package_name/`
- Place tests in `tests/` directory parallel to `src/`
- Keep configuration in `config/` or as environment variables
- Store requirements in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Place static files in `static/` directory
- Use `templates/` for Jinja2 templates

## Code Style
- Follow Black code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions:
  - snake_case for functions and variables
  - PascalCase for classes
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (Black default)
- Use absolute imports over relative imports

## Type Hints
- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Use type hints for variables at their first declaration
- Import types from `typing` module
- Use `Optional[Type]` instead of `Type | None`
- Use `TypeVar` for generic types
- Use `Protocol` for duck typing
- Use `-> None` type hinting for functions with no return value

## Testing
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Use pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Use Polyfactory for generating test data and fixtures where necessary
- Implement consistent fixtures with proper separation of concerns
- Organize fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` directory with logical separation:
  - `tests/fixtures/models/` for model-related fixtures
  - `tests/fixtures/api/` for API-related fixtures
  - `tests/fixtures/data/` for data generation fixtures
  - `tests/fixtures/mocks/` for mock-related fixtures
- Use proper mocking with pytest-mock for external dependencies
- Test all error scenarios and edge cases
- Write detailed test descriptions that explain:
  - What aspect of the functionality is being tested
  - Why this test case is important for reliability
  - What specific behavior or edge case is being validated
  - How the test contributes to overall code quality
- Include comprehensive docstrings in test functions explaining the test's purpose and significance
- Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external state
- Implement proper setup and teardown for test data
- Use parameterized tests for testing multiple scenarios efficiently
- Avoid creating meaningless, redundant or unnecessary testcases or testcases that are already proven correct by a previous testcase
- When you are writing testcases and you need to mock a specific function, do not forget to include `# type: ignore[method-assign]` at the end of the line to tell MyPy that it is safe to do this in the context of testing, however this is ONLY safe in the context of testing related files and fixtures
- Next to each assertion in testing you have to add an appropriate error message that will be displayed if the assertion fails. The error message has to reflext on what went wrong in the assertion

## Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use proper session configuration
- Implement proper logging
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Error Handling
- Create custom exception classes
- Use proper try-except blocks
- Implement proper logging
- Return proper error responses
- Handle edge cases properly
- Use proper error messages

## Documentation
- Use Google-style docstrings with a little bit of twist
- Document all public APIs
- Use proper inline comments that are reflective to the context and hold meaningful information about the 
- If a variable name, a function name or a class name is mentioned in the documentation it should be wrapped in `...` quotations following Markdown standards
- Instead of writing boring flowing text descriptions for function documentation, write it an easy to understand, straight to the point manner
- You are also allowed to use Markdown compatible enumerations in the function or class documentations for easier understanding

A potential good example for the documentation of a `function`:

```python
async def initialize_run(
    self, run_type: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any], existing_run_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> str:
    """Initialize a run with **rich** terminal output.

    Args:
        run_type (str): The type of run that we will use
        metadata (Dict[str, Any]): Dictionary containing relevant metadata to the actual run
        existing_run_id (Optional[str]): Existing run ID for compatibility reasons, but not used in any way

    Returns:
        str: ID of the run that will be generated

    Raises:
        PublisherUnavailableError: If publisher is not available for any reason
    """
    ...
```

Notice that in the example:
- The important parts or words of the textual section of the documentation are **highlighted** following Markdown formatting
- References to other classes are distinguished with `Class` notation
- Every argument is properly typed and is given proper, explanatory description of its role for the function
- Args, Returns, and Raises sections must be provided for each and every function, exception being if there are either no arguments for the function, or it might not raise any error

A potential good example for the documentation of a `class`:

```python
class BugninjaClient:
