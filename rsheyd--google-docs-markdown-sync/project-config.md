# AGENTS.md

## Project guidance

- Prefer atomic paragraph/list range patches; preserve unchanged document
  ranges, and use full rebuild only for changed table structure.
- Keep local-change handling debounced and all sync passes single-flight; use
  bounded exponential backoff for remote errors.
- Keep credentials, OAuth tokens, and machine-specific secrets out of Git.
- Keep tracked sync-location pairing files portable: use relative Markdown paths
  and exclude hashes, revisions, timestamps, and tokens.
- Prefer a standard Markdown AST and explicit, testable Google Docs update
  requests over ad hoc text replacement.
- Update user-facing documentation in the same pass when changing visible sync
  behavior, defaults, supported content, commands, setup, or operational
  workflows. Route formatting semantics to `docs/formatting.md`, setup changes to
  `docs/installation.md`, and commands or service behavior to `docs/operations.md`; keep the
  README summary and links current when the broader product description changes.
- Update this file map whenever durable project files are added or renamed.
- Increase the version for a release containing user-visible changes and record those changes under that exact version in `CHANGELOG.md`; do not use a separate Unreleased section. Mark the newest version heading `Unreleased` until that version appears on the GDMS GitHub Releases page, then replace the marker with the publication date. Consolidate additional changes under the newest unreleased version rather than triggering a new version for every change. Minor documentation, planning, template-copy, test-only, and internal-maintenance changes do not require a version bump unless they accompany a release.
