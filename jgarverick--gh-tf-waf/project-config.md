- All Terraform modules should have unit and integration tests in the `test/` directory and should use the Terratest framework.
- All unit tests should contain regular and edge cases.
- Any Terraform objects that use GitHub Actions or GitHub API GraphQL queries should have a separate template for the GitHub Actions workflow or GraphQL query in the `workflows/` directory.
- All objects under the `pillars/` directory should be composed of objects that allow for configuration of properties relevant to that pillar only, and should be composed of modules that exist in the `./modules` directory.
