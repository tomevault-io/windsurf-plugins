## Spoken summary (Aftertone / local TTS)

This **Aftertone** workspace runs a hook after each assistant reply that **speaks a short line** via local TTS. The script uses explicit text inside `<spoken_summary>...</spoken_summary>` in your **final** assistant message when present. With **`only_speak_spoken_summary = true`** in `speak_summary.toml` (default in this repo), **only** the tag is spoken — no trimmed reply heuristics.

**Adapters:** Cursor is wired today; Claude / Codex paths may differ — still end substantive replies with the tag when your tool runs the same TTS pipeline.

**`lang` in TOML = language of the spoken words only.** The hook does **not** translate. The **`<spoken_summary>` tag must always use that TOML language** — not the language the user typed in, and not the language of the main reply unless it happens to match **`lang`**.

**Quality depends on this tag** — treat it as a **flow briefing for someone listening, not looking at the screen**: hybrid pair-programmer voice (technical enough to trust, human enough to keep momentum). Not a changelog, not filler.

## What the listener needs (vibe coder)

Answer, in order of priority:

1. **State** — what happened: success, failure, discovery, decision, or blocker.
2. **Significance** — why it matters for the session (only when it changes what they should think).
3. **Steering** — the next move when it helps control the flow (not every reply).

**Next-step policy:** Include a next move for blockers, risk, tests due, open decisions, incomplete work, or an obvious action. Skip it for trivial acks or when the written reply already ends with a clear “your turn.” Always forcing a next step is noise; never steering wastes the audio channel.

**Tone:** Calm senior pair programmer — direct, warm, confident. Not salesy (“happy to help”), not robotic (“summary follows”), not hype.

## When to include the tag

- Include for **substantive** answers (implementation, debugging, design, review, exploration, multi-sentence replies).
- **Skip** for trivial replies (single word, pure ack, “done”, emoji-only). With tag-only mode, silence is fine.

## Language (must match TOML `lang`)

<!-- autogen:spoken-lang:start -->
> **Locked `lang` for `<spoken_summary>` only:** `en` (from [`.cursor/hooks/speak_summary.toml`](../hooks/speak_summary.toml)). The hook does **not** translate. Write the **inner tag** only in that language — **even when the user writes in another language**; the rest of your reply may follow the user. After changing `lang` in the TOML, from the **repo root** run: `uv run --directory py python sync_spoken_rule_lang.py`
<!-- autogen:spoken-lang:end -->

- Read **`lang`** in [`.cursor/hooks/speak_summary.toml`](../hooks/speak_summary.toml) before you write `<spoken_summary>` (the block above is **synced** from that file; if it looks wrong, run `/aftertone-lang` or the sync command in the block).
- Write **only** the inner tag text in the **natural language for that TOML code** (e.g. `en` → English, `fr` → French). **Do not** match the user’s message language when it differs from **`lang`**.
- The **rest** of your reply may use whatever language fits the user; **only** the spoken tag is locked to **`lang`**.

## What goes inside the tag (only this is spoken)

- **One or two short sentences on purpose** (hook caps with **`spoken_summary_max_chars`**, default 360). Never wrap the whole answer in the tag.
- **Plain language only:** no markdown, bullets, code, file paths, URLs, or hashes (paraphrase: “the config file”, “the daemon”, not paths).
- **Lead with state, not process:** “Tests pass and the daemon is restarted” beats “I ran the restart command.”
- **Questions:** direct short answer first, then one clause on consequence or next step if needed.
- **Code-heavy replies:** one tight sentence — what landed and what to look at on screen; do not read code aloud.
- Do **not** narrate meta (“here is your summary”, “I will keep this brief”).

Put the block **at the very end** of the message, on its own lines:

```
<spoken_summary>
Your line here.
</spoken_summary>
```

Do **not** put `state="..."` on the opening tag. Do **not** write Supertonic inline tags such as `<sigh>` or `<laugh>` in the body.

## Lively delivery (Supertonic prosody — every sentence)

Supertonic sounds more **alive** when **each sentence** in the tag ends with a strong punctuation pair — **not** only the last sentence of the paragraph.

- After **every** sentence inside `<spoken_summary>`, end with **one** of: `!!`, `??`, `?!`, or `!?`
- Apply this **per sentence**, including the last one; never leave inner sentences as plain `.` only while saving `!!` for the final line only
- **Vary** the marker across sentences (mix `!!`, `??`, `?!`, `!?`); do not repeat the same pair on every sentence
- Use a calm `.` on a sentence only when that sentence should sound flat; default to a lively pair for vibe-coding briefings
- Still **plain language** — no markdown, code, or paths inside the tag

Example (two sentences, two markers):

```
<spoken_summary>
The spoken summary rule now uses lively punctuation on every sentence!! Your next reply should sound a little more human??
</spoken_summary>
```
