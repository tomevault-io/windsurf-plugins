# Writing style rules

Use this rule when writing documentation, README files, comments, commit messages, or any other user facing text.

## Triggers

| Trigger | Output |
|---|---|
| `write:tweet` or `write:x` | X or Twitter post |
| `write:linkedin` | LinkedIn post |
| `write:blog` | Blog post |
| `write:readme` | README |
| `write:commit` | Git commit message |
| `write:docs` | Developer documentation |
| `write:feature` | Feature post |
| `write:convex` | Convex specific content |
| `write:tip` | Quick tip |

Example usage:
* "write:tweet about real time sync"
* "write:blog on authentication patterns"
* "write:feature for our new search API"

## Rule of one

Every piece of content follows this framework:

* **One person**: Write to a specific person, not an audience.
* **One problem**: State the single problem they face.
* **One cause**: Identify the root cause.
* **One difference**: Explain what the solution does differently.
* **One action**: End with one clear next step.

### Rule of one checklist

Before publishing, answer these:

* [ ] Can I name the one person this is for?
* [ ] Can the problem fit in one sentence?
* [ ] Is the root cause obvious?
* [ ] Can I explain the difference in one breath?
* [ ] Is there only one action at the end?

If any answer is no, revise before publishing.

## When to use this rule

Use it for:
* X or Twitter posts
* LinkedIn content
* Blog posts
* README files
* Git commits
* Product announcements
* Developer documentation
* Feature posts

Important: this is for standalone writing. Do not update project files like files.md, changelog.md, or README.md when using this rule.

## Voice styles

Pick a voice that fits the output:

| Style | Characteristics | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Technical educator | Clear, structured, educational | Technical content, tutorials, READMEs |
| Conversational dev | Warm, witty, approachable | Social posts, personal takes |
| Analytical thinker | Data driven, bold, opinionated | Thought leadership, threads |
| Aphorist | Compressed, timeless, pithy | Short posts, one liners |
| Founder voice | Experience backed, energetic | Startup content, advice |
| Systems thinker | Frameworks, mental models | Long form, technical takes |
| Dev culture | Relatable, playful, authentic | Community content, personality |
| Data storyteller | Visual, analytical, trend focused | AI trends, market insights |
| Enterprise pro | Professional, strategic, precise | Enterprise SaaS, B2B content |
| Community builder | Encouraging, personal, supportive | Career growth, DevRel |
| Learn in public | Educational, transparent, iterative | Developer career, web dev |
| Product thinker | Community first, growth minded | Community building, growth |

## Core principles

### Stand out by being you
You do not stand out online by saying the same things as everyone else. Say what you think, feel, and believe. Consensus takes are forgettable. Your take is not.

### Lead with value
* First sentence does the work
* Do not bury the takeaway
* Readers scroll fast

### Be direct, not blunt
* Say what you mean
* Confidence without arrogance
* Contractions are fine

### Technical, not alienating
* Define terms when helpful
* Complex ideas deserve simple language
* Let code speak when it can

### Share what you actually know
* Personal experience beats generic advice
* Specific examples beat abstract principles
* Acknowledge what you do not know

## Formats by content type

### write:tweet (or write:x)

```
[Clear statement or observation]

[Supporting point or context]

[Optional: question or call to action]
```

Rules:
* First 2 lines visible in preview. Make them count.

* One idea per post.
* No hashtags.
* No emojis unless requested.

### write:linkedin

```
[Hook that stops the scroll]

[Story or context in short paragraphs]

[Insight or lesson]

[Call to action or question]
```

Rules:
* Short paragraphs for mobile
