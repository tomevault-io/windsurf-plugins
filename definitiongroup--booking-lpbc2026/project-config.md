## Data Model

### Core Entities
1.  **Companies**: Tenants of the system.
2.  **Profiles**: Users linked to `auth.users`, containing role (`admin` vs `user`) and company association.
3.  **Buildings**: Physical locations owned by companies.
4.  **Floors**: Levels within buildings.
5.  **Rooms**: Bookable entities with capacity and amenities.
6.  **Bookings**: Reservations linking Users and Rooms with time slots and status.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **RLS (Row Level Security)** is enabled on all tables.
- **Policies:**
    - Public read access for Buildings, Floors, and Rooms.
    - Users can see all bookings (to avoid double booking) but only edit their own.
    - Admins can manage all bookings.

## Development

### Commands
- \`npm run dev\`: Start development server
- \`npm run build\`: Build for production
- \`npm run lint\`: Run ESLint

### Key Conventions
- **Styling**: Utility-first with Tailwind.
- **State Management**: Server Components for data fetching where possible; Client Components for interactivity.
- **Database Access**: Direct Supabase calls or Server Actions (implied by typical Next.js 14+ patterns, though `actions` folder exists).

## Current Status
- **Auth**: Implemented via Supabase Middleware.
- **Database**: Schemas defined for core entities.
- **Routing**: Skeleton routes exist for Admin, Bookings, Login, Rooms, Schedule, Settings.

## Admin Guide

### 1. Setup
To enable the Admin backend, you must run the following SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor:
1.  `db/01_auth_triggers.sql`: **Required**. Creates a user profile automatically upon sign-up.
2.  `db/02_admin_policies.sql`: **Required**. Secures the database so only Admins can manage resources.

### 2. Creating an Admin
There is no UI to create the *first* admin. You must promote a user manually:
1.  Sign up in the application.
2.  Open `db/03_promote_admin.sql`.
3.  Replace the email with your email and run the script in Supabase.

### 3. Features
Once promoted, you can access `/admin` to:
- **Dashboard**: Approve or Reject pending bookings.
- **Buildings**: Manage office buildings (`/admin/buildings`).
- **Floors**: Manage floors within buildings (`/admin/floors`).
- **Rooms**: Manage meeting rooms (`/admin/rooms`).
