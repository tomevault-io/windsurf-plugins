# Vepol — Repository Instructions

If you are an AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity CLI / `agy`, or
another CLI-capable agent) reading this
file because you've been asked to install or evolve Vepol on the
user's machine, **the operating manual you need is in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** in this same directory.

If `AGENTS.md` is missing or unreadable in the repo you are
working from: **stop and ask the user.** Do not infer install
steps. The combination of "told to install Vepol" and "no
operating manual present" is a corrupted or partial repo, not
permission to improvise.

That file describes:

- How to set up Vepol cleanly (Phase 1)
- How to personalize it to the specific user (Phase 2)
- How to evolve it with the user across many sessions (Phase 3)
- Common errors and how to handle them
- What you must NOT do during install
- How to contribute findings back upstream

Read it end-to-end before taking any action.

This `CLAUDE.md` exists for Claude Code's convention of looking up
project instructions in `CLAUDE.md`; Codex and Antigravity CLI (`agy`,
launched from this directory with `agy --add-dir "$PWD"`) read
`AGENTS.md` natively. These adapter files point to the same operating
manual so whichever configured agent is acting has the same instructions.

## For human readers

If you are a human reader looking at this file from the GitHub web
UI: this is a cross-reference for AI agents. The product
documentation you want is in:

- [README.md](README.md) — product overview, quickstart
- [docs/what-is-vepol.md](docs/what-is-vepol.md) — long-form
  explanation of what Vepol is and isn't
- [docs/methodology/](docs/methodology/) — the seven core
  disciplines
- [docs/visuals/](docs/visuals/) — visual documentation
