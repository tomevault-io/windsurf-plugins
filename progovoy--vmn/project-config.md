# Codex instructions

When generating commit messages, pull request text, patches, or any code-related output, never include this line:

Co-Authored-By: Codex Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

Omit any Codex co-author trailer unless I explicitly ask for it.

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Splitting tasks
Always split big tasks into separate worktrees and do in parallel.
Each worktree agent should write ~200-300 lines max per file. If writing more, split into additional worktrees.
When finished - always try /simplify on the change.

## Timeout handling
If you see API timeouts, split the current task into smaller parallel worktrees rather than retrying.

## Worktree hygiene
- Never push worktree branches to remote.
- When a worktree agent finishes, immediately remove the worktree (`git worktree remove --force`) and delete its local branch (`git branch -D`).
- Before starting new work, check for and clean up any stale worktrees from previous sessions (`git worktree list`).

## Permissions hygiene
- Do not accumulate one-off permission rules in `.Codex/settings.local.json`.
- Prefer broad wildcards (e.g., `Bash(git:*)`) over specific subcommand rules.
- Keep the allow list under 30 entries.

## Code practices
- Keep functions small and single-purpose; prefer clear names over comments.
- Don't add abstractions, config flags, or error handling for cases that can't happen — match the scope of the change to what was actually asked.
- Reuse existing helpers/patterns in the codebase instead of duplicating logic.
- Keep diffs minimal and focused; don't refactor unrelated code in the same change.
- Run the relevant tests (see Running Tests) before considering a change done.

## Test-driven development (required)
All feature work and bug fixes must follow strict TDD:
1. Write the test first. It must fail for the right reason (red).
2. Write the minimum implementation code needed to make it pass (green). Do not modify the test to make it pass.
3. Refactor implementation code only, keeping tests green.

Rules:
- Never edit a test to force a passing result — if the test seems wrong, stop and ask before touching it.
- Do not write implementation code before its test exists.
- Each new behavior gets a test asserting it before any code implements it.

## Project Overview

vmn is a CLI tool and Python library for automatic semantic versioning. Versions live in git annotated tags — zero lock-in, zero databases.

Key differentiators vs semantic-release/release-please:
- Language-agnostic (not JS-centric)
- Multi-repo dependency tracking with `vmn goto` state recovery
- Microservice topology (root apps with independent service versions)
- 4-segment hotfix versioning (`major.minor.patch.hotfix`)
- Auto-init on first `vmn stamp` — no separate `vmn init` required
- Works offline, with shallow clones, in air-gapped environments

## Development Setup

```sh
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r ./tests/test_requirements.txt
pip install -e ./
vmn --version  # Should see 0.0.0 if installed successfully
```

## Running Tests

Tests require Docker. Run the full test suite:
```sh
./tests/run_pytest.sh
```

Run a specific test:
```sh
./tests/run_pytest.sh --specific_test <test_name>
```

Skip a test:
```sh
./tests/run_pytest.sh --skip_test <test_name>
```

Tests run in parallel (29 workers by default) using pytest-xdist.

### Key Concepts

- **App name**: Identifier for a versioned app (e.g., `my_app` or `root_app/service1`). Cannot contain `-` or start with `/`
- **Root app**: Parent container for microservices, format `root_app/service_name`. Root version is an auto-incrementing integer.
- **Version format**: `major.minor.patch[.hotfix][-prerelease.rcn][+buildmetadata]`
- **Tag format**: `{app_name}_{version}` where `/` in app names becomes `-`

### Data Flow

1. Version info stored in git annotated tag messages as YAML (`vmn_info` + `stamping` sections with changesets)
2. Local state tracked in `.vmn/{app_name}/last_known_app_version.yml`
3. `stamp` command: increments version → writes to backends → commits → tags → pushes

### Configuration

Per-app config in `.vmn/{app_name}/conf.yml`. Key fields:
- `template`: Version display format (e.g., `[{major}][.{minor}]`)
- `conventional_commits`: Auto-detect release mode from commit messages (`fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `BREAKING CHANGE` → major). When enabled, `-r` flag is optional.
- `default_release_mode`: `optional` (--orm behavior) or `strict` (-r behavior) when using conventional_commits
- `changelog.path`: Generate CHANGELOG.md on stamp (requires conventional_commits)
- `github_release.draft`: Create GitHub Release on stamp (requires `gh` CLI + `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- `deps`: External repository dependencies for multi-repo tracking
- `version_backends`: Auto-embed version into package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, or any file via regex/Jinja2
- `policies.whitelist_release_branches`: Restrict which branches can stamp/release
