# PitchDocs — Cursor Rules

You are working on PitchDocs, a Claude Code plugin that generates marketing-quality repository documentation. This is a pure Markdown project with no code runtime.

## Architecture

- **Skills** (16): `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — reference knowledge loaded on-demand
- **Agents** (4): `.claude/agents/*.md` — docs-writer (orchestrator), docs-researcher, docs-reviewer; `agents/docs-freshness.md` — installed per-project by `/pitchdocs:activate`
- **Rules** (3 auto-loaded + 2 installable): `.claude/rules/content-filter.md` (global); `.claude/rules/doc-standards.md`, `.claude/rules/docs-awareness.md` (installed auto-loaded); `rules/doc-standards.md`, `rules/docs-awareness.md` (source templates installed per-project by `/pitchdocs:activate`)
- **Commands** (16): `commands/*.md` — 14 active + 2 stubs redirecting to [ContextDocs](https://github.com/littlebearapps/contextdocs)
- **Hooks** (1 opt-in): `hooks/content-filter-guard.sh` — installed per-project by `/pitchdocs:activate install strict` (Claude Code only)

## Writing Standards

- Australian English (realise, colour, behaviour, licence/license)
- Benefit-driven language: `[Feature] so you can [outcome] — [evidence]` (with optional JTBD job mapping for richer benefits)
- 4-question test on every doc: problem solved? usable? credible? linked?
- Progressive disclosure: non-technical first, technical deeper
- Every feature claim must trace to actual code (file path, function, config)

## File Sync Requirements

When adding skills or commands, update all of:
- `README.md` (commands table, features section)
- `AGENTS.md` (skills table, commands table, if applicable)
- `llms.txt` (file reference with benefit description)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` (component dropdown)

## Upstream Specs

Pinned in `upstream-versions.json`, checked monthly by `.github/workflows/check-upstream.yml`. Do not bump spec versions without verifying the upstream source.

## GEO Optimisation

Structure docs for AI extraction: crisp top-of-page definitions, one topic per H2, descriptive headings with keywords, comparison tables for "X vs Y" queries, concrete statistics with evidence.
