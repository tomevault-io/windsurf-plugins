# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Project: Polislike Reaction Canvas

A real-time collaborative voting canvas built on PartyKit (WebSockets) and React. Participants move their cursor/touch into AGREE/DISAGREE/PASS regions of a canvas; cursor positions are shared live across all connected users.

## Vocabulary — git actions

**"push"** and **"commit"** are equivalent — both mean git commit/push on the current branch. Never interpret either as merging a PR.
**"merge"** means merging a PR, and only when the user says it explicitly.

If the user says "push" or "commit" right after one was already done, treat it as a mistake — do not merge.

## Contribution rules

**Always merge PRs with** `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch` to delete both the local and remote branch automatically after merging. Only skip `--delete-branch` if explicitly asked to keep the branch.

**Always update `CHANGELOG.md`** when making any user-facing change (features, fixes, behaviour changes, config changes). Do this in the same commit as the code change. Add entries under the current week's section (e.g. `## Week 22 (2026-04-20)`); if it doesn't exist yet, create it at the top. Week 0 starts Mon 2025-11-17; each week is +7 days (the date in the header is the Monday the week starts on). Releases cut every Monday morning ET — start a new week section on each Monday at **7am ET** (not midnight; before 7am Monday still belongs to the previous week's section). Link each entry to the relevant PR, issue, or commit (in that priority order).

## Dev commands

```bash
pnpm run dev          # ⚠️ BROKEN — use dev-https instead (see below)
pnpm run dev-https    # PartyKit dev server with HTTPS on port 1999
pnpm run storybook    # Storybook on localhost:6006
pnpm run deploy       # Deploy to PartyKit — see rules below
pnpm run deploy:staging  # Deploy to staging preview environment
pnpm run cachebust    # Production build with cache-busting
pnpm vitest           # Run all tests: Storybook stories (headless Chromium) + unit/component tests
```

**Test location:** new unit/component tests are co-located next to the file they test (e.g.
`app/lib/simulation/engine.test.ts` beside `engine.ts`). `.test.ts` runs in the `unit` (node)
project, `.test.tsx` in the `components` (jsdom) project. The `tests/` directory still holds older
tests; both locations are picked up by `vitest.config.ts`. Prefer co-location for new tests.

**`pnpm run dev` is currently broken for LAN access** — a partykit upstream bug ([partykit/partykit#764](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/764)) uses `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` for SPA routing detection, which browsers only send over HTTPS. Plain HTTP LAN addresses (e.g. `192.168.x.x:1999`) get a 404 instead of the app shell. Use `pnpm run dev-https` until this is resolved upstream.

`pnpm run dev-https` runs both the frontend and `party/server.ts` locally on port 1999 over HTTPS. The app is accessible at `localhost:1999` or any local network IP on port 1999 (e.g. `10.x.x.x:1999`). The WebSocket host is detected by port — if you're on port 1999, sockets connect to the local server; otherwise they connect to the deployed server.

### UUID generation

**Never use `crypto.randomUUID()` directly.** It only works in secure contexts (HTTPS + `localhost`). HTTP LAN addresses like `192.168.x.x` are not secure contexts — calling it throws silently and breaks any feature that generates IDs at runtime.

Always use `generateUUID()` from `app/utils/userId.ts` instead. It calls `crypto.randomUUID?.()` with a Math.random-based fallback.

### PartyKit CLI notes

Use `--force` (not `--yes`) to skip confirmation prompts — e.g. `pnpm exec partykit delete --preview stg --force`. `--yes` is not a valid partykit option and will error.

### Deploy rules

> **Never deploy uncommitted changes.** Always commit `party/server.ts` (and any other changed files) before running `npm run deploy`.

CI deploys automatically on merge to `main`. Deploying from the workstation is also appropriate when you want to test `party/server.ts` changes against the production URL or share with others before merging.

### Cache-busting and `public/index.html`

`public/index.html` is **generated** from `public/index.template.html` by `npm run cachebust`, which stamps `?v=<timestamp>` onto the JS and CSS asset URLs to force browsers to reload after a deploy.

`pnpm run deploy` runs cachebust automatically before uploading. `pnpm run dev` and `pnpm run dev-https` also run cachebust on startup to generate `public/index.html` fresh. `public/index.html` is gitignored — do not commit it.

## Architecture

- **`party/server.ts`** — PartyKit server: manages the statement queue, broadcasts cursor events, stores votes, serves the Polis API proxy
- **`app/client.tsx`** — Entry point: hash-based router (`#v1`–`#v5`) + `IndexApp` landing page
- **`app/components/`** — React components (see `docs/components.md`)
- **`app/styles.css`** — All CSS; components use class names defined here
- **`app/types.ts`** — Shared types (`PolisStatement`, `QueueItem`, `Statement`)
- **`app/voteLabels.ts`** — Reaction label presets and custom label encoding/decoding
