# CLAUDE.md

Tyran is a Claude Code plugin: skills, agents, `PreToolUse` hooks, and
zero-dependency Node scripts. No build step, no runtime deps, Node ≥ 22.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the dev loop, the test commands and
the enforced rules — they are not repeated here. This file is the rest: the
places where the obvious move is the wrong one, and the procedures that have
already cost someone a wasted release.

**The house rule that shapes everything else: one answer lives in one place.**
Before adding a paragraph, look for where the answer already is and link to it.
Three spellings of one rule is the defect this repo names ADR-21, and it has
been found here more than once.

## Two surfaces for every document

`docs/*.md` (GitHub) and `site/src/content/docs/*.mdx` (the docs site) publish
the same claims. **Change both, always.** They were migrated from each other
once and immediately diverged, because nobody re-reads a page they already
reviewed. `tests/unit/docs-claims.test.mjs` checks both surfaces.

Prose in this repo is checkable on purpose:

- **numbers are claims.** "47 unit tests" in a doc is verified against the
  actual count. Do not write a number you have not just measured.
- **`docs/doctor.md`'s severity table must equal `SEVERITY_BY_CODE`** in
  `scripts/doctor.mjs`, in both directions. Add a finding code, add the row.
- **no model name outside `tiers:`** — `tests/unit/agents.test.mjs` fails if
  `haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`/`fable` appears in any agent or skill file.

## Releasing — the version, not the commit

`claude plugin update` compares the **`version` field**, not the commit. A fix
merged to `main` without a bump reports *"already at the latest version"* and
reaches nobody. This has happened; it is the reason this section exists.

Bump all three in one commit — they are cross-checked by different tools:

| file | checked by |
|---|---|
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | what `claude plugin update` reads |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `claude plugin tag` fails if it disagrees with plugin.json |
| `package.json` | `npm-publish.yml` fails if it disagrees with the release tag |

Then `claude plugin tag .` (creates `tyran--v<version>`), plus a `v<version>`
tag — **both**, because they serve different consumers and neither covers the
other: `npm-publish.yml` computes `${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}`, which `tyran--v0.1.1`
does not satisfy.

Publishing to npm happens when a `v<version>` tag is pushed **or** a GitHub
release is published — `npm-publish.yml` triggers on both (a pushed tag was
added in 0.1.4, after the manual release step was skipped for three consecutive
versions and npm drifted three releases behind the marketplace). npm refuses a
duplicate version, so if both fire the second fails loudly rather than shipping
something different under the same number. Publishing is irreversible — a
version, once on npm, cannot be replaced.

## The gate runs on you too

`hooks/scripts/policy-gate.mjs` is live in any session working inside a repo
that has adopted Tyran. Two consequences that look like tool failures:

- **A `Bash` command whose text names `hooks/**` or `.tyran/policies/**` is
  refused** — including a validator. So
  `schema.mjs validate policy .tyran/policies/autonomy.yaml` is a command a
  *human* runs in a terminal; an agent uses
  `node scripts/doctor.mjs --state --dir .tyran`, which validates the same file
  and names only the directory.
- `Read` is not refused for those paths. Reach for it instead of `cat`.

**This repository adopted Tyran on 2026-08-17 (0.1.41)**, so the path classes
now DO apply to Tyran's own source, exactly as they do in a user's repo. The
consequence to plan around: **`hooks/**` is KERNEL, so an agent session cannot
edit the gates here.** A change to `hooks/scripts/*.mjs` is a human edit made
outside a session — which is what the class has always meant everywhere else,
and Tyran's own repo was the last place still exempt from its own rule.

Before that, the directory was absent and the gate was silent here; treat any
instruction that assumes an allowed `Edit hooks/…` as pre-0.1.41.

## The YAML subset is small, and it bites

`scripts/yaml-lite.mjs` rejects block scalars (`>-`, `|`), anchors, tags, flow
mappings and tabs — loudly, with a line number. Hand-writing a long `source:`
in a `.tyran/config.yaml` as `>-` produces a file the policy gate cannot parse,
which makes it refuse **every write in that repo**. Keep long values on one
single-quoted line. `stringify()` already does; humans and agents editing by
hand are the risk.

## The docs site

- **Cross-links must be relative** (`../policy-gate/`). The site is served from
  `jjanczur.github.io/tyran`, and `site/scripts/check-base-prefix.mjs` fails the
  Pages build on any root-absolute URL missing the base prefix.
- Building it locally needs `npx playwright install chromium-headless-shell` —
  the build renders og-images in a browser. Without it the build dies with a
  stack trace that says nothing about Playwright until you scroll.

```bash
cd site && npm ci && GITHUB_PAGES=true npm run build && node scripts/check-base-prefix.mjs
```

`npm run build`, not `npx astro build`: the build first generates the clickable
