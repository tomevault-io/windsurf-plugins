# Changesets (release notes)

This repo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). **Do not** hand-edit per-package `CHANGELOG.md` files for new work: they are updated automatically when releases run.

When a change should appear in the next release notes:

1. Add a new markdown file under `.changeset/` (e.g. `.changeset/some-topic.md`).
2. Use the standard frontmatter listing affected packages and bump type (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`):

   ```yaml
   ---
   "@prosemark/core": patch
   ---
   ```

   For multiple packages, list each on its own line under the same `---` block.

3. After the frontmatter, write a concise summary in the imperative or plain past tense, as you want it to read in the changelog.

Remove or avoid duplicate descriptions in `CHANGELOG.md`; rely on the changeset file only.
