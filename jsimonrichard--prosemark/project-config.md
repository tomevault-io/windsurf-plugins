# House rules

Rationale, examples, and this repo's specifics: **`AGENTS.md` § House rules**.
Short form — check each before handing work back:

1. **No silent fallbacks.** Impossible state → throw, don't degrade. Unclear
   permission → deny. Dangerous capability → the guard is a *required* argument.
   User-reachable error → surface it in the UI, not just the log. Expected
   failures are data, not exceptions.
2. **Upstream before workaround.** Prefer the framework's own mechanism, even if
   local code already works. Needed a workaround? Name the upstream mechanism you
   checked and why it failed. Derive values from their source; never restate
   them. Type guard over cast. Check sibling repos for prior art.
3. **Generalize; don't special-case.** Fixed one case? Check whether the general
   rule holds and unify on one path. A host never branches on plugin identity —
   add the hook to the contract instead. Then **delete** the special case or
   fallback you replaced.
4. **One concern per change.** No batching unrelated modules. N modules = N
   changes. Stop between steps of a multi-step feature. Narrower and complete
   beats wider and unpickable.
5. **Plan first for anything substantial.** Write it to a file: Goal /
   Principles / numbered sections / out of scope / success criteria. Get the plan
   reviewed before writing code.
6. **State what is not done.** Gaps, deferrals, and assumptions as precisely as
   the work. Skipped a check — say so. Quote failing output. Baseline
   pre-existing failures and report them as inherited. Verify doc claims against
   behavior, not against the prose around them.

## Required outputs

- **Before writing code — reuse survey.** Name the existing modules, tables,
  routes, and helpers that already touch this area and say which you are
  extending. Adding instead of extending? Say why the existing abstraction did
  not fit.
- **At handoff — diff shape.** Files changed, lines added/removed, and what the
  change let you delete. Adding far more than you remove is a signal to
  re-check, not progress.

## Where these bite in this repo

- **Layer first.** `packages/core` is the CodeMirror toolkit. `packages/{latex,
  render-html,paste-rich-text,spellcheck-frontend}` are opt-in extensions.
  `apps/vscode-extensions/*`, `apps/demo`, `apps/docs` are hosts. A behavior that
  belongs to an optional feature is a package, not a core flag.
- **Rule 1** — a missing `.cm-line`, a null `syntaxTree` node, or an absent
  webview API means a broken editor state: throw rather than fall back. See
  ProseMark #147, which removed exactly such a `coordsAtPos` fallback.
- **Rule 2** — CodeMirror, MathJax, and the VS Code webview API are upstream.
  Prefer a documented facet, `eq()`, or a type guard over coordinate math,
  `posAtDOM` probing, or an `as` cast.
- **Rule 3** — one measurement/decoration path for all nesting levels, not a
  branch per case. A single keymap facet, not per-field maps.
- **Rule 6** — user-facing changes get a `.changeset/` file; never hand-edit a
  package `CHANGELOG.md` (`.cursor/rules/changesets.mdc`).

Gate before every push: `bun run turbo build check-types lint format:check` —
the exact set CI runs. See `.cursor/rules/pre-push-quality.mdc`.
