# Green Mt Vending — Marketing Site

Static single-page marketing website for **Green Mt Vending** (Boulder, CO), deployed via GitHub Pages on the custom domain `greenmtvending.com` (DNS managed at Cloudflare).

## Project rules
- **Single self-contained file:** `index.html` with all CSS in one `<style>` block in the `<head>`. No build step, no external CSS/JS files, no frameworks.
- **No forms.** Contact is a `mailto:` link only.
- **Content is sourced from the live site** (`greenmtvending.com`) and the original `freehealthyvending.com` was used only as a *visual/structural* reference. Do not invent business facts (services, claims, locations, contact info).
- Clean, modern, health-forward UI. Fonts: **Sora** (headings) + **Inter** (body) via Google Fonts — matching the brand's existing typography.
- Green brand palette (emerald/forest greens).
