# EvoLean Lab working agreement

- Never report a conjecture as proved unless its exact formal statement passes Lean without `sorry` or new unsound axioms.
- Keep the original problem statement immutable. Store special cases, weakenings, and strengthened hypotheses as separate candidates with explicit parent links.
- Preserve provenance for literature claims, generated ideas, computational evidence, counterexamples, and formal artifacts.
- Use `VERIFIED`, `REFUTED`, `PARTIAL_PROGRESS`, or `UNRESOLVED` precisely.
- Treat model scores as search heuristics, never as mathematical evidence.
- Add tests for changes to selection, mutation, persistence, or verification behavior.
