`ort` is a tiny CLI for openrouter.ai. It sends a prompt to an AI and displays the result.

It is an opinionated, statically linked nightly Rust binary for Linux x86_64 that is `no_std`, has no external crate dependencies and does not use libc. It does direct syscalls in asm. Prioritize very small binary size and high performance.

It has three commands:
- Prompt: `ort -m <model-id> "The prompt"`. Default mode.
- List: `ort list` to show available models.
- Agent: `ort agent`, an in-progress agent mode.

After completing a change, always call these in order:
- `cargo fmt`
- `cargo clippy`
- `cargo test`
