## 1. Project Purpose

An open-source system enabling job seekers on LinkedIn and SEEK New Zealand to verify employer accreditation status with Immigration New Zealand (INZ) without leaving the job page.

- **Production Site**: https://nzaei.zemo.bio
- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: [`docs/extension-api-ssot.md`](./docs/extension-api-ssot.md) — *All contract, state machine, and data model changes must align with this document.*

## 2. Inviolable System Invariants (Red Lines)

When modifying any part of this repository, you **MUST NOT** violate these design principles:

1. **No Worker-to-INZ Calls**: Cloudflare Workers **never** call INZ endpoints directly (avoids centralized IP blocks). Live INZ lookups are executed exclusively by the user's browser extension background script, which submits raw responses back to the Worker.
2. **Explicit User Action Only**: Page loads **never** trigger automatic live lookups. A live check occurs only when the user explicitly clicks *Check NZ accreditation*. A single click triggers **at most one** live INZ request.
3. **Strict Evidence & Trust Separation**:
   - **Official INZ Facts**: Legal name, trading name, 13-digit NZBN, accreditation expiry date.
   - **Community Association**: Mapping of platform page (LinkedIn/SEEK) to an NZBN, tracked via anonymized client hashes and confirmation counts.
   - **Derived Exact Match**: Ephemeral on-the-fly string equality between normalized platform display name and official/trading name. *Never persisted as a community confirmation.*
   - **No-Match Observation**: Negative cache inside a configured TTL (default 7 days). Proves only that a specific query yielded no published record at that time; not proof of non-accreditation.
4. **Server-Owned Provenance**: Clients cannot supply timestamps, verification status flags, or authority assertions. The Worker owns `last_verified_at` and evaluates expiry against Pacific/Auckland calendar dates.
5. **No Account Tracking**: The extension generates a random installation UUID (`crypto.randomUUID()`) sent as `X-Client-ID`. The Worker hashes it with SHA-256 before storing. Never extract or store LinkedIn/SEEK user account identities.

## 3. Monorepo Layout & Tech Stack

Each workspace is independently managed. Requirements: **Node.js >= 22**.

| Subproject | Path | Tech Stack | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Extension** | [`extension/`](./extension) | WXT, Vite, TypeScript, Shadow DOM | Manifest V3 Chrome extension for LinkedIn & SEEK. |
| **API** | [`api/`](./api) | Cloudflare Workers, D1 (SQLite), R2 | Employer resolution, ingest, negative cache, FTS5 search, open-data crons. |
| **Landing** | [`landing/`](./landing) | Astro 5, Cloudflare Pages, Observable Plot | Product site, privacy policy, open-data catalog, LLM contexts (`llms.txt`). |
| **Refresh Script**| [`scripts/employer-refresh/`](./scripts/employer-refresh) | Node.js ESM | Operator-run batch refresh for near-expiry employers (outside extension path). |
| **Docs** | [`docs/`](./docs) | Markdown | Architecture SSOT and Cloudflare deployment runbooks. |
