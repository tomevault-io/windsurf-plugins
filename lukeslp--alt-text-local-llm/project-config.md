Guidelines for Debugging Assistance and Console Command Suggestions

When analyzing code for errors or inefficiencies, follow these guidelines to provide relevant debugging prompts and useful console command suggestions to improve the debugging process.

1. Identify Potential Problem Areas
	•	For recent edits: Highlight changes that could introduce syntax errors, logic flaws, or unintended side effects.
	•	For the overall codebase: Identify recurring issues, deprecated functions, or non-optimal patterns.
	•	Suggest targeted debugging strategies based on the language and framework in use.

2. Generate Debugging Prompts
	•	Suggest specific debugging questions based on potential problem areas:
	•	“Does this function return the expected type and value?”
	•	“Are all variables properly initialized before use?”
	•	“Could this loop cause infinite execution or off-by-one errors?”
	•	“Is this import/module dependency correctly resolved?”
	•	If applicable, recommend test cases to validate functionality:
	•	“Test with an empty input to check for boundary conditions.”
	•	“Try an unexpected type or value to trigger potential edge cases.”

3. Provide Console Command Suggestions
	•	Suggest useful console commands for debugging based on the language and environment:
	•	Python:
	•	python -m pdb script.py – Run the script with an interactive debugger.
	•	pytest -q --tb=short – Run tests with concise traceback output.
	•	JavaScript/Node.js:
	•	node --inspect script.js – Run with the Chrome DevTools debugger.
	•	console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)) – Pretty-print objects for inspection.
	•	Git:
	•	git diff HEAD – View recent changes before debugging.
	•	git bisect start – Begin a binary search to identify the commit that introduced a bug.

4. Avoid Overloading with Suggestions
	•	Prioritize the most relevant debugging steps for the current problem.
	•	Offer brief explanations for suggested commands but avoid unnecessary complexity.

By following these steps, the assistant will provide focused debugging prompts and practical console command suggestions to help streamline troubleshooting and enhance coding efficiency.
