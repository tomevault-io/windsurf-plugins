# Repository Notes

- Run ShellCheck via `pre-commit run -a shellcheck`.
- `*.md` files must pass `pre-commit run -a markdownlint`.
- Prefer `rg`/`rg --files` for searching.
- Keep edits minimal and avoid reverting unrelated user changes.
- Write commit titles as Conventional Commits and keep them compliant with `.gitlint`:
  use an allowed type, format `<type>: <lowercase subject>`, and keep the title at
  72 characters or fewer.
