# Plan-first workflow

`AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for repository instructions. If this rule conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md`.

This workflow applies to implementation changes. It does not block pure review or read-only analysis requests.

When the user asks to implement, fix, refactor, debug, or change behavior:

1. Inspect the relevant code before proposing a plan.
2. Do not write implementation code until you have produced a plan.
3. The plan must reference concrete files, symbols, and line numbers when available.
4. Do not invent file paths, functions, or line numbers. If something has not been inspected, say so.
5. Every meaningful implementation step must mention the files or symbols it affects.
6. Include verification steps: tests, build commands, or manual checks.
7. If the request is ambiguous, ask a concise clarifying question before planning.
8. If the user says "plan only", stop after the plan and wait.
9. If the user asks to proceed, implement according to the plan.

Use this plan format:

## Goal

One short paragraph describing the intended outcome.

## Code Facts

- `path/to/File.swift:line` - observed behavior or relevant symbol.
- `path/to/OtherFile.swift:line` - related dependency or constraint.

## Plan

1. Change `path/to/File.swift` in `SymbolName` to ...
2. Update `path/to/OtherFile.swift` because ...
3. Add or update tests in `path/to/TestFile.swift` for ...

## Verification

- Run `swift build`
- Run relevant tests
- Manually verify ...

# Language

Respond to the user in Russian.
Write code and code comments in English.
