# Release guardrails

Do not modify release metadata or release artifacts unless the user explicitly asks to prepare or publish a release.
Reading protected release files for verification or review is allowed.

Protected paths and metadata:

- `VERSION`
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- `dist/**`
- Git tags
- GitHub releases
- `OWAWidget/Info.plist` key `SUPublicEDKey`

Release workflow rules:

- For "prepare release", update `VERSION` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, commit release metadata before packaging, run `make release-package`, and verify that the new `sparkle:version` is strictly greater than the previous published release.
- For "publish release", complete the full GitHub release flow only after packaging succeeds.
- Do not manually update `CFBundleShortVersionString` or `CFBundleVersion` in `OWAWidget/Info.plist`; `make bundle` and `make release-package` derive those values from `VERSION` and git commit count.
- Do not publish unsigned Sparkle release artifacts.
