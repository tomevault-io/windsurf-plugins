# Swift 6 concurrency

Preserve strict Swift 6 concurrency boundaries.

Observed project facts:

- `OWAWidget/Services/CalendarService.swift:27` declares `CalendarService` as `@MainActor`.
- `OWAWidget/Services/CalendarService.swift:29` through `OWAWidget/Services/CalendarService.swift:33` expose UI-observed `@Published private(set)` state.
- `OWAWidget/Providers/CalendarProvider.swift:5` declares `CalendarProvider` as an `Actor`.
- `OWAWidget/Services/CalendarService.swift:35` stores providers as `[any CalendarProvider]`.
- `OWAWidget/Services/CalendarService.swift:318` through `OWAWidget/Services/CalendarService.swift:325` use `withThrowingTaskGroup` to fetch provider events concurrently.

Rules:

- Treat `CalendarService` as the main-actor state owner. Do not mutate its published state from non-main actor contexts.
- Keep calendar providers actor-isolated. Do not convert providers to classes or structs unless the concurrency design is explicitly reworked.
- When crossing actor boundaries, make `Sendable` reasoning explicit in the plan.
- Do not add `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated`, detached tasks, or broad `@MainActor` annotations to silence compiler warnings without a concrete explanation.
- Prefer dependency-injected protocols for tests over global state or sleeps.
- When editing async sync, notification, scheduler, or provider code, check for races between manual sync, scheduled sync, provider rebuilds, event cache fallback, and reminder rescheduling.

Relevant tests to consider:

- `Tests/OWAWidgetTests/CalendarServiceOfflineTests.swift`
- `Tests/OWAWidgetTests/SyncSchedulerTests.swift`
- `Tests/OWAWidgetTests/SyncRequestGateTests.swift`
- `Tests/OWAWidgetTests/NotificationServiceAggregationTests.swift`
- `Tests/OWAWidgetTests/MeetingReminderScheduleTests.swift`
