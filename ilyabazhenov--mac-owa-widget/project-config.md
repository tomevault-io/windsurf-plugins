# Project context

`AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for repository-specific agent instructions. If any Cursor rule conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md`.

OWAWidget is a Swift 6 / SwiftUI macOS menu bar app for showing upcoming Microsoft Exchange / OWA meetings and quickly joining online calls.

Primary code lives in `OWAWidget/`.

Important files and responsibilities:

- `OWAWidget/OWAWidgetApp.swift` - app entry point, `MenuBarExtra`, settings window, notification handling.
- `OWAWidget/Services/CalendarService.swift` - main `@MainActor` observable state owner for accounts, events, sync status, reminders, and engagement stats.
- `OWAWidget/Providers/CalendarProvider.swift` - actor-based provider abstraction.
- `OWAWidget/Providers/OWA/**` - OWA authentication, CANARY token handling, calendar requests, response mapping.
- `OWAWidget/Providers/GoogleCalendar/GoogleCalendarProvider.swift` - placeholder provider for future Google Calendar support.
- `OWAWidget/Services/MeetingURLDetector.swift` - meeting URL detection for Teams, Zoom, Webex, Google Meet, and related platforms.
- `OWAWidget/Services/NotificationService.swift` - local notification scheduling.
- `OWAWidget/Services/KeychainService.swift` - password storage in Keychain.
- `OWAWidget/Services/LaunchAtLoginService.swift` - login item integration via `SMAppService.mainApp`.
- `OWAWidget/Services/UpdateCheckService.swift` - Sparkle updater wrapper.
- `OWAWidget/Views/MeetingListView.swift` - timeline list in the popover, including time grid and overlay cards.
- `OWAWidget/Views/TimelineMeetingLayout.swift` - timeline slotting, overlap clusters, lanes, and frame math.
- `OWAWidget/Views/TimelineMeetingBlockView.swift` - visual meeting card for normal and compact timeline layouts.

Build and run commands come from `Makefile`:

- `swift build` - fast compile verification.
- `make build` - compile via Makefile.
- `make run` - build bundle and launch the app.
- `make watch` - rebuild on Swift file changes; requires `fswatch`.
- `make clean` - remove build artifacts.

Do not manually edit generated `OWAWidget.xcodeproj`. Update `project.yml` for XcodeGen project settings and `Package.swift` for SwiftPM settings.
