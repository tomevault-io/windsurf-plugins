# Verification

Before reporting completion:

- If Swift code, app logic, tests, models, views, services, providers, scripts, or project configuration changed, run `swift build` at minimum.
- If packaging, entitlements, app bundle launch, Sparkle, `Info.plist`, resources, app icons, or release scripts changed, also run `make run`.
- If release notes changed, run `make validate-release-notes`.
- If timeline layout changed, run the focused timeline/layout tests when possible in addition to `swift build`.
- If OWA request/response mapping changed, run focused OWA tests when possible in addition to `swift build`.
- If only Cursor rules, docs, comments, or ignore files changed, do not run `swift build` unless there is a specific reason.
- For `.cursor/rules/**` and `.cursorignore` only changes, no build or runtime command is required.

Final response must include:

- Changed files.
- Verification commands that were run.
- Pass/fail result, including any command that could not be run and why.
