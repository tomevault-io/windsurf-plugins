# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Run

**Must use `xcodebuild`** (not `swift build`) — Metal shader support required by MLX:

```bash
# Build CLI (Release)
xcodebuild -scheme gemma4-cli -configuration Release \
  -destination "platform=macOS" -derivedDataPath .build/xcode \
  -skipMacroValidation build

# Binary location
.build/xcode/Build/Products/Release/gemma4-cli

# Run tests
xcodebuild -scheme Gemma4Swift -destination "platform=macOS" \
  -derivedDataPath .build/xcode -skipMacroValidation test
```

## Architecture

Swift 6.0 / macOS 14+ / Apple Silicon only. Two products: `Gemma4Swift` library and `gemma4-cli` executable.

### Multimodal Pipeline

The model fuses text, vision, and audio through **masked_scatter** — special tokens in the text embedding sequence are replaced with projected modality embeddings:

1. **VisionEncoder** (SigLIP): image → patches → 2D RoPE transformer → pooler → 280 soft tokens per image
2. **AudioEncoder** (Conformer): PCM → mel-spectrogram → SubSampleConv → ConformerBlocks → variable-length tokens
3. **MultimodalEmbedder**: projects modality tokens into text embedding space
4. **Gemma4Model**: calls `maskedScatter()` to splice modality embeddings at `[boi]`/`[boa]` token positions

### Text Model Internals

The decoder has two layer types with different configurations:
- **Full attention layers**: use `global_head_dim` (512), ProportionalRoPE (25% partial rotation)
- **Sliding window layers**: use `head_dim` (256), standard RoPE
- **KV sharing**: layers 15+ reuse KV cache from earlier layers
- **Per-layer input gating**: each layer receives additional embeddings via `per_layer_input_gate` (for E2B/E4B models with `hidden_size_per_layer_input`)
- **Double-wide MLP**: KV-shared layers use 2x intermediate size

### Registration System

`Gemma4Registration.register()` registers `"gemma4"` and `"gemma4_text"` model types with mlx-swift-lm's `LLMTypeRegistry`. This enables loading via `loadModelContainer()` and usage with `ChatSession`/`ModelContainer`. Text-only vs multimodal is controlled by `register(multimodal:)`.

### Weight Loading

`WeightSanitizer` remaps PyTorch checkpoint keys to the Swift module hierarchy:
- Strips `"model."` prefix, remaps `"language_model.X"` → `"language_model.model.X"`
- Skips rotary_emb and unused clipping params
- Splits MoE `gate_up_proj` into separate gate/up projections

### Speculative Decoding (MTP)

Supports `gemma-4-{E2B,E4B}-it-assistant` drafter models for multi-token prediction. The drafter is a 4-layer mini-transformer (hidden 256) where **all layers are kv-shared-only** — they consume the target's K/V cache via `bind(target:)` + `setSharedKV(...)` instead of computing their own.

Key files:
- `Speculative/Gemma4AssistantDraftModel.swift` — drafter with `draftBlock` (autoregressive K-step) and `trainForward` (parallel multi-position, used during fine-tuning)
- `Speculative/MaskedEmbedder.swift` — sparse softmax LM head: scores 2048 token clusters, picks top-K=32, computes dense logits only on the ~4096 tokens of those clusters
- `Speculative/SpeculativeWalk.swift` — pure-logic greedy walk (accept until first divergence)
- `Speculative/Gemma4DrafterTraining.swift` — self-distillation training (target frozen, drafter trainable, CE loss against `argmax(target_logits)`)
- `Pipeline/Gemma4MTPPipeline.swift` — actor with `mtpStream(...)` end-to-end (prefill → draft → verify → walk → rollback)

Quirks:
- The drafter checkpoint OMITS `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `k_norm` weights — they're optional in `Gemma4Attention` gated by `kvSharedOnly: Bool` (default `false`, back-compat).
- `Gemma4TextModel.forwardCollectingIntermediates` exposes the LAST decoder layer's output **BEFORE** the final RMSNorm via `preNormHidden` — the drafter's `pre_projection` was trained against pre-norm.
- For kv-shared inference path with cache, queries get RoPE at `cache.offset - L` (pre-write offset), not `cache.offset` (post-write).
- During training, `MaskedEmbedder` is bypassed via `useFullLMHead = true` because `putAlong` (scatter) has no VJP in MLX.

## Key Conventions

- All neural network types subclass `Module` from MLXNN with `@ModuleInfo` property wrappers for parameter tracking
- `@unchecked Sendable` is used where needed for MLXArray (Swift 6 strict concurrency)
- RoPE selection uses factory pattern: `RoPEFactory.create()` picks standard vs proportional based on layer type
- Special token IDs are constants in `Gemma4Processor` (e.g., `imageTokenId = 258880`)

## Supported Models

- `mlx-community/gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit` (~3.6 GB, 2.3B effective params)
- `mlx-community/gemma-4-e4b-it-4bit` (~5 GB, 4B effective params)
