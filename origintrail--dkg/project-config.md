# DKG annotation protocol

This workspace is bound to a DKG context graph. Use the `dkg` MCP server to keep the graph rich and convergent.

## After every substantive turn

Call **`dkg_annotate_turn`** exactly once. A turn is "substantive" if it reasoned, proposed, examined, or referenced something — basically every turn that wasn't a one-line acknowledgement. Over-eagerness is not a failure mode; under-coverage is.

**Always pass `forSession`.** The session ID is in the session-start `additionalContext` ("Your current session ID: `<id>`"). Race-free deferred rendezvous: the tool queues the annotation, the capture hook applies it to your actual turn URI when it writes the next `chat:Turn` for the session. Never try to predict your own turn URI — it doesn't exist yet.

Minimum payload:

```jsonc
dkg_annotate_turn({
  forSession: "<session id from additionalContext>",
  topics:   [<2-3 short topic strings>],
  mentions: [<URIs found via dkg_search; mint fresh ones if no match>]
})
```

Add `examines` / `proposes` / `concludes` / `asks` / `proposedDecisions` / `proposedTasks` / `comments` / `vmPublishRequests` when the turn warrants them. The full schema is in the agent guide returned by `dkg_get_ontology`.

## Look-before-mint protocol (the convergence rule)

Before minting any new `urn:dkg:<type>:<slug>` URI:

1. Compute the normalised slug: `lowercase → ASCII-fold → strip stopwords (the/a/an/of/for/and/or/to/in/on/with) → hyphenate → ≤60 chars`.
2. Call `dkg_search` with the unnormalised label.
3. If any result's normalised slug matches yours, **REUSE** that URI.
4. Otherwise mint fresh per the URI patterns below. **Never fabricate URIs** for entities that don't exist yet.

## URI patterns

```
urn:dkg:concept:<slug>      free-text concept (skos:Concept)
urn:dkg:topic:<slug>        broad topical bucket
urn:dkg:question:<slug>     open question
urn:dkg:finding:<slug>      preserved claim/observation
urn:dkg:decision:<slug>     architectural decision
urn:dkg:task:<slug>         work item
```

## Reference

Call `dkg_get_ontology` once per session for the full agent guide + formal Turtle/OWL ontology. The session-start hook injects a summary so this is mostly a refresher; consult it whenever uncertain about which predicate to use.

VM publish is **always** human-gated. Use `dkg_request_vm_publish` to write a marker; never publish on-chain directly.
