description: Core safety and quality constraints for this Obsidian community plugin
---


# Obsidian project

- Build for the Community Plugins directory and preserve desktop/mobile compatibility.
- Develop and manually test only in a dedicated disposable vault, never a primary or valuable vault.
- Default to local/offline behavior. Treat vault content, filenames, settings, and paths as private.
- Do not add client-side telemetry, self-updates, remote code, or undisclosed network/outside-vault access.
- Keep `src/main.ts` limited to lifecycle and registration; put feature logic in focused modules.
- Do not track `main.js`, source maps, `data.json`, `node_modules`, or vault contents.

Before calling work complete:

1. Run build and lint.
2. Run tests; report a missing test script.
3. Check lifecycle cleanup, privacy/network impact, and mobile compatibility.
4. Keep dedicated-vault desktop/mobile smoke tests visibly pending unless actually completed.

Use `AGENTS.md`, `docs/development.md`, and `docs/releasing.md` for the full procedures.
