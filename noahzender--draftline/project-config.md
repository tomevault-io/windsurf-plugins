# Obsidian manifest and release

- A released plugin ID is immutable.
- `id` uses lowercase letters/hyphens, does not contain `obsidian`, and does not end with `plugin`.
- The development folder name equals the manifest ID.
- The display name must not contain `Obsidian` or `Plugin`.
- Keep `manifest.json` and `package.json` versions identical.
- Map every release version to its exact `minAppVersion` in `versions.json`.
- Keep `isDesktopOnly: false` unless source or dependencies require Node.js/Electron.
- Keep `minAppVersion` no lower than the newest Obsidian API used.
- Release tags exactly equal the manifest version without a leading `v`.
- Release only `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optional `styles.css`.

Before changing release metadata, follow `docs/releasing.md` and verify current upstream requirements.
