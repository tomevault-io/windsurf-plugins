# CLAUDE.md — ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas

Read this first. `DEVELOPMENT.md` has the long version (mechanisms, gotchas,
test recipes, roadmap). `README.md` is the user-facing manual.

## What this is

A Krita-style inpainting node for ComfyUI, built for and with DenRakEiw
(GitHub: DenRakEiw, repo https://github.com/DenRakEiw/ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas).
One node holds image, layers, selection and prompt; the selected region goes
out as a crop, any inpaint chain works on it, and the result is wired **back
into the same node** and lands as a new layer. The user's real chain is the
Flux.2 [max] API node (returns RGBA, square unless width/height are wired).

## Layout

- `nodes.py` — `InpaintCanvas` (OUTPUT_NODE, always re-executes),
  `InpaintCanvasStitch` (OUTPUT_NODE, also used ephemerally), and the helpers
  `InpaintCanvasLoadRef` (ref JSON -> IMAGE), `InpaintCanvasMaskOut`
  (MASK -> temp PNG + `ui.inpaint_mask`; purpose `segments` encodes a batch as
  a label map, purpose `cutout` is a layer mask), `InpaintCanvasObjectMap`
  (SAM2 automask -> label map for the hover object tool) and
  `InpaintCanvasTextOut` (STRING -> `ui.inpaint_text`, prompt upsampling).
  One HTTP route, `POST /inpaint_canvas/cleanup` (file housekeeping).
- `js/inpaint_canvas.js` — the whole frontend: node thumbnail widget, the
  full-window editor (`InpaintEditor`), state persistence, prompt rewriting.
- `js/inpaint_text.js` — text layers: bundled fonts (`js/fonts/*.ttf`,
  manifest `fonts.json`, OFL / Apache licences in `js/fonts/licenses`), user
  fonts from `input/inpaint_canvas/fonts` (route `GET /inpaint_canvas/fonts`),
  `renderText()` draws a layer's `text` description at 2x.
- `js/inpaint_export.js` — PSD (PackBits) and ORA (stored zip) writers,
  `js/inpaint_raster.js` — flood fill and mask helpers for bucket / wand.
- `js/inpaint_filters.js` (+ `inpaint_curves.js`, the curves editor) — the
  filter layers (grain, sharpen, blur, levels, curves, brightness/contrast,
  hue/saturation, colour balance, black & white, invert, LUT,
  vignette): pure Canvas 2D / pixel loops, registry `FILTERS`. New filters go
  here, not into the editor file.
- `pyproject.toml` + `.github/workflows/publish_action.yml` — Comfy Registry
  (`PublisherId = "denrakeiw"`, secret `REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN` is the user's).
- Local install path: `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas`.
  An empty locked `custom_nodes/inpaint` shell may still exist; delete it.

## Invariants — do not break these

1. **The back-links are never sent to the backend.** `api.queuePrompt` wrapper
   turns `inputs.result` / `inputs.result_local` (links) into
   `inputs.result_source` / `result_source_local = "id:slot"`. ComfyUI's
   `validate_inputs` rejects real cycles. Only the chain of the editor's mode
   (`gen.mode`) is expanded, the other never runs.
2. **The canvas node always re-executes** (`IS_CHANGED` returns NaN). A cached
   node cannot expand the ephemeral stitch, and `IS_CHANGED` is called with an
   empty `prompt`, so it cannot hash the state anyway.
3. **The stitch result reaches the frontend through `display_node`.** The
   ephemeral node's UI output is attributed to the canvas node; the frontend
   handles it in `onExecuted`. UI key is `inpaint_result`, never `images`
   (that would trigger ComfyUI's built-in image preview).
4. **`canvas_state` is a DOM widget, not a declared input.** Its
   `serializeValue` uploads flattened image, mask and control PNGs and returns
   a small JSON; the backend reads it from the hidden `PROMPT`. Undeclared
   prompt inputs are ignored by validation. Keep it that way.
5. **Adding a widget shifts `widgets_values` of saved workflows.** The
   `onConfigure` migration finds the JSON and puts it back. Keep it working
   when you add widgets; prefer adding new state to the JSON instead.
6. **`getValue` must never return `{}` while a restore is loading**
   (autosave would wipe the canvas). It returns `lastValueString`.
7. Layer pixels are never stored in the workflow. Dirty layers are uploaded on
   editor close and before every run (`syncLayers`).
8. **Editor features that need a model run use helper prompts**, never the
   user's graph: the frontend queues a tiny prompt (`api.queuePrompt(-1, ...)`,
   front of the queue) made of loader/model nodes plus `InpaintCanvasMaskOut`,
   and picks the result up from the `executed` event by `canvas_node`. The
   user runs paid API nodes; a helper must never trigger the main chain.

## User preferences (stated explicitly)

- Push and commit as **DenRakEiw**, not as Claude, no Claude trailer in commit
  messages. Use `git -c user.name=DenRakEiw -c user.email=89697885+DenRakEiw@users.noreply.github.com`
  and push with `-c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential'`.
- One node, one window. No helper nodes for the round trip, no in-node canvas.
- Icons, not text, for tools. Krita/Photoshop vocabulary. Answer in German.
- The user asks for features by Krita name; the roadmap is in DEVELOPMENT.md.

## Where things stand (2026-09-05, late)

Everything described in README.md is built and verified. The latest additions
(DEVELOPMENT.md 12-14): reference layers (appended to the crop_image
batch), layer masks / cutouts through the installed RMBG nodes, the file
