Read and respect rules and conventions from CONTRIBUTING.md. Additionally:

# Quick Reference

All commands are run from the root of the repo.

- `pnpm test:unit` - run all unit tests - first line of defense, should be run first, takes ~20s on a modern machine
- `pnpm test:coverage` - run unit tests with coverage report output to terminal (and report files to `coverage/`)
- `pnpm test:integration` - run all integration tests - much more expensive, takes ~3 mins on a modern machine, use sparingly or as a final validation check
- `pnpm test` - run all tests
- `pnpm test[:unit|:integration] <test-file>` - run specific test file(s); the arg is a path substring match. Example: `pnpm test documents/__tests__/get`
- `pnpm format [paths...]` - format files with oxfmt
- `pnpm check:format` - verify formatting with oxfmt
- `pnpm check:types` - TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm check:lint` - check code with ESLint
- `pnpm lint:fix` - fix auto-fixable ESLint issues
- `pnpm check:deps` - unused dependency / export check
- `pnpm build:cli` - build the project
- `pnpm watch:cli` - build in watch mode
- `pnpm test:e2e <file>` - run specific e2e test file (args pass through to vitest)
- `pnpm test:e2e <file> -t "<pattern>"` - run specific e2e test by name

# Workflow

- Be sure to format, typecheck, lint, build, depcheck and run tests when you are done.
- Testing coverage should be maximized. Prefer running tests with coverage and the goal is to achieve maximum unit testing coverage for any new code added.
- When creating pull requests, always follow the template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Do not use your own format.
- Releasable changes need a changeset, normally auto-generated from the PR's "Notes for release" section (empty uses the PR title; `N/A` skips it). See CONTRIBUTING.md "Automatic Changesets"; a hand-authored `.changeset/` file also works and takes precedence.

# Flow UX

`packages/@sanity/cli-core/src/ux/flowOutput.ts` is reserved for the `new.ts` command. Before reusing its [`@clack/prompts`-style output](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clack/prompts) in another CLI feature, clearly articulate the compelling use case to the end user or harness.

# Telemetry redaction

Flag telemetry keeps its existing value unless the command opts into redaction with `defineCommandTelemetry`:

```ts
const flags = {
  file: Flags.string({description: 'Input file'}),
  format: Flags.string({options: ['json', 'ndjson']}),
}
static flags = flags
static telemetry = defineCommandTelemetry(flags, {
  redact: ['file'],
})
// --file=private.ndjson --format=json
// telemetry: ["--file", "--format=json"]
```

The helper type-checks names against the command's option flags and applies the declaration to registered aliases. When configuring a command, consider whether an input can contain PII, customer data, credentials, local paths, or other unbounded user content, and weigh that risk against any concrete support or debugging need for the value. Add focused coverage for the flag forms the command supports.

# Testing Rules

Follow all instructions and guidance laid out in the Testing Requirements section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

**Never pipe test output.** The following are all forbidden:

```bash
pnpm test 2>&1 | tail -3      # discards failures
pnpm test 2>&1 | grep FAIL    # runs full suite just to filter
pnpm test 2>&1 | head -20     # discards the information you need
```

Always read results from the JSON file instead (see "Reading test results" below).

## Running tests

First, compute the output path (derived from cwd, matches `vitest.config.ts`):

```bash
TEST_RESULTS="/tmp/test-results-$(echo -n "$(pwd)" | sha1sum | cut -c1-8).json"
```

Next determine whether to run unit tests or integration tests. Start with unit tests as they take less time to complete. Depending on the available resources of the local machine, integration tests may experience failures like test worker deaths from OS signals. Older node versions, like node v22, experience these more frequently than newer versions. Export a `RUNTASK` variable choosing which tests to run:

```bash
RUNTASK="test:unit" # or "test:integration" for integration tests, or simply "test" for all tests
```

Then run one of:

```bash
# Only tests affected by uncommitted changes (preferred starting point)
pnpm $RUNTASK --changed --bail=1

# Scoped to package
pnpm $RUNTASK --project=@sanity/cli --bail=1

# Single file (when debugging a specific failure) — the file arg is a substring
# match against the path, so a unique fragment is enough
pnpm $RUNTASK topicAliases

# Single test within a file: by name (-t, a regex) or by line number (needs full path)
pnpm $RUNTASK topicAliases -t "rewrites \"dataset list\""
pnpm $RUNTASK packages/@sanity/cli/src/hooks/commandNotFound/__tests__/topicAliases.test.ts:23

# Full suite (avoid — only for final validation before committing)
pnpm $RUNTASK --bail=3
```

## Reading test results

After ANY test run, read from `$TEST_RESULTS` — never re-run or grep stdout:

```bash
# Get all failures with error messages (truncated)
jq '[.testResults[] | select(.status == "failed") | {
  file: (.name | split("/") | .[-3:] | join("/")),
  failures: [.assertionResults[] | select(.status == "failed") | {
