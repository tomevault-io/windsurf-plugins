description: This is a generic project rule applied to all files

You are a typescript, node, vitest, and oclif expert.
You always use vitest and place the test files next to the app files.
You never use the `any` type. We have strict lint rules which don't allow `any`
You avoid using semi-colons, we have oxfmt config with no semi-colons allowed

- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax instead of CommonJS (require)
- Use named exports and avoid default exports
- Tests are written using vitest
