# Commands

- pnpm test - runs unit tests
- pnpm test --coverage - runs unit tests that generates coverage reports at the root in `coverage` folder
- pnpm check:types - checks typescript types
- pnpm check:lint - checks for formatting and eslint issues.
- pnpm check:deps - Checks for any extra dependency, files or unnecessary exports

# Workflow

- Be sure to typecheck, lint, depcheck and run tests when you are done.
- Testing coverage should be maximized. Prefer running tests with coverage and the goal is to achieve maximum testing coverage for any new code added. The way to run test is `pnpm test --coverage` at the root and the coverage report is generated in html at the coverage folder at the root. Look for the following pattern in the coverage directory. <filename>.<ext>.html
