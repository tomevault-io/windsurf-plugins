# Agents Guidelines for Asterinas and Mariposa

Asterinas is a Linux-compatible, general-purpose OS kernel
written in Rust using the framekernel architecture.
`unsafe` Rust is confined to OSTD (`ostd/`);
the kernel (`kernel/`) is entirely safe Rust.

Mariposa is a research platform for learned policies, based on the Asterinas kernel. Components
expose events and state by creating OQueues (Observable Queues, see `ostd/src/orpc/oqueue/mod.rs`).
Components can use those OQueues to observe other components.

## Repository Layout

| Directory    | Purpose                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `kernel/`    | Safe-Rust OS kernel (syscalls, VFS, networking, etc.)    |
| `ostd/`      | OS framework — the only crate permitted to use `unsafe`  |
| `osdk/`      | `cargo-osdk` CLI tool for building/running/testing       |
| `test/`      | Regression and syscall tests (C user-space programs)     |
| `distro/`    | Asterinas NixOS distribution configuration               |
| `tools/`     | Utility scripts (formatting, Docker, benchmarking, etc.) |
| `book/`      | The Asterinas Book (mdBook documentation)                |

## Building and Running

All development is done inside the project Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --privileged --network=host -v /dev:/dev \
  -v $(pwd)/asterinas:/root/asterinas \
  ldosproject/asterinas:0.18.0-ldos-20260831
```

Key Makefile targets:

| Command              | What it does                                         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `make kernel`        | Build initramfs and the kernel                       |
| `make run_kernel`    | Build and run in QEMU                                |
| `make test`          | Unit tests for non-OSDK crates (`cargo test`)        |
| `make ktest`         | Kernel-mode unit tests via `cargo osdk test` in QEMU |
| `make check`         | Full lint: rustfmt, clippy, typos, license checks    |
| `make format`        | Auto-format Rust, Nix, and C code                    |
| `make docs`          | Build rustdocs for all crates                        |

Set `TARGET_ARCH` to `x86_64` (default), `riscv64`, or `loongarch64`.

## Baseline mode

Mariposa has two modes:
* **baseline_asterinas**: does not have OQueues (Observable Queues, see
  `ostd/src/orpc/oqueue/mod.rs`)
  * Close to Asterinas, but with extensions required for basic policies
  * Provides benchmarking baseline for the overhead and advantages of Mariposa
* **Mariposa (default)**: has OQueues
  * Full support for observability and policy selection

Baseline mode is selected by adding `BASELINE_ASTERINAS=1` on the make command line. For example,
`make check BASELINE_ASTERINAS=1`.

### Mode specific code

`#[cfg(not(baseline_asterinas))]` is used to gate Mariposa code which uses OQueues.
`#[cfg(baseline_asterinas)]` is used to gate baseline code. When possible share code by using
neither gate. Keep the gated code as small as possible (for instance, by gating blocks within a
larger function).

Gate a use only if it references Mariposa-only items. Leftover unused imports in baseline are
allowed; when clippy is run form `cfg(baseline_asteras)` it is given `-A unused-imports`,

## Toolchain

- **Rust nightly** pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- **Edition:** 2024.
- `rustfmt.toml`: imports grouped as Std / External / Crate
  (`imports_granularity = "Crate"`, `group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"`).
- Clippy lints are configured in the workspace `Cargo.toml`
  under `[workspace.lints.clippy]`.
  Every member crate must have `[lints] workspace = true`.

## Coding Guidelines

The coding guidelines are the authoritative standard
for both **writing** and **reviewing** code.
The guidelines are organized by **persona**:
five durable engineering roles,
each a page whose Index doubles as that persona's review checklist.
Consult the persona whose concern matches your change.
Each Index lists every guideline as a stable `short-name` paired with a one-line gist,
so you can grasp a rule from the table and open its full text only when needed.

| Persona | Focus | Index |
|---|---|---|
| Project maintainer | Is the code well-shaped and understandable? | [For Maintainability](book/src/to-contribute/coding-guidelines/for-maintainability/README.md) |
| Kernel developer | Is it correct and efficient? | [For Development](book/src/to-contribute/coding-guidelines/for-development/README.md) |
| Security expert | Is it safe and secure? | [For Security](book/src/to-contribute/coding-guidelines/for-security/README.md) |
| Hardware expert | Is it correct against the hardware contract? | [For Hardware](book/src/to-contribute/coding-guidelines/for-hardware/README.md) |
| Documentation writer | Are the user-facing docs well-written? | [For Documentation](book/src/to-contribute/coding-guidelines/for-documentation/README.md) |

## Architecture Notes

- **Framekernel:** The kernel is split into a safe upper half (`kernel/`)
  and an unsafe lower half (`ostd/`).
  This is a hard architectural boundary — never add `unsafe` to `kernel/`.
- **Components** (`kernel/comps/`): block, console, network, PCI, virtio, etc.
  Each is a separate crate.
