## Project Guidelines

**Purpose:**
This project is a web application which generates static HTML pages and serves them in a dynamic frontend

**Repo structure**
- Backend
    - Python
    - entry point is /backend/app.py
    - FastAPI uvicorn server
- Frontend
    - React with vite dev server
    - entry point is /frontend/src/App.tsx
    - tailwind css and shadcn

## Python Guidelines

We follow very particular formatting guidelines.
- always use type hints in function parameters. Put no space arount the colon, but always have space around equal signs
- break long lists of parameters or entries into one per line
- indent parentheses so that the closing one aligns with the name of the assigned variable
- dicts with a single entry can be written on one line. When defining an empty dict, add a comment with an example entry.
- use complete docstrings for helper functions that are called in multiple places. Include args and return values, omit exceptions.

Good example:
```python
def send_tts(self, message:str, speaker:str, cancel_upon_interruption:bool = True):
    self.send_message(
        event = Events.TTS_REQUEST,
        data = {
            "message": message,
            "speaker": speaker,
            "cancel": cancel_upon_interruption
        }
    )
```


## Frontend Guidelines

Apply similar formatting style to javascript and typescript files as described in the python section above.
