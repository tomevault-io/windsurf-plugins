# git-meta Engineering Guide

This is a reference implementation of the git-meta spec ([docs](https://git-meta.com/))

## Rust Style and Idioms

- Use traits only for real behaviour boundaries: multiple implementations, dependency inversion, or a clear test seam. Do not add traits just to make code look extensible.
- Derive `Default` when all fields have sensible defaults.
- Use concrete types (`struct`/`enum`) over `serde_json::Value` wherever shape is known.
- **Match on types, never strings.** Only convert to strings at serialization/display boundaries.
- Prefer `From`/`Into`/`TryFrom`/`TryInto` over manual conversions. Ask before adding manual conversion paths.
- **Forbidden:** `Mutex<()>` / `Arc<Mutex<()>>` — mutex must guard actual state.
- Use `anyhow::Result` for app errors, `thiserror` for library errors. Propagate with `?`.
- **Never `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` in production.** Workspace lints deny these. Use `?`, `ok_or_else`, `unwrap_or_default`, `unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())` for locks.
- Prefer `Option<T>` over sentinel values.
- Use `time` crate (workspace dep) for date/time — no manual epoch math or magic constants like `86400`.
- Prefer guard clauses (early returns) over nested `if` blocks.
- Prefer the clearest Rust. Iterators are good when they improve clarity; simple `for` loops are fine when they are easier to read. Use `Cow<'_, str>` when allocation is conditional and the added type complexity is worth it.
- **No banner/separator comments.** Do not use decorative divider comments like `// ── Section ───`. Use normal `//` comments or doc comments to explain *why*, not to visually partition files.

## Dependencies

- **Use `gix` (gitoxide), not `git2` (libgit2).** `gix` is the preferred Git library for this project. Do not introduce `git2` dependencies or suggest `git2`-based solutions. If existing code uses `git2`, prefer migrating it to `gix` when touching that code.

## Architecture and Design

- For public API code, include useful doc comments explaining purpose, invariants, errors, and examples when helpful. Avoid boilerplate docs that merely repeat names or types.
- Documentation and comments **must** be kept up-to-date with code changes.
- Do not re-discover Git repositories, instead take them as inputs to functions and methods.
- Avoid implicitly using the current time like `std::time::SystemTime::now()`, instead pass the current time as argument.
- Keep public API surfaces small. Use `#[must_use]` where return values matter.

## AI Code Review Pass

Before finishing generated Rust, review it as if it came from an overeager AI:

- Delete fake extensibility.
- Collapse one-use traits/types/functions.
- Rename generic concepts to domain concepts.
- Prefer passing explicit inputs over rediscovering state.
- Remove comments that describe what the next line already says.
- Keep error handling intentional: typed errors for library boundaries, `anyhow` for app/CLI boundaries.
- Preserve behavior; do not turn cleanup into a refactor.

## Testing

- All code must have an appropriate test coverage (proportionate to its complexity and criticality).
- Do not test external dependencies or trivial getters/setters.
- Create a mix of unit tests and end-to-end tests.
- Do not use `anyhow::ensure!` in tests; use panicking assertions (`assert!`, `assert_eq!`, `assert_ne!`) so failures are test panics.

## Committing and Version Control

- Prefer repository/library APIs over shelling out to `git` in production code. In tests, use project test helpers where available. Use the `git` CLI only when testing CLI interoperability or behavior that specifically depends on Git’s command-line semantics.
- When you are done making changes, always run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` and ensure no warnings remain.
