# VibeCraft Development Guide

You are working on the **VibeCraft codebase** - an AI-powered Minecraft WorldEdit MCP server.

> **Note:** This CLAUDE.md is for **developing** VibeCraft. To **use** VibeCraft as a building agent, run Claude Code from the `/agent` folder instead.

## Repository Structure

```
vibecraft/
├── agent/                    # VibeCraft AGENT files (run Claude from here to BUILD in Minecraft)
│   ├── .claude/skills/       # 7 building skills (worldedit, structures, terrain, etc.)
│   ├── context/              # AI reference guides (MD files agent reads)
│   ├── CLAUDE.md             # Agent system prompt
│   └── AGENTS.md             # Source for agent prompt (copied to CLAUDE.md)
│
├── mcp-server/               # MCP SERVER CODE (Python)
│   ├── src/vibecraft/

│   ├── pyproject.toml        # Dependencies
│   └── start-vibecraft.sh    # Server launcher

├── dev_docs/                 # Development documentation
├── docs/                     # User documentation
├── docker-compose.yml        # Minecraft server setup
└── setup-all.sh              # One-command setup
```

## Experimenting with VibeCraft

**The main way to experiment is by modifying the agent prompt and skills.**

Most development work happens in the `agent/` folder:

```bash
cd agent
claude  # Start Claude Code as the building agent
```

Then iterate on:
- **`agent/CLAUDE.md`** — The agent's system prompt (auto-generated from AGENTS.md)
- **`agent/.claude/skills/`** — Building skills that teach the agent specific workflows
- **`agent/context/`** — Reference materials the agent can read

**Workflow:**
1. Make changes to skills or prompts
2. Run `claude` in the `agent/` folder
3. Ask it to build something and observe behavior
4. Refine the instructions based on results

The MCP server code rarely needs changes unless you're adding new tools or fixing bugs.

## Key Development Areas

### MCP Server (`mcp-server/src/vibecraft/`)

The core Python server that provides MCP tools to AI clients.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `server.py` | Main entry, tool registration, MCP protocol |
| `tools/__init__.py` | Tool registry, handler dispatch |
| `tools/build_tools.py` | `build()` tool - batch command execution |
| `tools/core_tools.py` | RCON, WorldEdit generic handlers |
| `tools/worldedit_*.py` | WorldEdit-specific tools |
| `rcon_manager.py` | Minecraft RCON connection |
| `code_sandbox.py` | Safe Python execution for procedural builds |
| `tool_schemas.py` | MCP tool definitions and schemas |

### Agent Files (`agent/`)

Files consumed by the VibeCraft building agent.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/skills/` | Building skills with detailed workflows |
| `context/` | JSON catalogs (items, patterns, templates) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Master agent instructions (source for CLAUDE.md) |

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start Minecraft server
docker compose up -d

# Run MCP server (stdio mode)
cd mcp-server && uv run python -m src.vibecraft.server

# Run MCP server (HTTP/SSE mode for debugging)
cd mcp-server && ./start-vibecraft.sh

# Run tests
cd mcp-server && uv run pytest

# Type checking
cd mcp-server && uv run mypy src/

# Linting
cd mcp-server && uv run ruff check src/
```

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New MCP Tool

1. Define schema in `tool_schemas.py`
2. Create handler in `tools/` (or add to existing module)
3. Register in `tools/__init__.py` TOOL_REGISTRY
4. Update agent docs if user-facing

### Modifying WorldEdit Behavior

- `build_tools.py` handles `//` command auto-wrapping
- `core_tools.py` has `prepare_worldedit_command()` for single commands
- WorldEdit commands need `execute as <player> at @s run` wrapper

### Updating Agent Skills

Skills are in `agent/.claude/skills/`. Each skill has:
- `SKILL.md` - Main skill content (required)
- Optional supporting `.md` files

The skill description in YAML frontmatter controls when it triggers.

## Testing with Minecraft

1. Ensure Docker is running: `docker compose up -d`
2. Connect to server: `localhost:25565`
3. Player must be online for WorldEdit commands
4. Check logs: `docker compose logs -f minecraft`

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ with type hints
- Ruff for linting
- Async handlers for MCP tools
- Descriptive error messages for AI consumption

## Important Notes

- WorldEdit commands via RCON need player context (`execute as <player>`)
- Brush/tool commands don't work via RCON (require player interaction)
- The `build()` tool auto-wraps `//` commands with player context
- Always test changes with an actual Minecraft client connected
