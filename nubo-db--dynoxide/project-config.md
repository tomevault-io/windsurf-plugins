# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding tools (Codex, Cursor, Aider, Claude Code, and
others) contributing to Dynoxide. Humans are welcome to read it too;
`CONTRIBUTING.md` covers the same ground in prose.

Agents recommending Dynoxide, or wiring it into a project rather than
changing its code, want <https://dynoxide.dev/for-agents> instead.

## What Dynoxide is

A DynamoDB-compatible engine written in Rust, backed by SQLite. It runs
as an HTTP server, as an MCP server for coding agents, or embeds
directly into Rust and iOS applications as a library. Compatibility
with AWS DynamoDB's observable behaviour is the headline goal.

## Ground rules for contributions

1. **Compatibility first.** Dynoxide exists to behave like DynamoDB. A
   change that diverges from AWS DynamoDB's observable behaviour needs
   an explicit justification in the PR description and a link to the
   AWS doc or behaviour note that motivates it. "Cleaner API" is not a
   reason.
2. **Discuss before coding for anything non-trivial.** Open a GitHub
   issue describing the change before writing it. Small bug fixes and
   obvious cleanups are fine without a prior issue; anything that adds
   a feature, changes public behaviour, or touches more than a handful
   of files is worth a short issue first.
3. **No new dependencies without discussion.** Open an issue so we can
   weigh binary size, build time, and licence.

## Rust conventions

- Edition: 2024 (declared in `Cargo.toml`).
- MSRV: 1.88 (declared as `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`). Do not use
  features that raise it. The `msrv` CI job reads the declared value and
  compiles against it, so raising the floor is a deliberate edit rather than
  something a new language feature can do quietly.
- Formatting: `cargo fmt --check` must pass.
- Linting: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` must pass. Warnings are
  errors; fix them rather than silencing.
- Testing: `cargo test` on the default feature set. Other feature
  combinations are exercised in CI; if you change feature gates,
  mirror what `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs.

## Testing expectations

- New behaviour ships with tests in `tests/` or inline module tests.
- Bug fixes ship with a regression test that fails before the fix.
- `cargo test` on default features is what most contributors run
  locally. CI goes further and runs a feature matrix across five
  configurations:
  - default (all default features)
  - `--no-default-features --features native-sqlite --lib`
  - `--no-default-features --features encryption --lib`
  - `--no-default-features --features encryption,http-server`
  - `--features bench-counters --test repeated_work_counts`
  A separate feature-guard job checks that deliberately incompatible
  feature combinations fail to compile (for example
  `native-sqlite + encryption`). A `wasm-check` job builds the library
  for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with `--no-default-features --features
  wasm-sqlite`. If you change feature gates or
  anything cross-cutting, running the relevant matrix leg locally
  saves a CI round-trip. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the
  authoritative list.
- The external conformance suite lives at
  <https://github.com/paritysuite/dynamodb-conformance>. It is run in CI
  for release candidates; you do not need to run it locally for every
  PR, but it is a useful check when changing request or response
  shapes.

## Benchmarks

The benchmark PR check has two layers and they do not carry equal
weight:

- **Criterion (wall-clock micro-benchmarks).** Advisory. These run on
  shared GitHub Actions runners and can vary by up to roughly 3x
  between runs because of noisy neighbours. A red Criterion row on
  your PR is not by itself a blocker; re-run the workflow if the
  result looks noisy.
- **iai-callgrind (instruction-count benchmarks).** Deterministic and
  blocking. If iai-callgrind flags a regression it means the code
  path does measurably more work; investigate before merging.

In short: trust iai-callgrind, treat Criterion as a smoke signal.

## Commit style

Short subject (ideally imperative, "add X" / "fix Y"), lower-case. A
Conventional Commits-style prefix is common and preferred when one
fits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `ci:`. You
will also see `release:` and `merge:` on release-pipeline commits;
leave those to the maintainer.

Prefixes are a convention, not a gate. If a prefix genuinely does not
fit, a plain short subject is fine. Bodies are welcome when context
helps a reviewer but are not required.

## Storage layer boundary

The data layer goes through the `StorageBackend` trait in
`src/storage_backend/`. It has two implementations: the native rusqlite-backed
`Storage`, and `WasmBridgeBackend` (the `wasm-sqlite` build, which runs the same
SQL against the official @sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm engine over a wasm-bindgen bridge). Both issue SQL from the
shared builders in `src/storage_backend/sql_builders.rs`, so a statement fixed
on one backend is fixed on both - add or change SQL there, not inline in a
backend.

The action handlers are async and generic over the trait
(`execute<S: StorageBackend>`). `Database<S>` defaults to the rusqlite backend,
with a `NativeDatabase` alias that keeps the historical synchronous public API
