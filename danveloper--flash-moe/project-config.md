# Flash-MoE: Running a 397B Parameter Model on a Laptop

> **[Read the paper](paper/flash_moe.pdf)** — Full technical details, 90+ experiments, and the story of how an AI and a human built this in 24 hours.

Pure C/Metal inference engine that runs **Qwen3.5-397B-A17B** (a 397 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model) on a MacBook Pro with 48GB RAM at **4.4+ tokens/second** with production-quality output including tool calling.

The entire 209GB model streams from SSD through a custom Metal compute pipeline. No Python. No frameworks. Just C, Objective-C, and hand-tuned Metal shaders.

## Results

![Progress](progress.png)

| Configuration | tok/s | Quality | Notes |
|--------------|-------|---------|-------|
| 4-bit experts, FMA kernel | **4.36** | Excellent | Current best. Full tool calling. 209GB on disk. |
| 4-bit experts, baseline | 3.90 | Excellent | Before FMA kernel optimization. |
| 2-bit experts, trust OS | 5.74 | Good* | 120GB on disk. *Breaks JSON/tool calling. |
| 2-bit peak single token | 7.05 | Good* | Warm cache burst. *Not suitable for tool use. |

*2-bit quantization produces `\name\` instead of `"name"` in JSON output, making tool calling unreliable. 4-bit is the production configuration.

## Hardware

- **Machine**: MacBook Pro, Apple M3 Max
- **Chip**: 16-core CPU (12P + 4E), 40-core GPU, 16-core ANE
- **Memory**: 48 GB unified (~400 GB/s bandwidth)
- **SSD**: 1TB Apple Fabric, **17.5 GB/s sequential read** (measured)
- **macOS**: 26.2 (Darwin 25.2.0)

## Architecture

The model has 60 transformer layers: 45 GatedDeltaNet (linear attention) + 15 standard full attention. Each layer has 512 experts, of which K=4 are activated per token (plus one shared expert). Hidden dimension is 4096.

### Key Techniques

1. **SSD Expert Streaming** — Expert weights (209GB at 4-bit) are read from NVMe SSD on demand via parallel `pread()` with GCD dispatch groups. Only the K=4 active experts per layer are loaded (~6.75MB each). The OS page cache manages caching — no custom cache needed ("Trust the OS" principle). Inspired by Apple's "LLM in a Flash" paper.

2. **FMA-Optimized Dequant Kernel** — The inner loop of the 4-bit dequantized matrix-vector multiply rearranges the math from `(nibble * scale + bias) * x` to `fma(nibble, scale*x, bias*x)`. Pre-computing `scale*x` and `bias*x` lets the GPU fused multiply-add unit do dequant+multiply in one instruction. 12% faster than the naive formulation.

3. **Metal Compute Shaders** — Hand-written Metal kernels for:
   - 4-bit and 2-bit dequantized matrix-vector multiply (tiled, SIMD-reduced, shared input cache, FMA-optimized)
   - Fused SwiGLU activation
   - RMS normalization (two-pass: sum-of-squares reduction + apply)
   - Batched GPU attention (Q@K^T, softmax, scores@V) for full attention layers
   - GPU RoPE (fused with Q deinterleave and K normalization)
   - MoE combine + residual + sigmoid gate (fused kernel)

4. **Deferred GPU Expert Compute** — CMD3 (expert forward pass) is submitted without waiting. The GPU executes it while the CPU prepares the next layer. The combine + residual + norm are also on GPU, feeding directly into the next layer's attention projections.

5. **Accelerate BLAS for Linear Attention** — The GatedDeltaNet recurrence uses `cblas_sscal`, `cblas_sgemv`, and `cblas_sger` for the 64-head × 128×128 state matrix update. 64% faster than scalar code.

6. **Trust the OS** — No custom expert cache. The OS page cache (~35GB) manages expert data caching via standard LRU. Every custom caching approach we tested (Metal LRU, malloc cache, LZ4 compressed cache) was slower due to GPU memory pressure or overhead. The page cache achieves ~71% hit rate naturally.

### Pipeline Per Layer (4.28ms average at 4-bit)

```
CMD3(prev) → CMD1: attention projections + delta-net  [1.22ms GPU]
           → CPU: flush results                       [0.01ms CPU]
           → CMD2: o_proj + norm + routing + shared    [0.55ms GPU]
           → CPU: softmax + topK routing               [0.003ms]
           → I/O: parallel pread K=4 experts           [2.41ms SSD]
           → CMD3: expert forward + combine + norm     [0.04ms encode, DEFERRED]
```

### Unified Memory Constraint

On Apple Silicon, SSD DMA and GPU compute share the same memory controller and cannot be profitably overlapped. The GPU's dequant kernels are bandwidth-saturated at ~418 GiB/s. Even small background SSD DMA causes disproportionate GPU latency spikes through memory controller arbitration. The serial pipeline (GPU → SSD → GPU) is hardware-optimal.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd metal_infer
make
# 4-bit inference (needs packed_experts/ directory)
./infer --prompt "Explain quantum computing" --tokens 100

# 2-bit inference (faster but breaks tool calling)
./infer --prompt "Explain quantum computing" --tokens 100 --2bit

# Interactive chat with tool calling
./chat

# Per-layer timing breakdown
./infer --prompt "Hello" --tokens 20 --timing
```

## Project Structure

```
metal_infer/
  infer.m              # Complete inference engine (~7000 lines)
  shaders.metal        # Metal compute kernels (~1200 lines)
  chat.m               # Interactive chat TUI with tool calling
