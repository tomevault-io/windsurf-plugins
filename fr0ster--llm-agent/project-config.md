## Language Requirements
All repository artifacts authored by the assistant (source code, documentation, comments, commit messages, etc.) must be written in English.

Direct communication with the user must follow the language used by the user in the current conversation.

## Project Context
- **Name:** LLM Agent – Minimal LLM agent orchestrating MCP tools through SAP AI Core.
- **Purpose:** Acts as an orchestrator between LLM providers and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
- **Key Architecture:** All LLM providers are accessed through SAP AI Core (not directly).
- **Key Modules:** `src/agents/`, `src/llm-providers/`, `src/mcp/`, `src/types.ts`

## Code Standards
- Source code: English only
- Comments: English only, explain "why" not "what"
- Variable/function/class names: English only
- Error messages: English only
- Log messages: English only

## Architecture Notes
- SAP AI Core is the primary gateway for all LLM providers
- Supports multiple transport protocols: Stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP
- Auto-detection of transport from URL
