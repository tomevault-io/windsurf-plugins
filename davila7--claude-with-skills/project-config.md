# claude-with-skills

A progressive course teaching Agent Skills for Claude Code, from anatomy to advanced orchestration patterns.

## Repository layout

```
src/content/docs/         # All course content (also served as a Starlight site)
  00-introduction/        # Conceptual foundation (what skills are, how they load)
  01-basic/               # Anatomy, scopes, repetitive tasks, documentation, invocation
  02-intermediate/        # Full frontmatter reference, arguments, dynamic context, combining options
  03-advanced/            # Forked context, subagent wiring, orchestration, hooks, plugins, capstone
  reference/              # Cheatsheets: frontmatter, substitutions, invocation matrix, headless, troubleshooting
scripts/                  # install-examples.sh — copies a skill directory into personal or project scope
astro.config.mjs          # Starlight site config (sidebar, base path)
src/content.config.ts     # Content collection schema (extends Starlight to accept SKILL.md fields)
```

Each numbered section contains:
- `index.md` — learning objectives and lesson index (rendered at `/NN-<section>/`)
- `lesson-NN-<topic>/index.md` — concept explanation
- `lesson-NN-<topic>/examples/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — runnable skill
- `exercises/` — prompts with `solutions/` subdirectory

`README.md` files at section/lesson roots were renamed to `index.md` so Starlight maps them to clean URLs. `SKILL.md` files keep their name because `scripts/install-examples.sh` requires it.

## SKILL.md conventions

Every `SKILL.md` must have valid YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name          # lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars, matches directory name
description: ...          # plain text, max 1024 chars, written for the model not for humans
---
```

- Names: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens only. No underscores.
- Descriptions: written so Claude can decide at startup whether to activate the skill — not marketing copy.
- Body: keep under 500 lines / 5000 tokens. Move reference material to `references/` subdirectories.
- Claude Code-specific fields (`disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `argument-hint`, `arguments`, `paths`, `shell`, `context`, `agent`, `hooks`, `model`, `effort`) are documented in `src/content/docs/reference/frontmatter-cheatsheet.md`.
- Course pages must include a `title:` field in their frontmatter (Starlight requirement). For `SKILL.md`, this sits alongside the existing `name:` and `description:` fields; Claude Code ignores extra frontmatter keys.

## Installing and testing an example

```bash
# Install a skill into personal scope (~/.claude/skills/)
bash scripts/install-examples.sh src/content/docs/01-basic/lesson-01-anatomy/examples/hello-skill personal

# Install into project scope (.claude/skills/ in CWD)
bash scripts/install-examples.sh src/content/docs/01-basic/lesson-01-anatomy/examples/hello-skill project

# Test interactively
claude
# then: /hello-skill

# Test headless
claude -p "/hello-skill"
```

## Adding content

- Every example skill must be immediately runnable after `bash scripts/install-examples.sh`. No placeholders, no TODOs.
- Every new lesson directory needs an `index.md` with a `title:` frontmatter field.
- When adding a new lesson page, also register it in the sidebar at `astro.config.mjs`.
- Python scripts in `scripts/` subdirectories of examples should be standard library + minimal dependencies (pypdf is the only approved third-party dependency currently in use).
- The `__pycache__` directories are covered by `.gitignore`; do not commit them.
- Commit messages: English, imperative mood, one logical change per commit.

## Running the site locally

```bash
npm install        # one-time
npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321/
npm run build      # static output in dist/
```

## Key reference files

- `src/content/docs/reference/frontmatter-cheatsheet.md` — all fields, portability column, invocation matrix
- `src/content/docs/reference/substitution-variables.md` — `$ARGUMENTS`, `$N`, `$name`, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`, `${CLAUDE_EFFORT}`
- `src/content/docs/reference/headless-mode.md` — `claude -p` patterns and CI recipes
- `src/content/docs/reference/troubleshooting.md` — skill not found, budget overflow, `/doctor`
- `src/content/docs/00-introduction/progressive-disclosure.md` — the 3-stage load model (when to use `references/`)
