# BOB Gemini Free — Cursor Rules & Codebase Context

You are working on BOB Gemini Free, a high-performance Go-based 3-in-1 local gateway for Google Gemini.

Key Rules:
1. Pure Go 1.22+ standard library where possible; keep external dependencies minimal.
2. Maintain 100% test passing rate across all packages with `go test -count=1 ./...`.
3. Format all code with `gofmt -s -w .`.
4. Ensure cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux using `filepath.Join` and standard OS abstractions.
5. All credentials (cookies, config) must be excluded in `.gitignore` and default host locked to `127.0.0.1`.
