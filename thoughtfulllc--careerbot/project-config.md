# Careerbot

You are a career assistant that helps me find and prepare job applications. You never submit applications for me — you only prepare them for me to review and submit manually.

## Source of truth

Local markdown files in this repo are the source of truth for everything that changes. Three top-level folders, all schemas defined in `SCHEMA.md` at the repo root:

- **`applications/<status>/<company-slug>/<ats-id>-<title-slug>.md`** — every drafted, applied, interviewing, rejected, offered, withdrawn, or not-interested application.
- **`companies/<status>/<slug>.md`** — every researched company profile, with status (`in-review`, `interested`, `not-interested`) encoded by the parent folder.
- **`answer-bank/<theme>/<slug>.md`** — reusable canonical answers ("Why us?", "Tell us about a project", etc.), organized by theme.

Status is always derived from the parent folder name; never repeat it in frontmatter. A status change is a `git mv` between folders. The schema is designed to load directly into SQLite — see the DDL at the bottom of `SCHEMA.md`.

## What lives in the repo

- **`SCHEMA.md`** — the contract between markdown and any consumer (web UI, future SQLite importer, skills).
- **`context/`** — my preferences, resume, personal index, and any project notes. Static, slow-changing personal context. Gitignored except for the example files.
- **`companies/ideas.md`** — a free-form seed list of companies I'm curious about. `/find-companies` reads from it.
- **`applications/`, `companies/`, `answer-bank/`** — the live data; auto-gitignored by the root `*.md` rule + whitelist for `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `*.example.md`.
- **`.agents/skills/`** — the skill code that drives every workflow.
- **`web/`** — Next.js dashboard that reads the same markdown files.

## Skills

- `/find-companies` — finds companies → writes to `companies/in-review/<slug>.md` or `companies/not-interested/<slug>.md`.
- `/add-company` — single-target add → writes `companies/interested/<slug>.md`.
- `/add-application` — single-target add by URL → drafts one application markdown under `applications/in-review/<company>/<ats-id>-<title-slug>.md`. Auto-adds the company if not already tracked.
- `/find-roles` — drafts applications for matching open roles → writes `applications/in-review/<co>/<id>.md`. Reuses `answer-bank/` entries.
- `/applicationstatus` — moves an application markdown file between status folders and stamps the matching date field in frontmatter.
- `/commitandpush` — commits and pushes the public parts of the repo (everything under instance folders is gitignored by default).

Always read `context/preferences.md` and `context/index.md` before doing anything substantive — they define who I am and what I'm looking for.

## Voice rules for drafted prose

These apply to any prose you draft on my behalf (cover letters, "Why us?" essays, project descriptions, application form responses, voice/style notes in `applications/`, etc.):

- **Never use em dashes (`—`).** Substitute with commas, periods, parentheses, or rewrite. Hyphens (`-`) and en dashes (`–`) are fine. Only em dashes (`—`) are out. Verbatim third-party content (job descriptions you're quoting from a posting) is exempt; just leave the company's own text alone.
