# AI Lægens Bord

## Project Goal

This project builds a set of AI skills for personal health assistance in Denmark. The skills enable AI agents to:

- Navigate **sundhed.dk** (Denmark's public health portal) to access health records, lab results, medications, and more
- Search and summarize **medical research** from sources like PubMed, Lægehåndbogen, and pro.medicin.dk
- Look up **medication information** including interactions, side effects, and dosages

The deliverable is a collection of reusable Claude Code skills that any AI agent can invoke to help users understand and navigate their health information. This is a helper tool, not a replacement for medical advice.

## Tech Stack

- **Playwright CLI** for all browser automation. ONLY use the CLI commands (`playwright-cli open`, `playwright-cli snapshot`, `playwright-cli click`, etc.) - NEVER write Playwright scripts or use the Playwright Node.js API directly.
- **Claude Code Skills** as the packaging format for each capability
- **Node.js** for parser scripts that convert raw JSON into agent-readable markdown and SQLite
- **SQLite** (Node.js built-in `node:sqlite`) for structured, queryable health data storage - single file, no server needed

    parsed/                         # LLM-friendly markdown output
      *.md                          # 11 parsed markdown files

  README.md                         # Explains the data directory (committed)
```

## Key Conventions

- **Data goes in `data/`** - All personal health data is stored in `data/sundhed-dk/`. This directory is gitignored. Never commit personal data.
- **Two output formats** - Markdown files (`parsed/*.md`) for dumping into LLM context; SQLite database (`health.db`) for targeted queries across time.
- **Check for existing data first** - Before opening a browser, check if `data/sundhed-dk/health.db` or `parsed/*.md` already exist. Only fetch from sundhed.dk if data is missing or the user wants a refresh.
- **Parsers live with the skill** - Parser scripts are bundled inside `.claude/skills/sundhed-dk/parsers/` so the skill is self-contained.
- **Browser must be headed** - sundhed.dk requires MitID login, which needs manual user interaction. Always use `--headed --persistent` flags.
- **Intercept, don't scrape** - Health data is fetched by intercepting JSON API responses, not by scraping HTML.
- **Prøvesvar date range** - Lab results default to 6 months. For historical data, change the date filter URL parameter (e.g. `datoFra=10-02-2022`) before intercepting.

## Creating Skills

Skills follow the Claude Code skill format. Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions. See the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for the full reference.
