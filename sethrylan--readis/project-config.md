## Project Overview

Readis is a TUI Redis browser written in Go, built with [Charm](https://charm.sh/) (Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, Glamour) and inspired by RedisInsight.

- **Language:** Go (version specified in `go.mod`)
- **Entry point:** `cmd/readis/main.go`
- **Structure:** `internal/data` (Redis data layer), `internal/ui` (TUI components), `internal/util` (utilities)

## Building and Running

```sh
go build ./cmd/readis
go run cmd/readis/main.go
```

## Testing

```sh
go test -race ./...
```

Tests use [testcontainers-go](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go) with a Redis module, so Docker must be available to run the full test suite.

## Linting

```sh
golangci-lint run
```

Linting is configured in `.golangci.yml`. Linters are set to `default: all` with specific linters disabled. Test files have relaxed rules for `gosec`, `errcheck`, and dot-imports. Run `go mod tidy` before submitting changes.

## Code Style and Conventions

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms.
- Dot imports are allowed in test files (for testify).
- US English spelling is enforced by the `misspell` linter.
- Commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification (e.g., `feat: add feature`, `fix: resolve bug`).

### Testing Conventions

- Use `t.Context()` instead of `context.Background()` or `context.TODO()` to obtain a context in tests. This context is automatically cancelled when the test completes.
- Use `t.Setenv()` instead of `os.Setenv()` to set environment variables in tests. This automatically restores the original value when the test completes.
- Use `t.Cleanup()` to register cleanup functions instead of `defer` when the cleanup should run after the test and all its subtests complete.

## CI/CD

CI runs on every push and PR to `main` via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

1. **Lint** — runs `golangci-lint`
2. **Test** — runs `go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`

### Additional Workflows

- **Conventional Commits** — PR titles must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
- **Dependabot Auto-merge** — Patch and minor dependency updates from Dependabot are auto-approved and squash-merged.
- **Release** — Triggered by pushing a `v*.*.*` tag. Uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to build and publish binaries for Linux and macOS.

## PR Guidelines

- PR titles must follow the Conventional Commits format (e.g., `feat: add feature`, `fix: resolve bug`).
- Ensure `go mod tidy`, `golangci-lint run`, and `go test -race ./...` all pass before submitting.
