# Guidance for Claude Code

Working notes for anyone driving this repo through Claude Code. Skim, don't memorize — every rule here links out to the deeper doc.

## Repo layout

This is a meta-repo with two top-level directories:

- `product-sdk/` — the workspace where all packages live. Cd into here before running any `pnpm` command.
- `docs/` — the documentation site, deployed separately.

Inside `product-sdk/`:

- `product-sdk/packages/*` — published `@parity/product-sdk-*` packages. Edit here for any consumer-visible change.
- `product-sdk/examples/*` — demo apps + Playwright e2e specs. Not published.
- `product-sdk/skills/*` — product-API knowledge, consumed by Claude Code via the `Skill` tool. Add a skill when there's reusable "how to use this part of the SDK" content.
- `product-sdk/pending-changesets/` — changesets parked while their PR is still in flight. See [`product-sdk/pending-changesets/README.md`](./product-sdk/pending-changesets/README.md).
- `product-sdk/.changeset/` — changesets ready to ship on the next merge to `main`.
- `product-sdk/RELEASES.md` — the canonical release / changeset doc. Read this before authoring a changeset.

## Build / test / lint

Run from `product-sdk/`:

```bash
pnpm install                                  # workspace install
pnpm -r build                                 # build every package
pnpm -r test                                  # run every package's unit tests
pnpm check                                    # biome lint + format check (this is what CI runs)
pnpm format                                   # auto-fix format issues
pnpm test:e2e                                 # all e2e demos under examples/*

pnpm --filter "@parity/product-sdk-host" build
pnpm --filter "@parity/product-sdk-signer" test
```

For e2e on a single demo: `pnpm --filter "@parity/product-sdk-tx-demo" test:e2e`.

## Changesets

Every PR that changes a published artifact needs a changeset. See [`product-sdk/RELEASES.md#when-does-a-pr-need-a-changeset`](./product-sdk/RELEASES.md#when-does-a-pr-need-a-changeset) for the exact criteria. Three important quirks:

- Park your changeset in `pending-changesets/`, not `.changeset/` — anything under `.changeset/` ships on the next merge to `main`, even if the PR that created it is unfinished. Leave it there; your PR never moves it.
- **A separate `chore(release):` PR promotes the ready changesets into `.changeset/` and cuts the release wave.** Feature PRs don't promote. CI enforces this with the `product-sdk: Changeset location` check.
- When any constituent gets a `minor` bump, **also list `@parity/product-sdk` as `minor`** in the same changeset. Otherwise the umbrella cascades only at patch level.

## PR workflow

- **Catching a branch up to `main`**: prefer `git pull origin main` over `git rebase main`. Rebase forces a force-push that desyncs anyone else who has the branch checked out, which is a real coordination cost on a shared repo.
- **CI is authoritative.** Some tests fail on darwin due to ESM-resolution quirks in transitive deps that don't reproduce on Linux. If CI is green and a local test fails, treat it as an environmental issue, not a blocker.
- **Run `pnpm check` before pushing.** Only run `pnpm format` if `pnpm check` actually flags something — don't preemptively reformat after an unrelated change.
- **Don't commit without being asked** — same default as Claude Code's general rule.

## Codebase gotchas

- **`product-sdk/packages/host/src/truapi.ts` is not `@parity/truapi`.** Despite the name, this file is the host package's accessor + convenience wrappers around the in-house `@parity/truapi` client (built and cached by `transport.ts`); `getTruApi()` returns its `TrUApiClient` and the exported `TruApi` type aliases that. Other `@parity/product-sdk-*` packages consume the ergonomic facades from here rather than importing `@parity/truapi` directly.
- **`product-sdk/packages/descriptors/chains/*/generated/`** is gitignored. Don't try to read or edit it — it's emitted by `pnpm generate` and packed at publish time. Source of truth is the per-chain `.papi/polkadot-api.json`.
- **CHANGELOG files are historical.** A mass rename (e.g. of a dep) should not sweep them — the names that were current at release time should stay frozen.
- **e2e specs may carry `TODO(truapi-migration)` skips.** These are real and load-bearing — track them via the open issue rather than randomly unskipping.
- **The umbrella `@parity/product-sdk` package re-exports many smaller packages.** A bundle-size measurement on the umbrella reflects the transitive graph of everything it touches, not its own code.
