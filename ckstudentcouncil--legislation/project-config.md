# Project Overview

**CKSC Legislation (cksc-legislation)** is the central repository and platform for organizing and securely displaying the constitution, laws, orders, and documents for the Student Council of Chien Kuo High School (CKHS). This Vue 3 + Quasar framework web application acts as the authoritative portal for the school's legislative documentation, connecting directly to a Firebase/Firestore backend and utilizing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO and performance alongside Firebase App Hosting/Cloud Run.

## Repository Structure

- **`.apphosting/`** - Firebase App Hosting templates and service configurations for deploying to Cloud Run.
- **`.github/`** - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for building, checking PRs, and deploying on merge.
- **`functions/`** - Firebase Cloud Functions backend logic (Node.js/TypeScript) for emails, sitemap generation, and API integrations.
- **`public/`** - Static assets like `favicon.ico` hosted at the root without compilation.
- **`src/`** - Main Vue 3 + Quasar application source code containing UI components, pages, routing, and pinia stores.
- **`src-ssr/`** - Specific custom middleware implementations for Quasar's Server-Side Rendering mechanism.
- **`firebase.json`** - Main Firebase configuration linking Hosting rewrites, Cloud Functions, and pointing to local Firestore rules and indexes.
- **`firestore.rules`** - Defines critical security access conditions, separating internal confidential documents from public archives based on User UID and assigned roles.
- **`firestore.indexes.json`** - Enforces required compound document queries efficiently for the database.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies (requires Node.js 18-24)
yarn install

# Start local development server with Hot Module Replacement + SSR enabled
yarn dev

# Run ESLint to check for stylistic or logical errors
yarn lint

# Format code automatically using Prettier
yarn format

# Build a production-ready SSR application bundle
yarn build

# Build a purely client-side SPA (Single Page Application)
yarn spa-build

# Prepare SSR build specifically for GCP build environments
yarn gcp-build
```

_(Note: Test scripts are currently stubbed in `package.json` with no explicit test runner defined natively)_

## Code Style & Conventions

- **Framework:** Vue 3 using the `<script setup>` Composition API with TypeScript.
- **Styling & Components:** Utilize Quasar Framework components (`q-*`) combined with SCSS modules via `src/app.scss`.
- **Linting Customizations:** Standard TypeScript/Vue configurations with custom exceptions: `any` typing and `unused-vars` are explicitly allowed/disabled per `eslint.config.js`. Avoid explicitly writing `debugger` statements in production.
- **Formatting:** Entire codebase relies on Prettier for uniform consistent styling. Always run `yarn format` before commits.

## Architecture Notes

```mermaid

    Client[Web Client (Vue 3 / Quasar SPA)]
    SSRServer[SSR Middleware (Cloud Run / Node.js)]
    Auth[Firebase Auth (Google OAuth)]
    DB[(Firestore)]
    CF[Cloud Functions]
    EmailAPI[Nodemailer / External Mails]

    Client <-->|Interacts| SSRServer
    SSRServer <-->|Reads Data / Queries| DB
    Client <-->|Logs in| Auth
    Auth -.->|Updates Custom Claims| CF
    CF -->|Emails & Backend Jobs| EmailAPI
    CF -->|Reads/Writes| DB
```

- **Data Flow**: The Vue UI leverages `vuefire` to synchronise real-time document collections. Static meta rendering is managed in SSR middleware prior to hitting the client browser.
- **Access Control**: Client identity maps through Firebase Auth -> Token Claims (Managed by custom Cloud Functions based on database assignments) -> enforced linearly at the `.rules` level before payload reaches the front-end.

## Testing Strategy

> TODO: Add testing strategy. No current testing frameworks (e.g. Vitest, Cypress, Jest) are presently configured in this application structure or CI pipelines.

## Security & Compliance

- **Database Rules**: Do **not** bypass existing logic inside `firestore.rules`. Confidential documents enforce strict read checks explicitly matching `viewers`, `authorUid`, and `declassifyAt` time checks against the user. Unauthenticated clients are rigidly blocked from non-public archives.
- **Auth Claims**: System privileges (`Chairman`, `Speaker`, etc.) are attached contextually via Custom Claims inside auth JSON tokens.
- **Deployment**: The GitHub workflow runs direct deployments. Access keys & Service Accounts must be securely loaded via `${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CKSC_LEGISLATION }}`.

## Agent Guardrails

- **DO NOT** edit code inside `node_modules` or `dist`.
- **DO NOT** commit untested or syntactically broken changes to `firestore.rules`; verify rules syntax offline when modifying `canReadDocument`.
