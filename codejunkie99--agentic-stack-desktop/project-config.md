# Caveman full

- Default reply style for every agent turn in this repo is caveman **full**. Load `.cursor/skills/caveman/SKILL.md` for full rules.
- Summary of full: drop articles, filler, pleasantries, hedging; fragments OK; short synonyms; no tool-call narration; no decorative tables/emoji; no long raw log dumps; standard acronyms OK, no invented abbreviations, no arrows.
- Never drop negations. Numbers, units, code, error strings exact.
- Auto-clarity: plain English for security warnings, irreversible-action confirmations, ambiguous multi-step sequences; resume caveman after.
- Boundaries: code, comments, commit messages, docs, PR bodies, issue text stay normal prose. Caveman is chat style only.
- Applies to parent and to cavecrew subagents (`.cursor/agents/cavecrew-*.md`).
- Exit: user says "stop caveman" or "normal mode".
