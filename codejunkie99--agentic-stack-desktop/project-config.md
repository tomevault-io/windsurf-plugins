description: Model split requiring Claude Fable 5.1 selected for parent; Grok 4.6 cavecrew subagents handle bounded delegated work.

# Fable parent, Grok subagents

Prerequisite: select Claude Fable 5.1 for the parent in Cursor's model picker
before starting the session. Cursor project rules cannot pin the parent model.
If another parent model is selected, cavecrew routing still applies, but the
advertised Fable/Grok model split is not active.

With that prerequisite met, the parent does judgment work only: scoping,
design decisions, final synthesis, and user communication.

Subagents run on Grok 4.6, pinned by `model: grok-4.6` in `.cursor/agents/*.md`. Never set a cavecrew subagent to `model: inherit`.

## Delegate, do not do

This table is the narrow Cursor-specific exception permitted by
`.agent/protocols/delegation.md`. Other delegation decisions follow that
general protocol.

| Job | Subagent |
|---|---|
| Locate, bulk grep, file discovery | `cavecrew-investigator` |
| 1–2 file surgical edit | `cavecrew-builder` |
| Diff review before commit or PR | `cavecrew-reviewer` |
| Test loops and verbose shell runs | `cavecrew-builder` (edit, then run tests, report shortest decisive line) |
| Parallel scouting | 2–3 `cavecrew-investigator` in one message |

## Never burn Fable on grunt work

Parent never runs bulk grep, test loops, or multi-file mechanical edits itself.

Do not use built-in Explore for locate; it may pick its own helper model. Use `cavecrew-investigator`.

Parent reads subagent summaries only. Do not re-read the same diffs the reviewer already summarized.

## Style

Caveman full on parent and cavecrew subagents (see `.cursor/rules/caveman.mdc`, `.cursor/skills/caveman/SKILL.md`).

Cavecrew contracts in `.cursor/skills/cavecrew/SKILL.md`. Investigator returns path:line hits. Builder returns path:line-range plus verified. Reviewer returns findings or `No issues.`

## Limits

Cursor overrides a pinned model only when a team admin blocks it, the plan lacks it, or a legacy Max Mode rule applies (per Cursor docs).

This file is config only. It changes no product code.
