## Rules for AI Agents

1. **Test your own work** - Never ask the user to test for you. Run automated tests
   (unit tests, integration tests, Playwright E2E tests) to verify changes work
   correctly before reporting completion. Use Playwright to paste md2cb output
   into the Froala editor (localhost:9090) to verify clipboard output renders correctly.

2. **Use existing tools** - Don't implement custom parsers or converters when
   established crates/libraries exist. Search crates.io for existing solutions first.

3. **Verify in real environment** - For clipboard/paste functionality, actually test
   the output in the target editor (localhost:9090) using Playwright, not just unit tests.

## Project Purpose

`md2cb` is a cross-platform command-line tool that converts GitHub Flavored
Markdown (GFM) to rich HTML clipboard content. The goal is to produce clipboard
output that rich text editors can properly render with GitHub-style formatting.

This enables users to paste formatted markdown into rich text editors like
Microsoft Word, Teams, Slack, Google Docs, Apple Pages, etc., with proper
styling preserved.

## Architecture

The tool is written in Rust for cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux).
**Single binary with no external runtime dependencies.**

1. **Markdown → HTML**: Uses `comrak` crate (GFM-compliant CommonMark parser)
2. **Math → PNG Images**: Uses embedded MathJax (via QuickJS) + resvg for LaTeX → SVG → PNG
3. **Mermaid → PNG Images**: Uses `mermaid-rs-renderer` (pure Rust) + resvg for diagrams → SVG → PNG
4. **Image Inlining**: Fetches images and embeds as base64 data URIs
5. **CSS Embedding**: GitHub markdown CSS embedded at compile time
6. **Clipboard**: Uses `arboard` crate for cross-platform HTML clipboard support

### Why PNG Images for Math?

Rich text editors (Froala, Word, Google Docs, etc.) sanitize pasted HTML:
- **KaTeX HTML** gets stripped (CSS classes removed, nested spans flattened)
- **MathML** is not rendered by most editors
- **SVG** data URIs are blocked by many editors
- **PNG images** are universally supported

## Development

### Prerequisites

- mise (tool/task manager) - https://mise.jdx.dev
- Docker (for dev server)

Run `mise install` to install Rust, Node.js, pnpm, and markserv.
Run `pnpm install` to install Node.js dependencies (playwright, mathjax, etc.).

### Tasks (via mise)

```bash
mise run build        # Build release binary
mise run test         # Run tests
mise run lint         # Run clippy linter
mise run format       # Format code
mise run dev          # Start dev servers and open in browser
mise run dev-stop     # Stop servers
mise run install      # Install to /usr/local/bin
mise run e2e          # Run E2E tests (FILTER=pattern to filter)
```

- **http://localhost:9090** - Rich text editor (Froala) for paste testing
- **http://localhost:9091/demo.md** - Markdown preview with MarkServ

### Workflow

1. Edit `src/parser.rs` or other source files
2. Run `mise run build` to rebuild
3. Test with `cat test/demo.md | ./md2cb`
4. Paste into the editor at localhost:9090 to verify output
5. Run `mise run test` to ensure all tests pass

## Supported Markdown Features

- Headers (H1-H6)
- Tables with column alignment (left/center/right)
- Task lists (checkboxes)
- Nested lists (ordered and unordered)
- Fenced code blocks with language classes
- Blockquotes
- Horizontal rules
- Links (inline, reference-style, auto-links)
- Images with alt text and title (auto-inlined as base64)
- Bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code
- **Math** - inline (`$...$`) and display (`$$...$$`) rendered as PNG images via MathJax
- **Mermaid diagrams** - flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc. rendered as PNG images
- HTML passthrough

## Image Inlining

Images are automatically converted to base64 data URIs, so pasted content
contains the actual image data. This works for:

- Remote images (HTTP/HTTPS URLs)
- Local images (relative paths)

The image data is embedded directly in the HTML, ensuring the image displays
correctly when pasted into any rich text editor.

## Math Support

LaTeX math expressions are converted to PNG images using embedded MathJax:

- **Inline math**: `$E = mc^2$` → renders as inline image
- **Display math**: `$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx$$` → renders as centered block image
- **Math code blocks**: ` ```math ` blocks also render as display math images

The PNG approach ensures math renders correctly in all rich text editors. MathJax
