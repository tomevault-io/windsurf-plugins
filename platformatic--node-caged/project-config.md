# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains experiments for building Node.js with V8 pointer compression enabled. Pointer compression is a V8 optimization that reduces memory usage by using 32-bit compressed pointers instead of full 64-bit pointers.

## Build Commands

Build a Docker image variant (bookworm, slim, or alpine):
```bash
docker build --network=host -f docker/bookworm/Dockerfile -t node-caged .
```

Note: `--network=host` is required to avoid DNS resolution issues during the build.

Run the container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it node-caged
```

Run a specific script:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app node-caged node /app/your-script.js
```

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

Test scripts in `tests/`:
- `verify-pointer-compression.js` - Verifies pointer compression is enabled by checking heap limits
- `memory-benchmark.js` - Benchmarks memory usage with pointer-heavy data structures

## Architecture

Dockerfiles in `docker/` build Node.js from the v25.x branch with the `--experimental-enable-pointer-compression` configure flag. Three variants are available:
- `docker/bookworm/Dockerfile` - Full Debian bookworm (default)
- `docker/slim/Dockerfile` - Minimal Debian
- `docker/alpine/Dockerfile` - Alpine Linux

Key build details:
- Compiler: GCC 12 (required for C++20 support in V8)
- Node.js branch: v25.x (configurable via `NODE_VERSION` build arg)
- Build flag: `--experimental-enable-pointer-compression`
