# This Nimbus docs site

> `CLAUDE.md` delegates here. Keep project instructions canonical in this file.

Astro-based docs. The `nimbus-docs` package handles content schemas, sidebar/TOC, MDX→markdown, build hooks, and the `nimbus` CLI. Everything in `src/` is yours to edit.

## File layout

```
astro.config.ts              # imports nimbus + defineNimbusConfig
nimbus.json                  # records the last reviewed Nimbus package version
src/
├── components.ts            # MDX globals registry — every component used in .mdx must be listed
├── components/              # AgentDirective, Header, Render + ui/<slug>/
├── content/
│   ├── docs/*.mdx
│   └── partials/*.mdx       # referenced via <Render file="..." />
├── content.config.ts        # registers docsCollection() + partialsCollection()
├── layouts/                 # BaseLayout (NimbusHead), DocsLayout (sidebar/TOC/breadcrumbs)
├── lib/cn.ts                # Tailwind className merger
├── pages/

│   ├── og/
│   │   ├── _og-card-config.ts   # shared OG theme tokens (underscore = not a route)
│   │   └── [...slug].ts         # per-page OG cards

└── styles/                  # globals.css, prose.css
```

Cloudflare deploys also have `wrangler.jsonc` at the project root.

## Writing docs

Frontmatter validates against `docsSchema` (`nimbus-docs/schemas`). Required: `title`.

```mdx
---
title: My page
description: One-line summary.
---

Content here. The page H1 comes from `title` — don't repeat it in the body.

## Section heading
```

Rules:

- **Components must be PascalCase and registered in `src/components.ts`.** A pre-build validator catches typos with a "did you mean" hint.
- **Partials use `<Render file="..." />`.** Don't import `.mdx` directly. Shared content lives in `src/content/partials/<slug>.mdx`.
- **Icons use `astro-icon` + Phosphor.** `<Icon name="ph:<glyph>" class="w-4 h-4" />` from `astro-icon/components`. Glyphs: [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com).
- **Don't remove `<AgentDirective />` from `BaseLayout.astro`.** It points agents at `/llms.txt`.

## Adding things

| Goal | Action |
|---|---|
| New doc page | Create `src/content/docs/<slug>.mdx`. Sidebar picks it up. |
| New partial | Create `src/content/partials/<slug>.mdx`. Use via `<Render file="<slug>" />`. |
| UI from registry | `pnpm exec nimbus-docs add <slug>`. Register in `src/components.ts` if used in MDX. |
| Feature recipe | `pnpm exec nimbus-docs add <feature-slug>`. Pipe the printed brief to your agent. |
| Check it builds | `pnpm exec nimbus-docs check` — build-free preflight (env + structure + authoring + types). `--json` for an agent loop, `--fix` to repair what's safe. |
| Custom page route | Add a file under `src/pages/`. |
| Custom OG style | Edit `src/pages/og/_og-card-config.ts`. |
| Check for updates | `pnpm exec nimbus-docs outdated` — starter files behind their tag + registry components behind. |
| Upgrade Nimbus | Update the package, then run `pnpm exec nimbus-docs migrate --dry-run --diff`. Review every change and required manual step before applying. |
| Upgrade a starter file | `pnpm exec nimbus-docs diff <file>` to review, `diff --apply <file>` to pull a clean upstream change. |
| Upgrade a registry component | `pnpm exec nimbus-docs add <slug> --overwrite`, then review with `git diff`. |

Extend Sätteri using `markdown.mdastPlugins` for Markdown AST transformations or `markdown.hastPlugins` for HTML AST transformations.
If the site replaces Sätteri with another processor, set `admonitions: false` and keep that processor's existing callout implementation.

List installable items: `pnpm exec nimbus-docs list`.

## Upgrading Nimbus

Keep `nimbus.json` committed. Its `lastReviewedNimbusVersion` is the baseline Nimbus uses to select the versioned reviews crossed by a package upgrade; state-detected migrations come from the current project files. It is not a package pin and should not be edited by hand.

1. Update `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs` with the project's package manager.
2. Preview the complete plan with `pnpm exec nimbus-docs migrate --dry-run --diff`. If no baseline exists yet, add `--from <previous-version>`.
3. Review every versioned entry and resolve each blocked/manual item.
4. Apply safe edits only with explicit consent: `pnpm exec nimbus-docs migrate --yes`. Review the resulting diff, then rerun the preview.
5. When no migration remains, run `pnpm exec nimbus-docs migrate --yes` again to record the completed review in `nimbus.json`.
6. Run the project's typecheck and production build, then run `pnpm exec nimbus-docs check` again for post-build coverage.

Except for task-printing mode (`--print`), `migrate` exits nonzero while work or review remains; that is a pending-upgrade signal, not necessarily a command failure. Never skip versions by changing `nimbus.json` directly.
