Never mindlessly delete functions, variables, classes etc. - first ask yoursefl "why I do I need to delete it? what will happen if its not there?"
First check if there are instantions of the class or calls to a function.
Even when you see that there is not a single instantiation of the class or call to a function - ask user with the proposal to delete it, explain your analysis and tell why you think its safe to delete it.
Even if user agreed - add a tag "deleted def func_x" on the commit.
