# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Slint Node Editor** library (`slint-node-editor`), a generic Slint component library for building visual graph editors. It includes examples demonstrating how to use the library.

## Build Commands

All examples can be run from the root directory using the `-p` (package) flag:

```bash
# Build and run the full-featured example
cargo run -p advanced

# Build and run the minimal example
cargo run -p minimal

# Build and run the custom shapes example
cargo run -p custom-shapes

# Build and run the animated links example
cargo run -p animated-links

# Build and run the pin compatibility example
cargo run -p pin-compatibility

# Build and run the edge fade demo
cargo run -p edge-fade

# Build and run the zoom stress test (LOD system demo)
cargo run -p zoom-stress-test

# Check compilation of the library and all examples
cargo check --workspace
```

## Architecture

**Three-layer rendering** (back to front):
1. **Background** - Grid and link paths (SVG-based)
2. **Children** - Node components (Slint components)
3. **Overlay** - Selection box, link preview, input handling

**Coordinate systems**:
- **World coordinates**: Graph-space positions (`world_x`, `world_y` on nodes)
- **Screen coordinates**: After pan/zoom transformation
- Conversion: `screen_x = world_x * zoom + pan_x`

**Pin ID encoding**: Application-specific. The generic library treats pin IDs as opaque integers. Examples:
- minimal: `pin_id = node_id * 2 + pin_type` (0=input, 1=output)
- advanced: `pin_id = node_id * 1000 + pin_type`

**Callback-based computation**: The Slint UI delegates expensive operations to Rust via callbacks (e.g., `compute-pin-at`).

**Level of Detail (LOD)**: NodeEditor supports configurable LOD thresholds for zoom-dependent rendering:
- `lod-full-threshold: 0.5` - Zoom above which nodes render full detail
- `lod-simplified-threshold: 0.25` - Zoom above which nodes render simplified detail
- Below simplified threshold: nodes render as minimal colored boxes
- See `examples/zoom-stress-test` for implementation patterns

## Data Models (in examples/advanced/src/main.rs)

The application maintains separate models for different node types but unifies operations via helper functions:

```rust
VecModel<NodeData>       // Simple nodes
VecModel<FilterNodeData> // Complex nodes
VecModel<LinkData>       // Logical connections
```

**Selection State**: the editor holds none — it emits intents (`node-selected`,
`select-link`, `selection-cleared`, `box-selection-committed`) and renders the
`selected` field of the rows.
- **Source of Truth**: the model rows themselves. `selected` is per-row data, so
  a host needs no separate store: read the current set with
  `selection::selected_rows`, resolve the gesture with `selection::resolve_click`
  / `resolve_box`, write it back with `selection::project_selection`.
  `selection::apply_click` / `apply_box` / `clear_selection` compose those three
  and are what `wire_selection!` calls. A host that keeps selection elsewhere
  (in its own document or session state) projects into the rows after every
  write; a missed projection is a stale highlight.
- **Resolution contract**: every intent resolves to an absolute set, never a
  delta, and both resolvers are order-stable. Selection order is
  presentation-stable and semantically meaningless — nothing may interpret it.
- **Timing**: selection intents that can affect a drag must be projected into
  the row flags synchronously, before the callback returns. `wire_selection!`
  does this. A host that defers selection updates must also own its drag policy
  and commit; selection changes during an active drag are otherwise unspecified.
- **Drag**: `end-node-drag` carries the dragged node id, and the commit moves
  that node plus whatever the rows show as selected (`GraphLogic::commit_drag`).
  Reading `selected` off the row is deliberate: it is the same data the editor
  renders, so a drag's visuals and its commit cannot disagree.

## Library Helpers

The library provides Rust helpers to reduce boilerplate:

**GeometryTracker** - Convenience wrapper for geometry cache setup:
```rust
let tracker = GeometryTracker::new();
window.on_node_rect_changed(tracker.node_rect_callback());
window.on_pin_position_changed(tracker.pin_position_callback());
let cache = tracker.cache(); // Use for hit testing, etc.
```

**Trait-based design** mirrors node handling:
- Nodes: `NodeGeometry` trait + `GeometryCache<N>`
