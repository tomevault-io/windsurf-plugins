# Agent Configuration

## Specification Management

When working on code changes or preparing a task specification:
- MUST read the relevant module specification from docs/system-specs/modules/ before making changes
- SHOULD read relevant shared pattern specifications from docs/system-specs/common/
- MUST update the appropriate system specification when making changes that impact APIs, schemas, integration contracts, or other documented behavior
- MUST include specification updates in the same CR as the code changes
- SHOULD only create new specification files when explicitly instructed
- MUST read only from docs/system-specs/ for current system context
- MUST ignore docs/task-specs/ directory (archived historical specifications) unless explicitly instructed to read from it

When creating task specifications:
- MUST store new task specifications in docs/task-specs/YYYY/MM/${task-id}-${feature-name}/
