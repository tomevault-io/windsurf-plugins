# Agent Guidance

This file provides guidance to coding agents when
working with code in this repository.

AI tools may assist with implementation, but do not
add Claude or another AI tool as a commit
collaborator, co-author, or signatory. Commit
sign-off belongs to the human contributor responsible
for the change.

## What This Is

The AI Grid: a distributed, peer-to-peer network
for AI inference routing and agentic networking
across clusters, cloud providers, and third-party
APIs. The Grid Operator orchestrates mesh formation,
trust, capability discovery, and routing - while
Praxis AI (from `../ai/`) handles all data-plane
traffic as the gateway.

## Architecture

The Grid Operator is an orchestration daemon, NOT a
proxy. It manages:

- SWIM membership via `foca` (peer discovery)
- mTLS certificate lifecycle (trust establishment)
- CRDT state propagation (capabilities, metrics)
- Praxis overlay config generation (routing decisions)

Praxis AI handles:

- Request proxying, API translation, credentials
- Filter pipeline execution
- TLS termination, health checks, connection pooling

See `docs/architecture/overview.md` for the full
design: CRDs, controllers, operational walkthrough,
scoring model, and auth framework. See
`docs/conventions.md` for coding style and policies.

## Requirements

- Rust stable 1.96+ (edition 2024, resolver 3)
- Rust nightly (for `rustfmt` - `group_imports` and
  `imports_granularity` are nightly-only)
- `cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny` (supply chain safety)
- `cargo-machete` (unused dependency detection)
- Docker or Podman (for mock servers and kind)
- kind (for integration testing)

## Quick Reference

Run from the `grid/` directory:

```console
make build          # workspace build
make check          # type-check only (fast)
make test           # all tests
make test V=1       # tests with --nocapture
make fmt            # format with nightly rustfmt
make lint           # clippy -D warnings + fmt check
                    #   + machete
make lint-extra     # typos + taplo + shellcheck
                    #   + actionlint
make doc            # rustdoc -D warnings, private
make audit          # cargo audit + cargo deny check
make all            # build + fmt + lint + test + audit
```

Single-test and single-crate commands:

```console
cargo test -p scoring            # one crate
cargo test -p mock-providers     # one crate
cargo test test_name             # one test by name
```

Test environment (requires Docker + kind):

```console
cargo xtask env up       # create clusters, certs
cargo xtask env down     # tear down everything
cargo xtask env status   # health of all components
```

## Workspace Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `operator` | K8s controllers, CRDs, operator binary |
| `overlay-sync` | K8s API-watch sidecar for overlay delivery |
| `swim` | foca wrapper, SWIM runtime, encryption |
| `crdt` | Delta CRDT types (LWW, OR-Set, G-Counter) |
| `scoring` | Scoring engine, backend types, grid state |
| `certs` | Certificate generation and provider trait |
| `mock-providers` | Mock OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex APIs |
| `forge` | Generic development-environment orchestrator for Kubernetes |
| `xtask` | Dev task runner for test environments |

### scoring

The scoring crate retains six normalized signal
fields for overlay contract and score-breakdown
compatibility. The supported `GridNetwork` API does
not combine them with arbitrary user weights. It
selects one provider-level strategy:

| Strategy | Active signal | Meaning |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `noMetrics` | none | Generic default for external APIs |
| `queueDepth` | `queue_depth` | Shortest normalized queue |
| `kvCachePressure` | `kv_cache` | Most available KV-cache |

Configure via `spec.scoringPolicy.strategy`. When
`scoringPolicy` is present, `strategy` is required;
omitting the entire policy selects `noMetrics`.

### certs

`CertificateProvider` trait with
`StaticFileProvider` (current) and planned
`SpiffeProvider` (production). `generate_ca()` and
`generate_site_cert()` produce mTLS certs with DNS
SANs and dual EKU.

### mock-providers

Four provider modules each exposing `router()`:

- `openai` - Bearer token auth, SSE streaming
- `anthropic` - `x-api-key` auth, Anthropic SSE
- `bedrock` - SigV4 prefix auth, binary event stream
- `vertex` - OAuth2 bearer auth, wildcard route

## Conventions

Full conventions in `docs/conventions.md`.

### Lint Discipline

Extremely strict workspace lints in `Cargo.toml`.
Notable denials: `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`,
`panic`, `indexing_slicing`, `unsafe_code`,
`missing_docs`, `missing_docs_in_private_items`,
`allow_attributes`.

Use `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]` for
suppressions, never `#[allow(...)]`. The
`allow_attributes = "deny"` workspace lint enforces
this.

### Error Handling

Use `?` propagation, match, or `unwrap_or_else`. In
tests, use `unwrap_or_else(|_| std::process::abort())`
or return `Result`.

### Test Organization

- Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks
- Order: imports, tests, test utilities
  (with `// Test Utilities` separator)
- No comments in test bodies - use assertion messages
- Async tests: `#[tokio::test]`
