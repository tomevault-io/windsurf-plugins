# Claude Repurpose: Content Repurposing Engine

## Project Overview

Standalone Claude Code skill that transforms any content (YouTube videos, blog posts,
podcasts, local files) into 10+ platform-optimized outputs. Follows the Agent Skills
open standard and the 3-layer architecture (directive, orchestration, execution).
20 sub-skills, 6 parallel subagents, 8 reference files, and 3 Python scripts.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/repurpose <url-or-file>` | Full repurposing to all platforms |
| `/repurpose <url> --platforms twitter,linkedin` | Specific platforms only |
| `/repurpose <url> --voice casual\|professional\|witty` | Override brand voice |
| `/repurpose <url> --brief` | Quick mode: top 3 platforms |
| `/repurpose <url> --images` | Generate images via /banana |
| `/repurpose analyze <url>` | Content atomization only (no outputs) |
| `/repurpose calendar` | Generate 7-day publishing calendar |

## Development Rules

- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines
- Reference files under 200 lines
- Scripts: CLI interface, JSON output, SSRF protection
- Kebab-case naming for all directories
- Agents invoked via Agent tool, never via Bash
- Python deps install into `~/.claude/skills/repurpose/.venv/`

## Security Rules

- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- URL validation in all scripts (block private IPs, loopback)
- No user credentials in output files
- Use `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` for paths

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Metadata loaded, instructions on activation, references on demand
2. **Content Detection**: Auto-detect YouTube, blog URL, local file, audio, pasted text
3. **Parallel Execution**: 5 subagents run simultaneously for maximum speed
4. **Platform-Native**: Never cross-post verbatim; adapt message, tone, format per platform
5. **/banana Integration**: Image generation is ENFORCED by default when /banana is available — quote cards, carousel covers, hero images generate automatically (no flag needed). Prompts always saved as fallback.
6. **Mandatory Outputs**: Every run MUST produce `all-content.md` (single consolidated file) and `index.html` (dark-themed viewer with Copy buttons). Run `scripts/generate_html.py` as final step.
