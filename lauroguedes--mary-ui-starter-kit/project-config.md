## General code instructions

- Don't generate code comments above the methods or code blocks if they are obvious. Generate comments only for something that needs extra explanation for the reasons why that code was written

---

## PHP instructions

- In PHP, use `match` operator over `switch` whenever possible
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion. Don't create an empty Constructor method if it doesn't have any parameters.
- Using Services in Controllers: if Service class is used only in ONE method of Controller, inject it directly into that method with type-hinting. If Service class is used in MULTIPLE methods of Controller, initialize it in Constructor.
- Use return types in functions whenever possible, adding the full path to classname to the top in `use` section

---

## Laravel instructions

- For DB pivot tables, use correct alphabetical order, like "project_role" instead of "role_project"
- I am using Laravel Herd locally, so always assume that the main URL of the project is `http://[folder_name].test`
- **Eloquent Observers** should be registered in Eloquent Models with PHP Attributes, and not in AppServiceProvider. Example: `#[ObservedBy([UserObserver::class])]` with `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\ObservedBy;` on top
- When generating Controllers, put validation in Form Request classes
- Aim for "slim" Controllers and put larger logic pieces in Service classes
- Use Laravel helpers instead of `use` section classes whenever possible. Examples: use `auth()->id()` instead of `Auth::id()` and adding `Auth` in the `use` section. Another example: use `redirect()->route()` instead of `Redirect::route()`.

---

## Use Laravel 11+ skeleton structure

- **Service Providers**: there are no other service providers except AppServiceProvider. Don't create new service providers unless absolutely necessary. Use Laravel 11+ new features, instead. Or, if you really need to create a new service provider, register it in `bootstrap/providers.php` and not `config/app.php` like it used to be before Laravel 11.
- **Event Listeners**: since Laravel 11, Listeners auto-listen for the events if they are type-hinted correctly.
- **Console Scheduler**: scheduled commands should be in `routes/console.php` and not `app/Console/Kernel.php` which doesn't exist since Laravel 11.
- **Middleware**: whenever possible, use Middleware by class name in the routes. But if you do need to register Middleware alias, it should be registered in `bootstrap/app.php` and not `app/Http/Kernel.php` which doesn't exist since Laravel 11.
- **Tailwind**: in new Blade pages, use Tailwind and not Bootstrap, unless instructed otherwise in the prompt. Tailwind is already pre-configured since Laravel 11, with Vite.
- **Faker**: in Factories, use `fake()` helper instead of `$this->faker`.
- **Policies**: Laravel automatically auto-discovers Policies, no need to register them in the Service Providers.

## Testing instructions

Use Pest and not PHPUnit. Run tests with `php artisan test`.

Every test method should be structured with Arrange-Act-Assert.

In the Arrange phase, use Laravel factories but add meaningful column values and variable names if they help to understand failed tests better.
Bad example: `$user1 = User::factory()->create();`
Better example: `$adminUser = User::factory()->create(['email' => 'admin@admin.com'])`;

In the Assert phase, perform these assertions when applicable:
- HTTP status code returned from Act: `assertStatus()`
- If HTTP status code is 200, use `assertSuccessful()` or `assertOk()`
- If HTTP status code is 302, use `assertRedirected()` or `assertRedirect()`
- If HTTP status code is 404, use `assertNotFound()`
- If HTTP status code is 422, use `assertInvalid()`
- If HTTP status code is 500, use `assertFailed()`
- If HTTP status code is 503, use `assertUnavailable()`
- If HTTP status code is 504, use `assertTimeout()`
- If HTTP status code is 401, use `assertUnauthorized()`
- If HTTP status code is 403, use `assertForbidden()`
- Structure/data returned from Act (Blade or JSON): functions like `assertViewHas()`, `assertSee()`, `assertDontSee()` or `assertJsonContains()`
- Or, redirect assertions like `assertRedirect()` and `assertSessionHas()` in case of Flash session values passed
- DB changes if any create/update/delete operation was performed: functions like `assertDatabaseHas()`, `assertDatabaseMissing()`, `expect($variable)->toBe()` and similar.

## Mary UI Livewire Components - Guide

### Overview

Mary UI is a collection of gorgeous Laravel Blade UI components designed for Livewire 4, styled with daisyUI v5 and Tailwind CSS v4. It provides pre-built, responsive components that integrate seamlessly with Livewire, allowing you to build dynamic interfaces without writing JavaScript.

### Component prefix tag

The Mary UI components for this project use the prefix `x-mary-`:

<code-snippet name="Component using prefix" lang="blade">
    <x-mary-select
        label="City"
        wire:model="city_id"
        icon="o-flag"
        :options="$cities"
    />
</code-snippet>
