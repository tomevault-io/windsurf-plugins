# Primitiv

Primitiv is a TypeScript MCP server that acts as a reconciliation layer for design systems. It sits above any number of design sources (Figma, codebase, Storybook, token files), resolves conflicts between them, and exposes a single canonical contract via MCP.

## Architecture

```
src/
  types.ts          — all shared types and interfaces
  index.ts          — build() and serve() entry points
  cli.ts            — CLI wrapper
  scanner/
    scanner.ts      — reads codebase, extracts tokens and components
    index.ts        — barrel export
  contract/
    contract.ts     — merges sources, surfaces conflicts, writes contract JSON
    index.ts        — barrel export
  mcp/
    server.ts       — MCP server with get_design_context, get_token, get_component, get_conflicts tools
    index.ts        — barrel export
  sources/
    codebase/       — codebase adapter (CSS variables, TS tokens, React components)
    figma/          — Figma API adapter (not yet implemented)
    storybook/      — Storybook adapter (not yet implemented)
  reconciler/       — conflict resolution logic (not yet implemented)
```

## Key concepts

- **Contract** — `primitiv.contract.json`, the resolved single source of truth written after a build
- **Source** — any adapter that provides tokens or components (codebase, Figma, Storybook, etc.)
- **Conflict** — a token or component that exists in multiple sources with different values
- **Governance** — configurable rules that determine which source wins when a conflict occurs

## Conventions

- All types defined in `src/types.ts`, never inline
- Sources are adapters — each implements `scan(): Promise<{ tokens: TokenMap, components: ComponentMap }>`
- New sources go in `src/sources/<name>/` with the same interface
- MCP tools are read-only (readOnlyHint: true) and return both text content and structuredContent
- Error messages tell the agent what to do next, not just what went wrong

## Stack

- TypeScript, strict mode
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for MCP server
- `zod` for input schema validation
- `glob` for file scanning
- No framework — plain Node.js

## Config

Users configure Primitiv via `primitiv.config.js` in their project root. The config shape is `PrimitivConfig` from `src/types.ts`.
