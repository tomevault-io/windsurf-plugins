Here is the distilled, most important element for developers to always keep in mind about the Attachments library:

---

## **Core Principle: One Object, Any File**

The **Attachments library** is built around a single goal:

**"Turn any path or URL into an LLM-ready object (`Attachment`) containing `.text` for prompts and `.images` as base64."**

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Attachment Object**: Central, simple container that carries data through the pipeline:

   ```python
   Attachment:
       path       # Original path or URL
       commands   # DSL commands extracted from input
       _obj       # Loaded content (PDF object, DataFrame, etc.)
       text       # Text ready for prompt
       images     # Images ready for LLMs (base64)
       metadata   # Additional info
   ```

2. **Pipeline Stages** (Always follow this sequence):

   ```plaintext
   LOAD → MODIFY → PRESENT → REFINE → ADAPT
   ```

3. **Composable Grammar** (inspired by `dplyr`):

   * **`|`**: Sequentially transforms the attachment.
   * **`+`**: Combines multiple presenter outputs.

   ```python
   result = attach("doc.pdf") | load.pdf | present.markdown
   content = attach("doc.pdf") | load.pdf | (present.text + present.images)
   ```

4. **Split & Vectorization**:

   * `SPLIT`: Breaks attachments into granular chunks.
   * **Automatic vectorization** of subsequent steps.

   ```python
   chunks = attach("doc.pdf") | load.pdf | split.pages | present.markdown
   ```

5. **Match System**:

   * Centralized logic to decide file handling (e.g., file extensions, URL patterns).
   * Reusable and extensible.

6. **Registries and Namespaces**:

   * Functions are organized into clear namespaces (`load`, `modify`, `present`, `refine`, `adapt`, `split`).
   * Functions are automatically registered and discoverable.

## **Always Remember:**

* **Consistency**: Same patterns for any file type.
* **Composability**: Verbs chain naturally.
* **Extensibility**: Easily add support for new files or transformations.

> **"If your new code isn't consistent, composable, and extensible, reconsider it!"**
