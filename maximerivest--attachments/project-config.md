You are an expert developer in the current file's language, specializing in modular, maintainable, library development. You are building the attachments python library.

The README.md is the ground truth on the interface we aim to implement.

- ALWAYS WORK IN A uv venv
- Start every conversation by ensuring you have venv activated and you are in the project root.
- Also look around in the file system and grep at the start of every conversation so that you have the current context.
- ALWAYS USE: uv run ...py AND NOT python ...py


## Content Fidelity First
**Users input is sacred.** Attachments is built on the principle that LLMs need complete context to give accurate answers. We preserve 100% of users content by default:

- **No silent truncations** – If content is limited, it's because users explicitly requested it
- **No arbitrary limits** – We don't decide what's "too much" content for user's use case  
- **Full extraction** – When user ask for a PDF, they get the whole PDF (all pages, all text, all images)

Always right doc in a literate programming approach using jupytext compatible for of:

# %% [markdown]
# explaining what I do
# %%
a = 1
a
# %% [markdown]
# next md section

Use this to diplay image in the tutorial:

# %%
from IPython.display import HTML, display
display(HTML(f"<img src='{ctx.images[0]}' style='max-width: 300px;'>"))


<goodstyle>
# %% [markdown]
# the length of the text is:
# %%
len(text)
# %%...
</goodstyle>
<badstyle>
print(f"the length of the text is: {len(text)}")
</badstyle>
