# AGENTS.md — synty

Working rules for changing code in this repo. Read `docs/design.md` for the
architecture and target end-state, and `evals/` for the kernel validation
before making changes. This file does not restate them.

Parsing of coding-agent session logs and GitHub ingestion are ported from the
v1 implementation in `../synty-legacy` (Go tailers under
`internal/source/<tool>/`, TypeScript GitHub backfill under
`server/src/lib/github/`). The new implementation is a single self-contained
Rust binary.

## Commit messages

- Never mention Claude, Claude Code, Anthropic, or any AI assistant anywhere in
  a commit message, and never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming an
  assistant. Commits are authored by the human committer, full stop.
- Subject is imperative and scoped (e.g. `M1: Louvain topics ...`). The body
  explains the why and the measured effect, preferring numbers (docs/s, cluster
  counts, repo and PR numbers, dates) over adjectives.

## Build / test / run

- `cargo test` runs the scenario suite. It is pure: no model, corpus, or
  network needed — including the fleet/bucket integration scenarios (multi-writer
  convergence, delta read-model pull, lease, bucket contract), which use temp
  local-dir buckets. The model-heavy end-to-end fleet check lives in
  `scripts/fleet-smoke.sh` (run on demand; needs a prior local build).
- `cargo build --release` is the shipped build: plain CPU, portable,
  dependency-light. Keep it that way.
- On Apple Silicon, develop with `cargo build --release --features metal` (GPU
  encode, ~5.7x faster). `accelerate` (macOS CPU BLAS) and `mkl` (Linux) are
  the other opt-in backends. None may become default.
- Distribution is GitHub Releases, cut by `.github/workflows/release.yml` on a
  `v*` tag: it builds per platform with explicit features (this does not change
  the default above) — `--features metal,s3,gcs,mcp-http,athena` for the macOS asset,
  `--features s3,gcs,mcp-http,athena` for Linux — and attaches `synty-<os>-<arch>`
  (+ `.sha256`).
  `synty upgrade` self-updates from the latest release (sha256-verified, via the
  GitHub token); a cached nag flags when behind. These are ops, not pipeline
  steps. The same tag builds Linux amd64 and arm64 on native hosted runners,
  then publishes a verified multi-architecture manifest to the dedicated
  private ECR `851725219920.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/synty`; the Helm
  chart follows `Chart.appVersion`.
- The encoder loads the model from `$SYNTY_MODEL` (point it at a local dir for
  offline use; it otherwise downloads the default model on first run).
- The watcher polls local logs every 30 seconds and publishes only new complete
  lines as immutable event chunks every 60 seconds by default. `init
  --capture-since` persists an absolute collection boundary;
  `--upload-interval` changes only the network cadence. S3 workstations use an
  explicit rotating `--aws-profile` (normally `credential_process`); AWS
  workloads omit it and use their role chain.
- Pipeline: `ingest` → `index` (encode docs + build) → `summarize` (one-line
  summary per unit) → `cluster [--resolution]` (group units by their summary
  embedding) → `summarize` again (reduce each topic from its members) /
  `search` / `related` / `eval` — or `build`, which runs the whole chain in
  order. `cluster`
  consumes unit summaries; the topic pass of `summarize` consumes the clusters.
  Builds are immutable dirs under `index/builds/<build>/` behind the
  `index/current.json` pointer; clusters are additive revs inside the build.

## Metrics

Operations that produce health or quality numbers emit them the same way, never
ad hoc: build a `metrics::Run`, record named fields, `emit()` a `[metrics <op>]`
block to stderr. `cluster` logs modularity, misplaced %, grab-bag and collapsed-duplicate
counts, cluster-size min/median/max, and the session/doc mix; `summarize` logs
unit coverage, topics named, duplicate names, fallback names, name
faithfulness, and throughput; a `stats` block reports session token-usage
capture coverage; `ingest` also emits a `coverage` block (fleet machines,
actor↔GitHub join, install rate). Redirect stderr (`2>> runs.log`) if you
want a history.
When a change is meant to move quality, read the metric — don't eyeball it or
recompute in a throwaway script.

## Code

- Match the surrounding style: comment density, naming, idiom. Each module opens
  with a short comment on what it owns and why.
- Every behavioral change gets a scenario-style unit test written from user
  expectations, not from the implementation (see the existing `#[cfg(test)]`
  blocks).
- A change to a command, flag, default, path, model, or metric also greps
  `README.md` / `docs/design.md` / `AGENTS.md` for the old behavior and reconciles —
  docs drift one stale sentence at a time. Prefer claim-free phrasing for
  anything that moves (test counts, corpus sizes) over numbers that rot.
- The core derivations — retrieval, clustering, keyphrases — stay LLM-free:
  embeddings, deterministic logic, and extractive text only. The exceptions are
  session summaries and topic names, generated by a small local model
  (Qwen3-0.6B, the `llm` feature). "Nothing leaves the machine" is the actual feature and holds either
