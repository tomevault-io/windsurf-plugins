# Agent guide for this repo

This repo holds reusable [Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills) for DevOps / platform work.
Read this before creating, editing, or evaluating a skill.

## Layout

```text
skills/<skill-name>/          # SOURCE — committed
  SKILL.md                    #   the skill itself: description, working style, checklist, validate, done-when
  references/*.md             #   detail read only when a branch needs it (rules + why, procedures)
  scripts/*                   #   deterministic helpers the skill runs (linted, --help, structured output)
  evals/evals.json            #   eval DEFINITIONS (prompts + assertions) — committed, this is the test contract
  evals/fixtures/             #   input files some evals hand to the agent
.evals/<skill-name>/          # RUN ARTIFACTS — gitignored, never committed
  iteration-N/                #   one dir per eval run: transcripts, grading.json, timing.json, benchmark.*
```

## Where skill evals go — important

There are two different things, and they live in two different places:

- **Eval definitions** — the prompts and assertions that _define_ each test.
  These live next to the skill at `skills/<skill-name>/evals/evals.json` and **are committed**.
  They are the contract for the skill: a reviewer reads them to know what behavior must hold,
  and they let anyone re-run the evals later to catch regressions.

- **Eval run artifacts** — the _output_ of executing those evals (transcripts, gradings,
  timings, `benchmark.json`/`benchmark.md`, viewer logs).
  These go in **`.evals/<skill-name>/iteration-N/`** at the repo root, which is **gitignored**.
  They are regenerated on every run and are machine-specific, so they are not source of truth.

When running the skill-creator eval loop, point the workspace at `.evals/<skill-name>/`
instead of the tool's default `<skill-name>-workspace/` sibling. Every skill-creator script
(`generate_review.py`, `aggregate_benchmark`) takes the workspace path as an explicit argument,
so this is just a matter of passing the right path — e.g.:

```bash
python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark .evals/<skill-name>/iteration-N --skill-name <skill-name>
```

`make eval-benchmark SKILL=<skill-name>` and `make eval-view SKILL=<skill-name>` wrap those two
scripts with the right paths (see the Makefile; `ITER` defaults to the highest iteration present).

If you want to publish a quality scorecard, copy a single curated `benchmark.md` into the
skill folder and commit just that — do not commit the rest of `.evals/`.

## Before committing

Run `make lint` (and `make fmt` first if prettier complains). It runs `markdownlint`, `prettier --check`, and `yamllint` (configs in `.github/linters/`, the same files super-linter reads in CI), `shellcheck` on every
`skills/*/scripts/*.sh`, `py_compile` on `skills/*/scripts/*.py`, and `actionlint` + `zizmor` + `poutine` + `pinact -check` on this repo's workflows (actionlint also on the well-formed eval fixtures).
Tools are never installed by the Makefile; a missing one prints its `brew install` formula.

## Writing skills

When advice on skill structure conflicts, prefer Matt Pocock's `writing-for-agents` rules, then
Anthropic's skill-creator and docs, then other sources. The rules below are the ones we have settled on.

- **Pushy description, third person.** The description does two jobs: say what the skill does, then
  list the situations that should activate it, one "when" per branch on specific topics (create a
  workflow, edit a job, harden, speed up, publish an image, findings from a named scanner), and end
  the list with "even if they don't say 'X'" so the model triggers on the task, not the keyword. Add a
  non-trigger only when another skill genuinely competes for the same prompts; otherwise it is a sentence
  the model reads on every turn for nothing. Write it in third person; the body carries identity, the
  description carries the trigger.
- **Positive rules with a why.** Say what to do, not what to avoid: `pull_request` for PR triggers, rather
  than "never use pull_request_target". No caps-lock MUST/NEVER; a prohibition drags the banned behaviour
  into context, and a shouted rule reads as louder, not clearer. Every rule ends with the reason it exists,
  so the model can tell when the rule applies and when the situation is different.
- **Inline what every branch needs; disclose the rest.** SKILL.md stays under about 100 lines of body;
  once a section is read by only some tasks, move it to `references/<topic>.md` with a "read when" clause
  at the sentence where that branch is decided (the specs allow up to 500 lines; we split far earlier
  because every inline line is paid for on every call). Co-locate a gotcha with its rule instead of a
  separate Gotchas section, and end steps in a checkable done-when list.
- **Link the skill's own files; backtick everything else.** Pointers to files the skill ships are markdown
  links with the filename as the text: `read [audit.md](references/audit.md) and follow it`,
  `→ [security.md](references/security.md)`. Backticks are for paths in the user's repo
