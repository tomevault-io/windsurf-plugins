# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is `@makeplane/plane-node-sdk` — a TypeScript SDK for the Plane API. It uses axios for HTTP, targets Node.js >=20, and is managed with pnpm@10.20.0.

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install dependencies
pnpm build                # Compile TS + bundle type definitions
pnpm dev                  # Watch mode for development
pnpm test                 # Run all tests (Jest)
pnpm test:unit            # Unit tests only
pnpm test:e2e             # E2E tests only
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/unit/project  # Run a single test file
pnpm test:coverage        # Run with coverage report
pnpm check:lint           # Lint check (oxlint)
pnpm fix:lint             # Auto-fix lint issues
pnpm check:format         # Format check (oxfmt, 120 char width)
pnpm fix:format           # Auto-format
```

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/unit/` and `tests/e2e/`. Tests require a `.env.test` file (copy from `env.example`) with real workspace/project IDs. Tests run sequentially (`maxWorkers: 1`) to avoid API rate limits. Jest uses `tsconfig.jest.json` via ts-jest.

## Architecture

**Entry point**: `src/index.ts` re-exports everything. The main consumer-facing class is `PlaneClient` (`src/client/plane-client.ts`), which instantiates all API resources with shared `Configuration`.

**BaseResource pattern** (`src/api/BaseResource.ts`): Abstract base class providing HTTP methods (get, post, patch, put, httpDelete) via axios. All API resource classes extend it. Handles both `apiKey` (X-Api-Key header) and `accessToken` (Bearer token) auth. Includes optional request/response logging with sensitive data sanitization.

**API resources** (`src/api/`): Each resource class extends BaseResource. Some have sub-resources as separate classes composed by the parent:

- `WorkItems/` → Comments, Attachments, Activities, Relations, WorkLogs
- `Customers/` → Properties, Requests
- `Teamspaces/` → Members, Projects
- `Initiatives/` → Labels, Projects, Epics
- `AgentRuns/` → Activities
- `WorkItemProperties/` → Options, Values

**Models** (`src/models/`): TypeScript interfaces for each entity with separate Create/Update DTOs. Uses `Pick`, `Omit`, and `Partial` for DTO derivation. Notable: `WorkItem` uses a generic expandable fields pattern (`WorkItem<E extends WorkItemExpandableFieldName = never>`).

**Errors** (`src/errors/`): `PlaneError` (base) → `HttpError` (HTTP-specific with status code and response data).

**OAuth**: Standalone `OAuthClient` (`src/client/oauth-client.ts`) handles authorization flows, token exchange, and refresh separately from the main SDK auth.

## Conventions

- All API endpoint URLs must end with `/`
- Standard resource methods: `list`, `create`, `retrieve`, `update`, `del`
- Never use "Issue" in names — always use "Work Item"
- File naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods
- Avoid `any` types; use proper typing or `unknown` with type guards
- Build produces `dist/` with compiled JS, declarations, source maps, and a bundled `types.bundle.d.ts`
