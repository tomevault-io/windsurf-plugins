description: Helios profile-level automation defaults for deploy orchestration

# Helios Profile Automation

- Prefer installed Cursor Marketplace MCP/plugin servers before raw API calls.
- Use profile defaults from `~/.cursor/helios-profile/profile.defaults.json` when project config omits values.
- Never write plaintext secrets in repo files, rule files, or docs; use env vars only.
- For `Deploy Helios`, run dry-run first, then apply.
- Require deployment report and verification JSON output for every run.
