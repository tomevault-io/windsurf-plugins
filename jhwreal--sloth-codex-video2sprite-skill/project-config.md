# AGENTS.md

## Scope

This directory is the source of truth for the `sloth-codex-video2sprite-skill` Codex Skill.

- Source: `/Users/john/Documents/slothsunolyric/sloth-codex-video2sprite-skill`
- Git remote: `git@github.com:jhwreal/sloth-codex-video2sprite-skill.git`
- Codex install: `~/.codex/skills/sloth-codex-video2sprite-skill`
- Keep the directory name, `SKILL.md` name, install directory, and `$sloth-codex-video2sprite-skill` invocation identical.
- Commit or push only when the user explicitly requests it.

## Purpose and boundaries

Provide the unified entry point for 2D sprite production. Default new continuous actions to the existing video pipeline; route standalone artwork to imagegen and image-sheet generation/processing to the separately maintained `my-codex-sprite-skill` backend only when needed. Preserve each backend's formats, source provenance, timing, required sound and acceptance rules.

The video backend remains independently usable. Image-sheet routing may read the installed `my-codex-sprite-skill` on demand; do not duplicate its scripts or point either backend at the other's run format. The image path may use built-in imagegen and necessary image inspection. Do not infer gameplay hitboxes, projectile behavior, or human approval from pixels alone.

## Cost and motion policy

Optimize total cost per accepted gameplay action. Reuse approved sources, start
videos at 768 with a large complete subject, use short sufficient durations and
concise action-specific briefs. Require a reason and explicit approval before
2K. Validate a representative pilot before expansion; stop repeating a failure
without diagnosis. Ordinary candidates can be processed as production directly.

Preserve the requested pose contrast, timing, scale, root and ending. Translate
internal engine/pivot settings into visible movement for provider prompts. The
exporter adds only the selected motion/ending and shared constraints; do not add
unrelated action catalogues. Clean visuals, no BGM and required dry SFX remain.
Keep legacy processing caches valid; offline prompt tests do not prove visual
improvement. Production specifics belong in the references, not duplicated here.

## Media firewall and scoped image inputs

- Never print or return Base64, data URLs, media bytes, signed URL query strings, full provider payloads, credentials, or unbounded logs.
- Decode provider media inside the worker and write it directly to disk.
- Limit CLI stdout to compact JSON summaries. Redact all debug and error output through the same safe serializer.
- Keep generated runs, raw media, caches, review decisions, and private references outside the Skill source.
- Native image-tool inputs/outputs and necessary image inspection are allowed only for the selected image path; never dump raw media payloads into text or logs.
- Video processing/review keeps media in the localhost reviewer; agents use the bounded `status` or
  `compare` command and read only small `qc.json`, `manifest.json`, and
  `approval.json` files.

Changes to worker serialization or logging require regression coverage proving stdout and persisted logs stay bounded and contain no Base64 or data URL. Routing image work through native image tools does not relax that worker contract.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9 or newer.
- Pillow and NumPy.
- FFmpeg and FFprobe.
- Network access and provider credentials only for real API calls.

Do not install packages without user approval. Prefer the Codex bundled Python when the system runtime lacks Pillow or NumPy.

## Change workflow

Before changing behavior, read `SKILL.md`, the relevant reference, and every affected script. Keep CLI help, schemas, references, tests, and Skill instructions synchronized.

Validate at minimum:

1. `skill-creator` `quick_validate.py`.
2. Python bytecode compilation for all scripts and tests.
3. `--help`, `doctor`, and `models` CLI smoke checks.
4. Unit tests, including the media-firewall test.
5. A synthetic offline end-to-end video-to-sprite run with audio.
6. `git diff --check` and a scan for secrets, absolute runtime paths, Base64 fixtures, caches, and generated media.

Run paid or live-provider tests only after credentials are configured and the user has authorized the call. Install only after source validation passes, and exclude `.git`, tests, caches, environments, and runtime outputs from the installed copy.

## Provider and model rules

- Image settings resolve as CLI override, environment, then bundled preset. Video model selection belongs to the external generator.
- Keep model IDs configurable; presets are not proof that a model is enabled on the user's account.
- Preserve provider task IDs and input hashes so interrupted work resumes without accidental duplicate billing.
- `advance` processes local candidates only. Do not restore direct video-provider submission or polling; preserve historical media and metadata.
- A valid processing-cache hit must not rewrite artifacts or invalidate approval.
- Apply pilot review and retry budgets in the agent workflow before external generation; the local CLI has no billed-task guard.
- Draft processing is for selection only; packaging requires production processing followed by a current approval.
