# Agent maintenance index

**pr-agent** is a GitHub PR agent: automated reviews on `pull_request` events plus `/review`, `/describe`, `/ask`, and `/triage` slash commands. It runs as two roles over Postgres + pg-boss: **web** (webhook intake, durable dedupe, job enqueue) and **worker** (ack, review, ask, description, triage, retention queues).

## Always apply

- Use the domain vocabulary from [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md); it is the canonical product language — do not invent synonyms.
- No magic numbers or env defaults in feature modules; everything goes through `src/settings/`. Follow the knob-change checklist in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
- Long prompt prose lives in prompt modules, not settings; see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).
- Import concrete modules, not removed barrel `index.ts` files; run `nubx knip` after refactors (details in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md)).
- If a change alters runtime topology, update the [README.md](README.md) "How It Works" Mermaid diagram in the same PR (rubric in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md)).
- Docs are part of the change: if your change is critical (see Keep the docs true), update the matching doc in the same PR.

## Keep the docs true

If none apply, no doc update is needed; do not update docs speculatively.
