## 1. Purpose
**PJSK Sticker** (Project Sekai Sticker Maker) is a cross-platform application built with Flutter, designed for fans of the game *Project Sekai: Colorful Stage! feat. Hatsune Miku*. It enables users to create personalized stickers by overlaying custom, styled text on character-specific game assets. The app features a high-fidelity rendering engine that mimics the game's iconic sticker style, including multi-shadow text outlines and specific Japanese fonts.

## 2. Tech Stack
- **Primary Language**: Dart (Flutter SDK)
- **Framework**: Flutter 3.7.2 or higher
- **Design System**: Material 3 with Dynamic Color support
- **Target Platforms**:
  - **Mobile**: Android (optimized for Android 16/HyperOS), iOS
  - **Desktop**: Windows, macOS, Linux (support for file saving and clipboard)
  - **Web**: Flutter Web (Canvas-based rendering with custom font loading)

## 4. Dependencies & Modules
| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `dynamic_color` | Implements Material 3 dynamic theming based on system wallpaper. |
| `flutter_colorpicker` | Provides UI for selecting custom text colors. |
| `path_provider` | Handles platform-specific file system paths. |
| `pasteboard` | Enables copying generated images to the system clipboard (Desktop). |
| `share_plus` | Facilitates sharing generated stickers to other applications. |
| `shared_preferences` | Persists user settings (character selection, layers, fonts). |
| `permission_handler` | Manages storage and photo permissions on Android/iOS. |
| `http` | Support for external API interactions (configuration sharing). |

## 5. Naming & Coding Conventions
- **Language Style**: Follows [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
- **Architecture**: **Layer-first**.
  - **Data/Logic**: Isolated in `PjskGenerator` and `ImageTextOverlay`.
  - **UI**: Managed via `StatefulWidget` using local `setState` for high-frequency updates (like position sliders).
- **State Persistence**: User progress is automatically serialized to JSON and stored via `SharedPreferences`.

## 6. Core Classes & Functions Index
### `PjskGenerator` (lib/sticker.dart)
- `TextLayer`: Data model for a single text layer. Now uses compressed JSON keys (`c`, `x`, `y`, etc.) for URL length optimization and includes backward compatibility for old formats.
- `pjsk()`: Orchestrates the sticker generation process. Utilizes static caches (`_imageCache`, `_fontCache`) with a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) eviction policy for images (30 items limit) to ensure smooth performance.
- `characterMap` / `characterStickers`: Metadata mapping.

### `ImageTextOverlay` (lib/image_text_overlay.dart)
- `generateStickerFromBytes()`: The engine for image compositing. Now includes a `_fontLoadFutures` map to manage concurrent font loading requests, ensuring each custom font is registered with the Flutter engine exactly once and avoiding race conditions during multi-layer rendering.
- `_createTextPainter()`: Handles complex text styling with multi-shadow outline effects.
- `_compositeImages()`: Performs canvas transformations for multi-layer rendering.

### `StickerPage` (lib/pages/sticker.dart)
- `_layers`: List of `TextLayer` managed in state.
- `_currentLayerId`: Currently selected layer ID (ensures stable selection during list mutations). Now protected by a robust getter that ensures at least one layer exists.
