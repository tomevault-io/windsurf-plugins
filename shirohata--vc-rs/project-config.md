## Build environment

First-time setup (winget + NVIDIA SDKs): see `scripts/README.md`. The line is
Windows, CUDA 13 / TensorRT 11. Day-to-day:
- Per shell session, dot-source `. scripts/activate.ps1` before building/testing
  (puts CUDA/cuDNN/TensorRT on PATH; without it test exes fail to launch with
  `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`). To run tests without the GPU stack, set
  `VC_RS_ENABLE_NATIVE_TENSORRT=0`.

## Real-time audio constraints
- Avoid heap allocation, blocking I/O, and locks on the real-time audio callback path.
- Do not perform logging directly inside the audio callback unless already proven safe.
- Prefer preallocated buffers and message passing to background workers.
- Any change to chunking, buffering, or latency-sensitive code should be reviewed for real-time safety.

## Shared conversion pipeline
- CLI, GUI, VST3, and WAV conversion must reuse the shared conversion pipeline
  wherever their device, host, and offline-processing constraints permit.
- Keep inference, chunk conversion, smoothing, and output assembly in shared
  components rather than duplicating them in front-ends.
- Do not add a front-end-specific conversion path without documenting why the
  shared components cannot satisfy its constraints.
- Keep unavoidable differences narrowly scoped to device or host I/O,
  scheduling, buffering, latency reporting, and offline final-tail handling.
- Follow [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) as the canonical
  description of conversion data flow and ownership boundaries.

## Distribution safety
- Do not embed or ship machine-specific paths, developer-machine user names,
  secrets, local models, caches, logs, debug artifacts, or other local state.
- Build distributable archives only through the repository packaging scripts;
  keep backend variants isolated and include all required third-party licenses.
- Before publishing a package, follow [`docs/distribution.md`](docs/distribution.md).

## Comments for future coding agents

When modifying non-trivial code, leave comments that help future AI agents
understand intent, constraints, and safe modification boundaries.

Prefer comments that explain:
- Why this implementation exists, especially when a simpler alternative looks tempting.
- Invariants that must remain true.
- Performance, latency, allocation, threading, or real-time constraints.
- Compatibility requirements, file format assumptions, or protocol expectations.
- Which nearby modules, tests, or configuration must be reviewed together when changing this code.
- Known trade-offs or intentionally rejected alternatives, when that context prevents accidental "cleanup".

Do not add comments that merely restate obvious code behavior.
Avoid filler comments such as "increment counter" or "loop over items".

When a future agent might incorrectly refactor or simplify a section,
add a concise guardrail comment explaining what must not be changed casually.
