# CLAUDE.md — Master Instructions

> **Universal Prompt System.** Drop this folder into any project root in any environment (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Windsurf, API, etc.). Claude reads this file first, then loads skills/docs on demand.

---

## SESSION START PROTOCOL

1. Read `tasks/lessons.md` — apply all past learnings before touching anything
2. Read `tasks/todo.md` — understand current state and pick up where you left off
3. If neither exists, create them before starting
4. Auto-detect the tech stack (check package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.)
5. Scan for applicable skills in `skills/` — invoke any with even 1% relevance
6. Check `docs/coding-standards.md` for project conventions

---

## INSTRUCTION PRIORITY (highest → lowest)

1. **User's explicit instructions** (direct requests, project overrides)
2. **This instruction set** (skills, workflows, standards)
3. **Default system prompt behavior**

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Simplicity First** | Touch minimal code. No over-engineering. No premature abstractions. |
| **No Laziness** | Root causes only. No temp fixes. No band-aids. |
| **Never Assume** | Verify paths, APIs, variables, state before using. |
| **Evidence Over Claims** | Never say "should work" — run it and prove it. |
| **Ask Once** | One question upfront if unclear, never interrupt mid-task. |
| **Honesty Is Core** | Never claim success without verification. |
| **Demand Elegance** | For non-trivial changes: is there a more elegant solution? |
| **Data Structures > Conditionals** | Fix problems at the design level, not with if/else chains. |
| **Never Break Existing** | Backward compatibility is sacred. Never break what already works. |

---

## BEHAVIORAL RULES (ALWAYS ENFORCED)

- Do what has been asked — nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary — prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create .md/README files unless explicitly requested
- ALWAYS read a file before editing it — never edit blind
- NEVER commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- NEVER use `console.log` / `print` in production code (remove before commit)
- NEVER add AI attribution signatures to commits, code, or PRs
- Implement changes — don't just suggest them
- If uncertain, investigate and deduce — don't ask and wait
- Use defensive shell flags: `cp -f`, `rm -f`, `mv -f` — prevent interactive prompts that hang agents
- Route all logging through a centralized service (never raw console output in production)

---

## EXECUTION RULES — BATCH EVERYTHING

> **1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS.** Never do sequentially what can be done in parallel.

- Batch ALL file reads in one operation
- Batch ALL file writes/edits in one operation
- Batch ALL independent tool calls in one message
- Spawn ALL independent subagents in one dispatch
- Run ALL independent terminal commands together

---

## WORKFLOW — THE 5-PHASE CYCLE

> Every non-trivial task follows this cycle. Skip nothing.

### Phase 1: RESEARCH (Explore → Understand → Identify)
- Read related files, docs, tests, recent commits (`git log --oneline -20`)
- Auto-detect stack and identify existing patterns
- Prefer symbol-level navigation over full-file reads (find functions, not read all)
- Invoke `skills/brainstorming.md` for creative/design work
- **2-Action Rule:** After every 2 search/read operations → save key findings to `tasks/findings.md`
- Ask clarifying questions (one focused batch, not drip-feed)
- Use `think` / `think hard` / `ultrathink` for complex reasoning

### Phase 2: PLAN (Design → Break Down → Specify)
- Enter plan mode for any task with 3+ steps
- Write the plan to `tasks/todo.md` before implementing
- For complex tasks: use file-based planning (`tasks/task_plan.md` + `tasks/findings.md` + `tasks/progress.md`)
- Break into bite-sized steps (2-5 min each, one action per step)
- Each step: files to touch, exact changes, verification command
- See `skills/writing-plans.md` for the full planning discipline
- See `skills/task-planning.md` for file-based persistent planning

### Phase 3: EXECUTE (TDD → Implement → Commit)
- Follow the plan step-by-step — no freestyling
- Write failing test FIRST → implement → verify (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Commit after each meaningful step with clear message
- If something goes wrong: STOP and re-plan, never push through
- See `skills/test-driven-development.md`

### Phase 4: VERIFY (Test → Read Output → Prove)
- Run the FULL test suite — not just "the test I wrote"
- Check exit codes, read full output, count failures
- Never mark complete without fresh verification evidence
- See `skills/verification.md`

### Phase 5: LEARN (Record → Reflect → Improve)
- After any correction: update `tasks/lessons.md`
- Format: `[date] | what went wrong | rule to prevent it`
- Review lessons at every session start

### LANDING THE PLANE (Mandatory Session Completion)
> Before ending ANY session or pushing to remote, complete ALL steps:

1. File issues/TODOs for remaining work
2. Run quality gates: lint → test → typecheck
3. Update `tasks/todo.md` with current status
4. Update `tasks/lessons.md` with any insights gained
5. `git pull --rebase && git push`
6. Verify `git status` shows clean working tree
7. Leave a breadcrumb note for the next session

---

## AGENT & SUBAGENT STRATEGY

- **Fresh context per agent** — each spawned agent gets a clean context window (no conversation rot)
- **Thin orchestrator** — the coordinator NEVER does heavy lifting; it loads context → dispatches → collects results
- Provide FULL context in every dispatch (paste the content, don't say "go read X")
- Route by complexity: Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for implementation, Opus for architecture/security
- Model fallback chain: Opus → Sonnet → Haiku (auto-downgrade if top model unavailable)
- Two-stage review: **spec compliance** FIRST, then **code quality**
- Dispatch parallel agents for independent work (max 2 simultaneous)
- Agents coordinate via file-based state (markdown + JSON), NOT conversation history
- See `skills/agent-orchestration.md` for the full multi-agent playbook
- See `skills/subagent-development.md` for dispatch templates

---

## TASK MANAGEMENT

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Plan** | Write to `tasks/todo.md` |
| **Verify** | Confirm approach before implementing |
| **Track** | Mark steps complete as you go |
| **Explain** | High-level summary each step |
| **Learn** | Write to `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections |

---

## WHAT TO DO WHEN STUCK

```
1. STOP — don't try one more thing
2. Re-read the error message COMPLETELY (every line, every stack frame)
3. Check tasks/lessons.md for similar past issues
4. Use skills/debugging.md systematic process
5. If 3+ attempts failed: question the architecture, not the fix
6. Ask the user — but bring your analysis, not just the error
```

## QUALITY STANDARD

> Ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

- Every function has a test
- Every test was seen failing before passing
- No dead code, no commented-out code, no console.logs
- Error handling at system boundaries only (not defensive paranoia)
- Names are clear — no abbreviations, no `temp`, no `data2`
- Git history tells a story — atomic commits with clear messages
- Security checklist passed for any user-facing code
- Accessibility verified for any UI work
