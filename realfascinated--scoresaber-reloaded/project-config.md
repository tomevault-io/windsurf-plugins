# AGENTS.md

This file is the working agreement for humans + AI agents contributing to this repo.

## Repo layout

- **Root**: Bun workspaces, shared formatting via `.prettierrc.json`.
- **`projects/backend/`**: Bun runtime backend (TypeScript, ESM, decorators enabled). PostgreSQL via **Drizzle ORM**; schema and migrations live under `src/db/` and `drizzle/` (see **Database** below).
- **`projects/common/`**: Shared TS package `@ssr/common` (builds to `dist/`).
- **`projects/website/`**: Next.js app (React 19, Next 16, Tailwind).

## The golden rules

- **Match existing patterns**: Prefer extending the local conventions in the file you’re touching over introducing new abstractions.
- **Keep changes scoped**: One change-set should solve one problem; avoid drive-by refactors.
- **Don’t fight tooling**: Prettier is the source of truth for formatting; ESLint/Next lint for correctness.
- **No secrets in git**: Never commit `.env*`, tokens, credentials, or private URLs.

## Formatting (Prettier)

- **Run formatting**: `bun run prettier` (from repo root).
- **Configured behaviors** (see `.prettierrc.json`):
  - Semicolons, 2-space indentation, `printWidth: 110`
  - Import organization via `prettier-plugin-organize-imports`
  - Tailwind class sorting via `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`

## TypeScript style guide (all projects)

- **Strict TS**: Don’t weaken types to “get it to compile”. Prefer narrowing, proper return types, and typed helpers.
- **No `any` or `unknown`**: Do not use `any`. Do not use `unknown` in place of a real type—use concrete types (interfaces, unions, generics, branded types, or schema-inferred types) everywhere values need to be described.
- **Error handling**:
  - Throw `Error` (or project-specific error types) with actionable messages.
  - Don’t swallow exceptions silently.
- **Naming**:
  - `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for types/classes/components.
  - File names: follow the surrounding folder convention (this repo commonly uses kebab-case in TS/TSX filenames).
- **Braces for control flow**: Use a block for `if` / loop bodies (and similar). Do not put the body on the same line as the condition without braces.

```ts
if (bla) bad(); // do not do

if (bla) {
  good(); // do this
}
```

## Imports

- **Prefer ESM imports**: This repo is largely `moduleResolution: "bundler"` and ESM-friendly.
- **Keep imports tidy**: Let Prettier organize; don’t hand-sort unless necessary.
- **Website path alias**: In `projects/website`, `@/*` maps to `projects/website/src/*`.

## Backend (`projects/backend/`) guidelines

- **Lint**: `bun run lint` (from `projects/backend`).
- **Runtime assumptions**: Code runs on Bun; prefer Web-standard APIs when available.
- **HTTP / services**:
  - Keep business logic in services; keep request handlers thin.
  - Prefer explicit input validation at boundaries (especially for request params/body).
- **Async**:
  - Avoid sequential awaits inside loops when concurrency is safe; prefer batching with `Promise.all`.
  - Always consider timeouts/retries for external calls.

## Database (Drizzle + PostgreSQL)

The backend uses **Drizzle ORM** against **PostgreSQL**. The schema is TypeScript; SQL migrations are versioned in git.

| What                     | Where                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Drizzle config           | `projects/backend/drizzle.config.ts` (`schema`, `out`, `dialect: postgresql`)        |
| Schema (source of truth) | `projects/backend/src/db/schema.ts` (and related `src/db/` code)                     |
| Generated SQL + journal  | `projects/backend/drizzle/*.sql`, `projects/backend/drizzle/meta/`                   |
| Apply migrations in code | `projects/backend/src/db/run-migrations.ts` (used at startup / deploy as applicable) |

**If you change the schema** (`schema.ts` or table definitions), **including indexes**:

- **Tables / columns / indexes** are all defined in `schema.ts` (e.g. `pgTable` plus `index()` / `uniqueIndex()`, partial indexes with `.where()`, or `using("gin", …)` for trigram/GiST—follow existing patterns in that file). Treat new or changed indexes like any other DDL: they belong in generated SQL under `drizzle/`, not as one-off changes on a live DB only.

1. **Generate a migration** (from `projects/backend`):
   - `bunx drizzle-kit generate`
   - Produces new numbered `.sql` files under `drizzle/` and updates `drizzle/meta/` (including `_journal.json`). **Commit these files together with your schema change** so everyone and CI share the same DDL history.

2. **Apply migrations** to a database (after `DATABASE_URL` is set, e.g. via `.env`):
   - From `projects/backend`: `bun run db:migrate`
   - This runs `scripts/db-migrate.ts`, which calls the same migrator as the app but prints full errors. **Prefer this over `bunx drizzle-kit migrate` here** — the Drizzle migrate TUI can hide failure details (see comment in `db-migrate.ts`).
