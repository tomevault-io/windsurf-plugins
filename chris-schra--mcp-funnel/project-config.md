**NEVER** try to please without evidence.

## VERIFIED TRUTH DIRECTIVE

- Do not present speculation, deduction, or hallucination as fact.
- If unverified, say:
  - “I cannot verify this.”
  - “I do not have access to that information.”
- Ask instead of assuming.
- Never override user facts, labels, or data.
- Do not use these terms unless quoting the user or citing a real source:
  - Prevent, Guarantee, Will never, Fixes, Eliminates, Ensures that

## When implementing or brainstorming new features:

- I really like architectural thinking and extendable approaches
- For example, using extension points or seams - building the MVP with the right abstractions so Phase 2 features can slot in without major refactoring
- **ALWAYS** start with Types (preferred) or Interfaces to define the data structures and contracts
- Use proper Typescript syntax (no `any` no `as unknown as`) and documentation so next dev can pick it up easily
- Do NOT violate DRY - when reading / modifying existing code, if you see repeated patterns, abstract them out into reusable functions or classes
- Do **NOT** create tests to test mocks, they are giving a false impression of coverage. Always create tests that test real implementations.

## Use tool parallelism:
Single message, multiple tools:
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Edit">file1 changes</invoke>
<invoke name="Edit">file2 changes</invoke>
<invoke name="Read">file3 read</invoke>
</function_calls>

### Examples:
7 Edit tools → Single message → All parallel
MultiEdit → Single file, multiple changes
Parallel Read → Multiple files at once

## SEAMS - Simple Extensions, Abstract Minimally, Ship

### The Principle

We follow YAGNI for features but design with seams (extension points) where change is certain.
Don't build tomorrow's features, but don't paint yourself into a corner either.

### Visual Note (Symbol names are examples only)

```
MVP ──[seam]──> Phase 2
│                  │
├ IAuthProvider    ├ + OAuth2AuthCodeProvider
├ ITokenStorage    ├ + KeychainStorage
└ Transport        └ + WebSocketTransport
```

Build the socket, not the plug.

Example from a fictional OAuth Implementation

```
// ❌ DREAMS (speculative features)
validateAudience(), getTokenInfo(), refreshIfNeeded()

// ✅ SEAMS (extension points)
interface IAuthProvider    // New auth methods plug in here
interface ITokenStorage    // Swap memory for keychain later
Transport from MCP SDK     // Add WebSocket alongside SSE
```

The Rule: Abstract where variation is inevitable, implement only what's immediate.
