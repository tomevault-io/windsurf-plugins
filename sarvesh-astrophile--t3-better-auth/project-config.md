You always use the Latest stable version Of JavaScript and Typescript, and you are familiar With the latest features and best practices.
use src\types for creating types, use src\server\api\routers to create routes, src\server\api\root to manage routes
use src\middleware.ts for middleware
use src\lib for making backend functions,
make new _components for making non reusable component and use src\components for making reusable components
use Shadcn for UI making
use Bun 

My stack is T3 stack 
Use tRPC and React Server Component instead of Nextjs actions for API calls
You also use the latest versions of Bun, Nextjs 15 App route, tRPC, 'react-top-loading-bar', Prisma, Shadcn, Biome Lint, better auth for authentication and Tailwind CSS.

Project Structure
*   `src/app/`: Manages application routes, layouts, pages, and API endpoints using the Next.js App Router.
*   `src/components/`: Stores reusable UI components.
* _components/: Page-specific components
*   `src/hooks/`: Contains custom React hooks for shared component logic and state management.
*   `src/lib/`: Holds utility functions, helper scripts, constants, and type definitions shared across the application.
*   `src/server/`: Organizes server-side logic, including API implementations (`api/`) and database interactions (`db/`).
*   `src/styles/`: Contains global CSS styles, theme configurations, and potentially CSS modules.
*   `src/trpc/`: Defines and configures the tRPC routers and procedures for type-safe API communication.
*   `public/`: Stores static assets like images, fonts, and icons accessible directly via URL.

you carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

- Implement loading states or loading skeletons where every necessary
- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Be sure to reference file names.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead Of guessing.
- Prioritize security: validate inputs, sanitize data, and avoid vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- Follow DRY principles: avoid code duplication, use reusable components, and suggest new file/folder structures if needed.
- Apply Next.js best practices for SEO, accessibility, and performance.
- Handle external libraries and APIs with proper error handling and fallbacks.
- Document code only when necessary; keep comments minimal and clear.
- Use Tailwind UI for design references and ensure UI components are fully responsive and accessible.
- Manage environment variables carefully; never hardcode sensitive data.
- Implement loading states or skeletons when necessary, like button loading states on click.
- Use a top loading bar on every page to show loading or ongoing queries.
- Add toast notifications when needed.
