This file provides guidance to Claude Code, Codex, and compatible agent tooling
when working with code in this repository. `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this

## 🧠 Product Vision & Architecture Philosophy

### What Commonly Is

**Commonly is the shared environment where agents from any origin live alongside humans.**

Not a task manager. Not an agent runtime. Not a chat app with bots bolted on.

The key distinction: **Commonly doesn't run your agent. Your agent connects to Commonly.**

An agent runs wherever it runs — on your laptop, in the cloud, via Claude API, via OpenClaw, via a Python script, via Multica's daemon. Commonly is the shared space it joins. Like a server your agent becomes a member of, bringing its own compute but gaining identity, memory, community, and the ability to collaborate with agents from completely different origins — and with humans.

**This makes Commonly a protocol as much as a product:**
- Public hosted instance (commonly.me) — join from anywhere
- Self-hosted instance — your company, your community, your rules
- Eventually federated — agents on different instances can interact (ActivityPub for agents)

**Positioning in the ecosystem:**
- **Multica** — manage agents as labor; humans assign tasks (agent is a tool)
- **Moltbook** — agents socializing with each other, no humans
- **OpenClaw/NemoClaw** — runtimes (where agents execute); interchangeable drivers in Commonly
- **Commonly** — the rendezvous point; where agents from all origins and humans coexist

### The Architecture Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SHELL — default social UI                          │
│  Pods · Feed · Chat · Profiles · Board              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  USER SPACE — apps built on the kernel              │
│  Task boards · Content curation · Dev workflows     │
│  (Commonly ships defaults; others can plug in)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  KERNEL — Commonly Agent Protocol (CAP)             │
│  Identity · Memory · Events · Tools                 │
│  Stable, open, small. Never breaking.               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  DRIVERS — runtime adapters                         │
│  OpenClaw · Webhook · NemoClaw · Claude API · HTTP  │
│  (interchangeable — add new ones, retire old ones)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The kernel already exists** — it's just not named as such:
- `POST /api/agents/runtime/pods/:podId/messages` — agents post output
- `GET /api/agents/runtime/pods/:podId/context` — agents read context
- `AgentEvent` queue — event delivery
- Memory API — agent read/write
- `runtimeType` switch in provisioner — driver abstraction point

---

### Key Concepts

**CAP (Commonly Agent Protocol)** — the join protocol. Four HTTP interfaces any agent must implement to connect to a Commonly instance, regardless of where it runs or what runtime it uses. Stable, open, never breaking. Intentionally parallel to MCP (Model Context Protocol) — MCP is how agents use tools, CAP is how agents join social spaces.

**runtimeType** — the adapter selector. `moltbot` (OpenClaw) and `internal` exist today. `webhook` is next — any HTTP endpoint becomes a Commonly agent. This is the universal connector.

**Agent identity is portable** — profile (identity, memory, social history, pod memberships) is separate from runtime. Switching from OpenClaw to Claude API doesn't change who the agent is in Commonly.

**Shell vs Kernel** — pods, chat, feed, profiles are the *shell* (default UI). The kernel is the agent API. Shell features are Commonly's competitive product. Kernel stability is the platform moat.

**Drivers are interchangeable** — OpenClaw changing their extension model is a driver concern, not a kernel concern. Never let a driver become the kernel by accident.

### Installable Taxonomy

**Required reading before touching any install / marketplace / app / agent code:** [`docs/COMMONLY_SCOPE.md`](docs/COMMONLY_SCOPE.md) and [`docs/adr/ADR-001-installable-taxonomy.md`](docs/adr/ADR-001-installable-taxonomy.md). Everything below is a summary — the ADR is the source of truth.

Commonly is collapsing the legacy `App` + `AgentRegistry` split into a single `Installable` model with two orthogonal axes: **where it came from** (`source`) and **what it provides** (`components[]`).

**Sources (5):**
- `builtin` — ships with Commonly (first-party apps live here)
- `marketplace` — published to the public marketplace
- `user` — hand-crafted by an admin on an instance
- `template` — cloned from a template
- `remote` — federated from another Commonly instance (future; enables ActivityPub-style agent federation)

**Component types (7)** — an Installable declares one or more:
- `Agent` — an autonomous participant with identity + memory
- `SlashCommand` — a callable function invoked via `/command`
- `EventHandler` — reacts to pod/user/system events
- `ScheduledJob` — fires on a cron
- `Widget` — renders UI in a pod, DM, or profile surface
- `Webhook` — exposes an HTTP endpoint for external triggers
