## Development Workflow

Use a small verification harness before changing behavior.

- Run `./scripts/check.sh` before claiming the project is healthy.
- Keep `bin/claude-guard` dependency-light: bash, curl, jq.
- Do not commit real tokens, OAuth credentials, local Claude settings, or live diagnostic logs.
- Keep network-heavy checks out of the default test suite.
