# CLAUDE.md

## Core Principles

1. **Occam's Razor** — Prefer simple solutions; don't add abstractions until needed.
2. **Code Quality** — Modular, single source of truth, explicit over clever, types as documentation.
3. **Documentation** — CLAUDE.md is the entry point (keep concise). Commands over prose. Update docs with code.
4. **Project Structure** — `justfile` as command runner, `scripts/` for complex logic, `project.yaml` for metadata.
5. **PR Hygiene** — Never leak internal LAN, host, app, deployment, screenshot, log, URL, or environment details into any outbound surface: PR titles/bodies, inline review comments, issue bodies, commit messages destined for public history, and any text submitted via `gh` to GitHub. Scrub private IPs, internal infrastructure hostnames (including the project's specific runner/staging machine names — refer to them generically as "the self-hosted runner" or "the staging VM"), internal app/team names, usernames, and machine-specific paths before sending. This rule also applies to `CLAUDE.md` itself and every file in the repo: never enumerate the actual sensitive identifiers here as "examples"; refer to them by category only.

These apply to every artifact in this repo — code, docs, and CLAUDE.md itself.

## Project Overview

Heron is an LLM API performance monitoring system that analyzes network traffic to measure and diagnose LLM inference performance. Deployed on the **LLM provider's server side** (post-TLS termination, plaintext HTTP), it serves ops, dev, and business teams.

**Data acquisition:**
- Local NIC capture via libpcap
- Remote packet ingestion via ZMQ from [cloud-probe](https://github.com/Netis/cloud-probe)

**Supported LLM providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Gemini, local deployments (vLLM/Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)

**Key metrics:** TTFT, E2E Latency, TPOT, Call Rate, Token Throughput, Active Calls, Call Error Rate, Cache Hit Ratio

## Tech Stack

### Backend — Rust

- **Async runtime:** Tokio
- **Web framework:** Axum
- **Packet capture:** pcap crate (libpcap)
- **ZMQ:** zeromq ([zmq.rs](https://github.com/zeromq/zmq.rs), pure Rust)
- **HTTP parsing:** httparse (zero-copy)
- **Serialization:** serde + serde_json
- **Storage:** duckdb-rs (DuckDB), sqlx (PostgreSQL), clickhouse-rs (ClickHouse) — pluggable backend via trait
- **Config:** config crate (TOML)
- **Logging:** tracing + tracing-subscriber
- **CLI:** clap

### Frontend — React SPA

- React + TypeScript
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Bun + Vite
- React Router
- TanStack Query (server state: API caching, polling, retry)
- Zustand (client state: UI state, filters, preferences)

**Styling rule:** Always use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Never write raw CSS except in `index.css` for Tailwind directives and CSS variable definitions.

Pipeline: capture → flow dispatcher (hash by flow key) → N parallel workers (protocol + llm) → turn tracker + metrics (aggregation) + storage (DB write). Flow sharding ensures same-connection packets stay in one worker. See architecture.md for details.

See [docs/design/01-architecture.md](docs/design/01-architecture.md) for detailed design decisions.
See [docs/design/04-turn.md](docs/design/04-turn.md) for Turn (agent interaction) tracking design.

## Storage

Three entities: `agent_turns` (agent turn), `llm_calls` (per-call detail + full body), `llm_metrics` (pre-aggregated time-series). Relation: `agent_turns 1─N llm_calls`. Pluggable backends:

**Query rule — no JOIN.** Read-path SQL MUST NOT use any `JOIN`. Cross-entity reads are split into multiple point lookups: e.g. fetch `call_ids` from `agent_turns` by PK, then `SELECT ... FROM llm_calls WHERE id IN (?, ?, ...)`. See `query_turn_calls` in `h-storage-duckdb/src/turns.rs` for the canonical pattern. This keeps queries uniformly cheap across DuckDB/PG/ClickHouse and avoids planner surprises at scale.
