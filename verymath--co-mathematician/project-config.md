# Coding-Agent Co-Mathematician Rules

This repository is a coding-agent-driven AI Co-Mathematician workspace.

When Cursor is operating in this repository:

- The active Cursor Agent chat/session is the Project Coordinator.
- The repository filesystem is the shared artifact store.
- `agents/roles/` is the canonical role layer.
- `.cursor/rules/co-mathematician-roles.mdc` is the Cursor adapter for those roles.
- Separate Agent chats, fresh reviewer prompts, or available agent delegation features are workstream coordinators, specialized agents, and reviewers.
- The harness only provides schemas, state files, gates, report skeletons, and validation scripts.
- Do not build a new multi-agent platform here.
- Do not start a mathematical research project during workspace initialization.

Default workspace-mode flow:

```text
onboarding -> research question formalization -> goal approval -> workstreams -> reviewer loop -> final working paper
```

If the user explicitly invokes a project-local domain Skill, or accepts a Skill
suggested by `co-math suggest-skills`, enter skill-guided mode instead. Record
the handoff with `co-math skill-handoff` and follow that Skill's own opening,
modeling, and approval flow for the inner task. Promote the task into goals and
workstreams only when the user wants durable research output, reviewer-gated
claims, or a final working paper.

Hard rules:

- Default workspace mode runs onboarding before goal approval.
- During workspace-mode onboarding, ask the user to choose a workspace document language policy.
- Refresh the project-local skill registry at session start, after skill installation, and before formalizing goals.
- Before creating any workstream, match the workstream scope against the project-local skill registry and read any relevant `SKILL.md`.
- Always get explicit user approval of goals before starting any workstream.
- Never start a workstream for an unapproved goal.
- Important claims must include provenance.
- Failed explorations must be saved as durable artifacts.
- Uncertainty must be exposed explicitly in reports and status updates.
- Every workstream report must be reviewed by an independent reviewer pass or agent.
- A workstream whose review has not passed must not be marked complete.
- Final output must be a working paper, not a chat summary.

Cursor operating notes:

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `agents/roles/`, `.agents/skills/co-mathematician/SKILL.md`, and `.cursor/rules/co-mathematician-roles.mdc` before running a research project.
- Use Agent mode to edit durable files under `workspace/`.
- Install or copy project-specific Skills into `.agents/skills/` by default, not global skill roots, unless the user explicitly asks for a personal cross-project install.
- Use `co-math` only for initialization, skill registry and handoff records, message append, workstream creation, gate checks, and final rendering.
- If native subagents are unavailable, create independent reviewer passes with fresh prompts and save reviewer outputs in `workspace/workstreams/<id>/reviews/`.
- Never self-approve a workstream report.
- Record the user's language policy in `workspace/project/PROJECT.md`,
  `workspace/project/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and the `language_policy` block of
  `workspace/project/GOALS.yaml`; keep schema keys, gate names, statuses, and
  harness commands in English.
