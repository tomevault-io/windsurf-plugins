NEVER create a separate jest.config file, always put these in package.json.
NEVER `cd` to another directory, always stay in the project root.
NEVER use CommonJS, use ES6 JS for everything as much as possible.
NEVER use npm, only yarn.
NEVER swallow errors, or use a "fallback" codepath in case of errors, or do anything else that might fail silently.
ALWAYS fail quickly safely and visibly.
