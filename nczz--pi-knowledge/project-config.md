# Development Rules

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` unless absolutely necessary
- ESM only (`"type": "module"`)
- Biome for formatting (tab indent, 120 line width) and linting
- No inline imports by default. Dynamic imports are allowed only for optional/heavy runtime paths that should not load at extension startup (for example model, parser, PDF/DOCX, or filesystem helpers inside rarely used tools).
- Use erasable TypeScript syntax (Node strip-only compatible)
- Avoid non-null assertions. Prefer explicit checks with actionable errors.
- Keep root `index.ts` startup-light: importing it with Node strip-only must not require Pi virtual modules beyond type-only imports.

## Commands

- `npm run check` — biome lint + format (run after every code change)
- `npm test` — unit tests
- `npm run test:e2e` — integration tests (requires Pi + model API key)
- Never run tests unless asked or after creating/modifying test files
- Before release or commit readiness, also run:
  - `node --experimental-strip-types -e "import('./index.ts')"`
  - `npm pack --dry-run`
  - `pi -e ./index.ts` or a one-shot `pi -e ./index.ts -p ...` dogfood
- PDF/DOCX e2e fixtures must be supplied via `PI_KNOWLEDGE_E2E_PDF` and `PI_KNOWLEDGE_E2E_DOCX`. Do not commit private fixture files or extracted fixture content.
- Treat plain `npm run test:e2e` as a smoke gate only when PDF/DOCX fixture env vars are unset. Release-grade e2e must run with both fixture env vars and report whether tests were skipped.
- External fixtures may live outside the repo, such as `~/Downloads`, but never persist fixture paths, extracted text, or private document content in tests, snapshots, docs, or commits. Report only non-sensitive summaries such as pass/fail and chunk counts.

## Commit Convention

- Format: `feat|fix|docs|refactor|test: <description>`
- One logical change per commit
- Stage only files changed in this session
- Commit readiness requires a clean explanation of which gates were run, which were skipped, and why.

## Review Contract

- Findings must distinguish blocking bugs, non-blocking risks, and documentation-only issues.
- Each conclusion must identify its verification level: static read, unit test, e2e smoke, release-grade e2e with external fixtures, Pi dogfood, or external dependency not verified.
- Do not call skipped tests a full pass. If a gate succeeds with skipped cases, say exactly which coverage did not run.
- Comments and docs must describe verified behavior. Compatibility shims should document the minimum contract they implement, not unverified host internals.
- Async lifecycle review (mandatory for any code with timers, event handlers, or dispose/shutdown):
  1. List every independent caller of the async function.
  2. Determine whether callers can overlap (timer + shutdown event, repeated tool calls, failed retries, same tick, etc.).
  3. Identify the guard state that prevents re-entry, double-dispose, duplicate timers, or stale callback work.
  4. Verify guard state is updated before any `await` that could yield to another lifecycle caller.
  5. Verify dispose/cleanup is idempotent: concurrent or repeated calls must not double-free resources or close already-closed handles.
  6. Verify reload/recreate paths wait for in-flight cleanup before constructing replacement resources.
  7. Treat lifecycle-only format diffs as behavior-sensitive; they still require this analysis before approval.

## Documentation Alignment

- Behavior contract changes belong in `AGENTS.md`.
- Contributor workflow changes belong in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- User-visible capability or install/development changes belong in `README.md`.
- Repeated bugs, runtime traps, or review learnings belong in `docs/known-pitfalls.md`.
- Architecture or dependency decisions belong in `docs/technical-decisions.md` or the relevant spec under `docs/`.
- Release or publish process changes must be reflected in the release checklist before the release commit.

## Testing

- Unit tests in `test/unit/` — no external deps, no network, fast
- E2E tests in `test/e2e/` — requires Pi runtime, may need API keys
- Benchmarks in `test/bench/` — performance regression tests
- Test file naming: `<module>.test.ts`

## Dependencies

- Pin exact versions in package.json
- Current approved production deps are exactly the pinned entries in `package.json`. Do not add new production deps without approval.
- Pi virtual modules (`@earendil-works/pi-*`, `typebox`) are provided by Pi at runtime, but this package should not require them as runtime imports from `index.ts` unless they are also declared or guarded. Type-only imports are acceptable.
- Add deps only when the user approves

## Extension Development

- Entry point: `index.ts` (default export ExtensionFactory)
- Test with: `pi -e ./index.ts` (direct load, no install needed)
- Install locally: `pi install ./` (from project root)
- All tools must handle `signal?.aborted` for cancellation
- All tools must use `onUpdate` for progress reporting during long operations
- Source types are a behavior contract: directories/files/text/URLs must remain updateable or intentionally documented as one-shot. If adding a source type, cover add + update + status/diagnostics.
