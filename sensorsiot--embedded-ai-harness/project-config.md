# Project — Conventions

## Language and style

- Python 3.9+ on the Pi (the oldest supported target), 3.11 in the devcontainer.
  Do not use syntax newer than 3.9 in `pi/`.
- `snake_case` for functions and variables.
- Format and lint with `ruff`.

## API conventions

- All endpoints live under `/api/`.
- Every response is JSON carrying `"ok"`: `{"ok": true, ...}` or
  `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`.
- `GET` takes query parameters; `POST` and `DELETE` take a JSON body; file
  transfers are `multipart/form-data`.
- Slot-addressed operations take `{"slot": "SLOT1"}` — the label, not an index.
- A new endpoint is not finished until it appears in **FSD Appendix D** and, if it
  is client-callable, in `mcp/testbench_mcp.py`'s `SPECS` table. The two udev
  callbacks (`/api/hotplug`, `/api/wifi/lease_event`) are deliberately absent from
  MCP — they fire on the Pi, not from a client.

## Verification commands

```bash
ruff check .
mypy --strict .
pytest pytest/ --wt-url http://$BENCH:8080
```

**Current state, stated honestly:** `ruff check .` reports 36 findings and
`mypy --strict pi/` reports 864 across 16 files. Neither is clean, so neither
gates a commit today. The standing rule is therefore *do not make it worse*:
a change must not add findings in the files it touches. Treat clean lint and
types as a debt to pay down, not a gate to pretend exists.

There is no ruff or mypy configuration file; both run on defaults.

## Commits

- Conventional-commit style prefixes (`docs:`, `fix(...):`, `portal:`).
- Never commit `tmp/`, `__pycache__/`, build output, or secrets.
- The `.mcpb` bundle is generated — rebuild it (`npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb pack .`)
  rather than hand-editing, and commit the rebuilt artifact when
  `mcp/testbench_mcp.py` changes.

## Skills

Skills under `.claude/skills/` are part of the product, not scratch notes. They
belong to this plane: a skill constrains how the bench is driven, which is a HOW
question, and the same rules apply to it as to any Method document.

**A skill links to Appendix D; it never restates it.** Endpoint lists, request
and response shapes, field defaults and state tables are the FSD's to state. What
belongs in a skill is the judgment that cannot be derived from the contract —
which call to reach for, in what order, what breaks, and what the failure looks
like. That split is not tidiness: a restated table has nothing tying it to the
code, so it drifts silently, and a skill and the FSD each end up authoritative
where the other is wrong.

When an endpoint's contract changes, update the skills that name it in the same
change as the FSD — a skill quoting a dead endpoint is a defect. Scripts shipped
beside a skill are code and are wrong in the same way a skill is: check them
against the handler, not against the skill's prose.

`.claude/skills/` is the list — each skill's `description` states when it
applies, which is also how it gets selected. The FSD and User Manual describe what
each drives.
