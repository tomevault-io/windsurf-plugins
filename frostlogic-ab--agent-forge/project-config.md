# Docusaurus Documentation Best Practices for Agent Forge

## General Principles
- **Accuracy and Consistency:** Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.
- **Clarity:** Write clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice.
- **Completeness:** Provide enough detail for users to understand and use the features.

## Content Guidelines
- **Code Examples:**
    - All code examples provided in `.mdx` files must be runnable or clearly marked as conceptual.
    - Ensure example code blocks are **not commented out** unless they are explicitly intended to show a non-working/commented part of a larger example.
    - Include necessary import statements (e.g., `import { Agent, LLM } from "agent-forge";`).
    - Use placeholder API keys like `process.env.YOUR_API_KEY` or `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` and instruct users to replace them.
    - Clearly label examples as "Conceptual" if they require users to define auxiliary classes/variables (e.g., `MyTool`, `agentConfig`) not fully provided in the snippet.
- **API References:**
    - When referencing types or configurations from external libraries (e.g., `token.js`), clearly state this and point users to the relevant external documentation for exhaustive details.
- **Linking:**
    - Ensure all internal links within the documentation are valid and point to the correct sections or pages.

## Docusaurus Specifics
- **File Naming & Routing:**
    - To avoid "Duplicate Route" errors, be mindful of Docusaurus's routing behavior. A directory `foo/` with an `index.mdx` inside (`foo/index.mdx`) will create a route at `/foo`. A file `foo.mdx` at the same level will also try to create a route at `/foo`.
    - Prefer using `directory/index.mdx` for overview/landing pages of a section and `directory/specific-topic.mdx` for detailed pages within that section. For instance, `reference/llm/index.mdx` for the LLM overview and `reference/llm/llm-class.mdx` for the `LLM` class details.
- **Sidebar Configuration (`sidebars.ts`):**
    - All document IDs referenced in `sidebars.ts` must correspond to actual `.mdx` file paths (relative to the `docs` directory, without the `.mdx` extension, and using `/` as path separators).
    - For example, a file at `docs/docs/reference/llm/llm-class.mdx` should be referenced as `reference/llm/llm-class` in `sidebars.ts`.
    - After renaming or moving documentation files, always update `sidebars.ts` accordingly.

## Maintenance
- **Documentation with Code Changes:**
    - **Crucial:** Whenever changes are made to the source code (features added, APIs modified, behavior altered), the corresponding documentation **must be updated** to reflect these changes.
    - Treat documentation as an integral part of the development lifecycle, not an afterthought.
- **Review:**
    - Regularly review documentation for outdated information, broken links, or unclear explanations.
