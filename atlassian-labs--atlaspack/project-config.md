When any Rust code is modified we should always do some basic checks to ensure it meets our standards.

- run `cargo check` to ensure the code is buildable
- run `cargo fmt --all` to reformat the code
- run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and fix any issues that are reported
- run `cargo nextest r` to ensure unit tests still pass
- run `yarn build-native` to ensure that the Rust bindings for Atlaspack still build correctly
