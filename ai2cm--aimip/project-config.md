## Notebook Execution

When iterating on figures, run any cell that is solely involved in generating figures (function definitions, plot calls, helper utilities). **Never run the full notebook** — data processing takes ~20 minutes. Data is cached and already loaded in the kernel, so figure cells run immediately.

Typical pattern: edit the figure function cell → run it → run the call cell → inspect the output → repeat.

**Running cells:** Use the Jupyter REST API against the already-running server (`jupyter server list` to get the URL/token). Find the kernel ID for the target notebook via `GET /api/sessions`, then execute code via the kernel websocket. Do not ask the user to run cells — iterate autonomously and only ask the user to confirm the final output before committing.

**Editing notebook cells:** The evaluation notebooks are too large for the Read tool (exceeds token limit). Never attempt to use Read or NotebookEdit on these files. Instead, use a Bash Python snippet: `json.load` the notebook, find the cell by `id`, mutate `cell['source']`, and `json.dump` it back. Use Grep to search cell content directly in the `.ipynb` file.

**Prefer targeted cell edits over full rewrites.** When only a few lines change, replace just those lines (string `.replace()` on the joined source). Full cell rewrites risk introducing escaping bugs — in particular, writing cell source as a Python triple-quoted string in a heredoc causes `\"\"\"` to appear in docstrings instead of `"""`. If a full rewrite is truly necessary, write the new source to a temp `.py` file with the `Write` tool, then `open(tmpfile).read()` it into the notebook dict — this avoids any Python string escaping layer.

**Do not commit figure changes until the figure has been run and the output confirmed.** Layout issues only appear at render time — committing before review locks in problems that require an amend.

## Manuscript Figure Conventions

Rules established while building E1 manuscript figures. Apply to all notebooks (E2–E5).

### Labels and titles
- Use long names from xarray variable metadata (`da.attrs.get('long_name', varname)`), lowercased (`.lower()`), with underscores replaced by spaces.
- Exception: `zg` should be prefixed with "500 hPa" since the dataset metadata doesn't include the pressure level.
- For pressure-level panels in multi-panel figures, put the variable name on line 1, the pressure level (e.g. "850 hPa") on line 2, and units on the last line — always use consistent multi-line titles across all panels in a row to avoid vertical misalignment.
- Wrap long variable names with `textwrap.fill(long_name, width=18)` to prevent column-to-column title overprinting.
- Never put units in the y-axis ylabel if it risks overprinting adjacent panels — put units in the panel title instead (e.g. last line of a 2–3 line title).
- Use `labelpad=1` on ylabels to keep them tight to the tick labels.

### Scientific notation
- Never use matplotlib's default floating offset label (`1e-6` hovering above an axis) — it collides with titles and legends.
- Use `ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'{x:g}'))` for all axes.
- Do NOT use `ScalarFormatter` — it still produces a floating multiplier label.

### Unit conversions
- Convert precipitation (`pr`) from kg m⁻² s⁻¹ to mm day⁻¹ by multiplying by 86400. Display units as `mm day$^{-1}$`.
- Apply scale factors to the data before plotting, not after.

### Pressure-level selection
- When selecting a single pressure level with `.sel(plev=plev)`, always chain `.drop_vars('plev')` immediately after. The scalar `plev` coordinate otherwise gets included in the DataFrame MultiIndex, causing the pressure value (e.g. 85000) to be plotted instead of the actual data.

### Maps
- Do not show coastlines (`ax.coastlines()`) in manuscript map figures.
- For **vertical** colorbars (the default for multi-row map figures like E1): use `fraction=0.015`, `pad=0.06`, `aspect=25`.
- For **horizontal** colorbars (used when a single-row ERA5 reference colorbar would cause rotated label overflow — e.g. E2 trend bias maps): use `fraction=0.04`, `pad=0.06`, `aspect=30`. The `pad=0.06` rule applies in both cases. Do not try to switch a figure's colorbar orientation to achieve CLAUDE.md compliance — only fix individual parameter values.
- When a figure shows both a reference field (ERA5) and model error/bias for the same variable, share the colorbar limits **only if the ERA5 values and model errors are similar in magnitude** (e.g. E2 trend bias, E3 ENSO coefficients). Do not share when ERA5 absolute values dominate (e.g. E1, E4) — that would wash out the error signal. When sharing: `shared = max(vlims_ref[var], vlims_error[var])` per variable; do **not** share across different variables.
