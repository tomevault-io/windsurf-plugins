# Marimo Notebook Writing Rules

## File Structure

Every Marimo notebook should begin with a script header block that specifies the Python version and dependencies:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "llamabot[all]==version",
#     "package1==version",
#     "package2==version",
# ]
# ///
```

Following the header, import marimo and configure the app width:

```python
import marimo

__generated_with = "0.13.11"  # Update version as needed
app = marimo.App(
    width="medium",  # or "full" for wider notebooks
)
```

## Cell Organization

The first cell must import marimo and return the mo object:

```python
@app.cell
def _():
    import marimo as mo
    return (mo,)
```

**CRITICAL**: Variable names must be unique across ALL cells in a Marimo notebook. Never reuse variable names (including loop variables) between different cells, as this will cause conflicts. Each variable name can only be defined once across the entire notebook.

Markdown cells (mo.md) serve multiple purposes in your notebook:

* Main title (h1)
* Section headers (h2)
* Subsection headers (h3)
* Explanatory text
* Exercise instructions
* Class discussions
* Summaries

Always use `hide_code=True` for markdown cells:

```python
@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(mo):
    mo.md(
        r"""
        ## Section Title

        Content goes here.
        """
    )
    return
```

Code cells should focus on implementation details:

* Import required packages
* Define classes and functions
* Create bot instances
* Execute bot calls
* Return relevant variables for use in other cells

## Content Organization

Structure your notebook with a clear title and introduction. Break the content into logical sections using h2 headers, and use h3 headers for specific topics. Include exercises after introducing new concepts, and conclude with a summary section.

## Code Style

Maintain high code quality by:

* Using type hints for function parameters and return values
* Documenting classes and functions with docstrings
* Using descriptive variable names
* Keeping cell outputs focused and relevant
* Returning variables that will be used in subsequent cells

## Bot Implementation

When implementing bots:

* Define system prompts clearly and concisely
* Use @lmb.prompt decorator for templated prompts
* Set appropriate temperature values (0.0 for deterministic, higher for creative)
* Document model choices and their implications

## Best Practices

Keep your notebooks maintainable and effective by:

* Focusing each cell on a single concept
* Using markdown for explanations and code for implementation
* Including exercises to reinforce learning
* Documenting assumptions and requirements
* Maintaining consistent formatting
* Implementing proper error handling
* Adding comments for complex logic

## Common Patterns

### Bot Creation

```python
bot = lmb.SimpleBot(
    system_prompt="Clear, specific prompt",
    model_name="model_name",
    temperature=0.0,  # Adjust as needed
)
```

### Markdown Sections

```python
mo.md(
    r"""
    ## Section Title

    Content goes here.
    """
)
```

### Exercises

```python
mo.md(
    r"""
    ### Exercise

    Exercise instructions here.
    """
)
```

## File Naming

Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate the notebook's purpose. For ordered notebooks, use number prefixes (e.g., 01_, 02_). Replace spaces with underscores and always use the .py extension.

## Dependencies

Manage dependencies effectively by:

* Listing all required packages in the script header
* Specifying exact versions for reproducibility
* Including both direct and indirect dependencies
* Updating versions as needed
* Using `llamabot[all]` instead of just `llamabot` to ensure all components are available
* Avoiding separate installation of individual llamabot components

## Documentation

Provide clear and comprehensive documentation by:

* Including clear explanations of concepts
* Documenting code with comments
* Providing relevant examples
* Including references to external resources when appropriate

## Notebooks

When editing Marimo notebook prose, prioritize concise writing while using bullet points strategically to emphasize key points. Always adhere to MarkdownLint rules for consistent formatting.

## MarkdownLint Rules

Follow all MarkdownLint rules for consistent formatting.
Notebooks should also adhere to MarkdownLint rules within `mo.md()` code cell strings.

## Reference Documentation Style

When writing reference documentation (e.g., references.md):

* Use clear hierarchical structure with H1 and H2 headers
* Format bullet points consistently using dashes (-)
* Structure links as `[Title](URL) - Description`
* Provide concise, descriptive summaries after each link
* Group related resources under clear section headers
* Maintain consistent spacing between sections
* Use descriptive section titles that clearly indicate the content category
* Keep descriptions focused and informative, highlighting key aspects of each resource
* Organize content logically by topic or theme
* Ensure all links are valid and properly formatted
