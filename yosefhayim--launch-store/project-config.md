description: Always-on contributing context for the launch-store codebase.

You are working **on** launch-store (the `launch` CLI), not using it. The canonical working rules live in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - read them first.

- One Node ESM / TypeScript package. `src/cli` is thin Commander wiring, `src/core` is purpose-grouped domain code, `src/providers` are swappable backends, `src/apple` and `src/google` are store API mirrors, and `src/testkit` holds shared fakes/layers.
- Do not create flat `src/core/*.ts` files. Put new core work under the owning purpose folder such as `build/`, `config/`, `credentials/`, `release/`, `store/`, `services/`, `terminal/`, or `types/`.
- Before calling a change done, run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm lint:style && pnpm docs:check && pnpm test && pnpm build` (the generated docs + these rules are gated).
- Keep it KISS / YAGNI / DRY: extend the nearest sibling file rather than inventing a new file, util, or abstraction. Add a test (`*.test.ts`) beside any new logic.
- Never log, write, or commit secrets; `~/.launch` holds non-secret paths and ids only.
