description: Editing the domain shapes or provider interfaces.
---


The purpose-named modules under `src/core/types/` are the source of truth for domain shapes and the five provider interfaces (`BuildEngine` / `StorageProvider` / `CredentialsProvider` / `Submitter` / `ComputeHost`).

- Add or change a shape in its matching purpose-named module and import it directly. Do not create an internal barrel.
- Normalized App Store resource/query shapes live in `src/core/types/appleCatalog.ts`; generated Apple wire types stay in `src/apple/generated/schema.ts`.
- Google Play wire/resource DTOs currently live beside the transport in `src/google/playClient.ts` and `src/google/playReporting.ts`; move them into a resource module only as part of that API mirror cleanup.
