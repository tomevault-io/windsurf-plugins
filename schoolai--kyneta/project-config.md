# Repository-wide Rules
We are seeking mathematical rigor, correctness, beauty, and elegance in our design. NEVER support backwards compatibility, or deprecating code. This project is experimental and fluid--always delete old code, always take the elegant path even if it means extra effort and/or refactoring.

If you catch yourself saying, "But this is a bigger refactor" and dismiss an instruction, or "Let me be pragmatic..." and then simplify or ignore part of the plan, re-read the plan. Follow the instructions. Big refactors are ok. Pragmatism does not trump elegance.

If you notice a "pre-existing" problem or error that has nothing to do with the current plan, FIX IT! You are fully responsible for the code health of the entire project. If something was "missed" in the last run, it doesn't matter that it is now pre-existing: it's up to you to bring it up for discussion, build it correctly, or fix it.

Do NOT use non-null assertions (i.e. `!`), even in tests.

# Testing and Verification
Please always verify ALL aspects of the code, not just tests. This is important: the `pnpm verify` script is built to show simple, fast problems first, then cascade to more severe issues. This is intentional--we own the correctness of all aspects of the code, and should immediately fix anything that `verify` shows as failing.
- use `pnpm` as a package manager
- run `pnpm verify` at root to check formatting, linting, and tests across all packages
- run `cd packages/exchange; pnpm verify` to check formatting, linting, and tests in a specific package
