description: Deterministic workflow to find and export full podcast transcripts as cleaned TXT files from YouTube URLs, episode webpages (including Xiaoyuzhou), Apple Podcasts title search, X/Twitter links, direct audio URLs, or plain episode titles. Use when users ask for 逐字稿/文字版/transcript/txt and want minimal trial-and-error.

# Podcast Transcript TXT

## Overview
Produce clean TXT transcript-like outputs for podcast/video episodes with a fixed decision tree.
Prioritize official transcript sources first, then platform subtitles or official page text, then local ASR fallback.
ASR fallback uses `faster-whisper` with selectable `--asr-model small|medium` (default `small`).
All transcript outputs are working drafts; always recommend one strong-LLM proofreading pass.

## Workflow Decision Tree

1. Normalize input.
- Accept one or more `--input` values.
- Support (stable): YouTube URL/ID, episode webpages (including Xiaoyuzhou), direct audio URLs, or plain title.
- X/Twitter status URL: best-effort resolver to outbound sources.

2. Resolve canonical episode source.
- Stable path A: if input is YouTube URL/ID, use it directly.
- Stable path B: if input is direct official transcript URL/JSON, parse it directly.
- Stable path B2: if input is a local official transcript file (`.ttml`, supported `.json`), parse it directly.
- Stable path C: if input is direct audio URL, go to local ASR path.
- Stable path D: if input is episode webpage, attempt transcript parse, then structured page text, then extract `og:audio`/JSON-LD audio as ASR source.
- Stable path E: if input is plain title, resolve with `ytsearch1`, then Scripod `search -> channel -> transcript` resolver, then Apple `podcastEpisode` search fallback.
- Optional path: if input is X/Twitter URL, try outbound link resolution or compact title hint fallback, then follow A-E.

3. Fetch transcript in strict priority order.
- Priority A: official transcript/API source from episode host (including YouTube description outbound links).
- Priority B: platform subtitles via `yt-dlp` (`youtube:player_client=android`).
- Priority C: structured page text from episode webpage when it is clearly visible and substantial.
- Priority D: local ASR fallback when A/B/C unavailable and an audio source is available (`faster-whisper`, `--asr-model small|medium`, default `small`).

4. Error and boundary handling.
- If A/B/C all fail, return exact failed stage and error detail.
- Record every step into `meta.json.attempts[]`.
- Do not bypass login/paywall/DRM protections.

5. Clean and export.
- Remove timestamp markup and HTML tags.
- Collapse rolling-caption duplication.
- Run readability quality checks; if needed, apply aggressive secondary splitting.
- Keep paragraph-level readability.
- Write one TXT file per input item.

6. Post-process (optional — run after step 5 when transcript is ready).
- Trigger: always run this step. Do not wait for the user to ask.
- Input: the transcript from step 5 + `meta.json` (title, description, shownotes, chapters).
- Optionally generate `<same-base-name>.body-cleaned.txt`: remove only pure ads / pure housekeeping / pure subscribe reminders, keep all substantive conversation verbatim, and prefer this file for `*.speaker-draft.txt` when present.
- Extract speaker hints from metadata: episode title, guest name mentions, intro/outro text.
- Re-read the transcript and annotate each paragraph with the most likely speaker.
- Format each turn as `[Name]: text`. If uncertain, use `[?]: text`.
- For ASR-derived transcripts: names and terms may have phonetic errors — cross-reference metadata to correct obvious mismatches before attributing.
- Do not invent speaker names not inferable from the transcript or metadata.
- Output: `<same-base-name>.speaker-draft.txt` alongside the existing `*.txt`. Never overwrite the original transcript.
- Add a one-line header to the speaker-draft file: `# Speaker Draft — inferred, not authoritative. ASR source.`

## Deterministic Rules

1. Do not jump between random methods.
- Always follow A -> B -> C -> D.
- D requires an audio source (direct audio URL / episode webpage audio / Apple episode audio).
- Record the failure reason before moving to next tier.

2. Default security posture.
- Do not use browser cookies unless explicitly required and approved.
- Do not upload private audio/video to third-party transcript sites.

3. Failure reporting contract.
- Return: failed stage, exact error type, and next action already attempted.
- Persist each attempt in `meta.json` (`attempts[]`).
- If blocked after A/B/C, return one minimal user command to unblock.

4. Delivery quality contract.
- Explicitly state that output TXT may be transcript, subtitle-derived text, or visible page text depending on resolver.
- Explicitly recommend one strong-LLM proofreading pass for names/terms/punctuation.
- Keep this notice concise but always present in final user-facing delivery.
- Ask for ASR model (`small` or `medium`) only when the run is likely to hit audio fallback, and explain the tradeoff in one sentence.
- Remind users that delivery includes both `*.txt` and `*.meta.json`.

## Quick Start

Run (recommended stable usage):

```bash
python3 scripts/podcast_transcript_txt.py \
  --input "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1E9IZfvGMA" \
  --input "播客标题关键词" \
  --out-dir "/tmp/transcripts"
```
