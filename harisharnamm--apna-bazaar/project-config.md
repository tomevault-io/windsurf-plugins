General Rule:

When a task requires building or modifying a user interface, you must use the tools available in the shadcn-ui
MCP server.

Planning Rule:

When planning a UI build using shadcn :
1. Discover Assets: First, use list_components() and list_blocks() to see all available assets in the MCP server.

2. Map Request to Assets: Analyze the user's request and map the required UI elements to the available components and blocks.

3. Prioritize Blocks: You should prioritize using blocks ( get_block ) wherever possible for common, complex UI patterns (e.g., login pages, calendars, dashboards). Blocks provide more structure and accelerate development. Use individual components ( get_component ) for smaller, more specific needs.

Implementation Rule:
When implementing the UI:
1. Get a Demo First: Before using a component, you must call the
get_component_democomponent_name() tool. This is critical for understanding how the component is used, its required props, and its structure.

2. Retrieve the Code:
• For a single component, call get_component(component_name) .
• For a composite block, call get_block(block_name) .
3. Implement Correctly: Integrate the retrieved code into the application, customizing it with the necessary props and logic to fulfill the user's request.General Rule:
