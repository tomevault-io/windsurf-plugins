# AI Agent Instructions

This repository is a **community-shared skill library** for AI coding agents. It works with any AI coding tool that supports skills or custom instructions:

- Claude Code (Anthropic)
- OpenAI Codex
- Cursor
- Kilo Code
- GitHub Copilot
- Windsurf
- And any other AI coding assistant

## Repository Purpose

This is a universal, community-driven skill library. Skills are self-contained instruction sets that teach AI agents specific workflows, guidelines, or capabilities. The format is designed to be tool-agnostic and work across different AI platforms.

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:
```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Required: Skill definition with YAML metadata
    references/           # Optional: Reference documentation
    assets/               # Optional: Images, templates
    scripts/              # Optional: Helper scripts
```

### SKILL.md Format

Every skill must have a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what the skill does and when to use it.
author: Your Name or Team (optional but recommended)
---
```

When adding a new skill, always ask for the author name if not provided. The author field is displayed in the README skills table.

## Scanning and Updating Marketplace

When the user asks to "scan and update marketplace" or "update marketplace.json", follow this workflow:

### 1. Scan Skills Folder
Scan all directories in `skills/` that contain a `SKILL.md` file.

### 2. Parse Skill Metadata
For each `SKILL.md`, extract the `name` and `description` from the YAML frontmatter.

### 3. Update marketplace.json
Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
- Keep the existing `name`, `owner`, and `metadata` sections
- Update the `plugins` array based on `plugin-groups.json` so each plugin can contain multiple related skills
- Each plugin requires: `name` (ending with `-skills`), `description`, `source: "./"`, `strict: false`, and a `skills` array
- The `skills` array lists the skill paths for that plugin

Note: Claude Code currently indexes skills from the repo root, so keep `source: "./"` and rely on the explicit `skills` list to scope installs.

### 4. Update README.md
Update the "Available Skills" table in `README.md` to match the current skills.

### 5. Report Changes
Report to the user:
- New skills added
- Skills removed (if any were deleted)
- Any skills with missing or invalid metadata

### Example Update

If a new skill `api-testing` is added to `skills/api-testing/SKILL.md`, update `plugin-groups.json` and add or extend the matching plugin entry:

```json
{
  "name": "awesome-ai-agent-skills",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Ân Vũ",
    "email": "8651688+thienanblog@users.noreply.github.com"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Community-shared skills for AI coding agents",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "documentation-skills",
      "description": "Skills for authoring AI agent instructions and backend documentation.",
      "source": "./",
      "strict": false,
      "skills": [
        "./skills/agents-md-generator",
        "./skills/documentation-guidelines"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "laravel-app-skills",
      "description": "Guidelines for building Laravel 11/12 apps across common stacks and tooling.",
      "source": "./",
      "strict": false,
      "skills": [
        "./skills/laravel-11-12-app-guidelines"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Contributors can group related skills in one plugin (like Anthropic's `document-skills` with xlsx, docx, pptx, pdf). Update `plugin-groups.json` to add multiple skills to the same plugin.

## Current Skills

| Skill                        | Path                                   | Description                                                        |

## GitHub CI Validation

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated validation and syncing:

### On Pull Requests (validate-pr.yml)
- Runs `npm run validate` to check:
  - Each skill folder has a valid `SKILL.md`
  - YAML frontmatter contains required `name` and `description` fields
  - All skills in `skills/` are listed in a plugin's `skills` array
  - Each plugin has `source: "./"` and a valid `skills` array
- If validation fails, a comment is added to the PR with common issues

### On Merge to Main (sync-marketplace.yml)
- Automatically runs `npm run sync` to:
  - Scan all skills in `skills/` folder
  - Update `marketplace.json` based on `plugin-groups.json`
  - Update the skills table in `README.md`
  - Commit and push changes if any
