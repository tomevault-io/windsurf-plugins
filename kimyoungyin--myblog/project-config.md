# Learning Summary Documentation Standards (MANDATORY)

## 📚 **Document Structure (MUST FOLLOW)**

### **1. Header and Overview**

```markdown
# Phase X 학습정리: [Feature Name] 구현

## 개요

[Brief description of what was implemented in this phase, including main features and capabilities]
```

### **2. Core Learning Content Structure**

````markdown
## 핵심 학습 내용

### 1. [Technical Area 1]

#### [Specific Topic]

```sql/typescript/javascript
[Code examples with proper syntax highlighting]
```
````

**학습 포인트:**

- **[Concept]**: [Detailed explanation]
- **[Pattern]**: [Implementation details]
- **[Best Practice]**: [Why this approach was chosen]

````

## 🎯 **Content Requirements (CRITICAL)**

### **Technical Deep Dive Sections**
- **ALWAYS** include code examples with syntax highlighting
- **ALWAYS** explain the "why" behind technical decisions
- **ALWAYS** document problems encountered and solutions
- **NEVER** just list what was done - explain the learning value

### **Decision-Making Documentation**
```markdown
**고민했던 부분과 해결책:**

**문제**: [Clear problem statement]
**해결책**: [Solution with code example]
**학습한 내용:**
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]
````

### **Architecture and Design Patterns**

- Document component hierarchies with tree structures
- Explain state management decisions with comparisons
- Include performance considerations and trade-offs

## 🔄 **Integration with Previous Phases (MANDATORY)**

### **Always Include This Section**

```markdown
## 기존 Phase에서 활용한 기술

### Phase 1-3: 기본 인프라

- **[Technology]**: [How it was used in current phase]

### Phase 4: [Previous Phase Name]

- **[Feature]**: [Integration details]
```

## 🤔 **Decision Analysis Framework (REQUIRED)**

### **Document Major Decisions**

```markdown
## 핵심 의사결정과 그 이유

### 1. [Decision Topic]

**결정**: [What was decided]
**이유**:

- [Reason 1 with technical justification]
- [Reason 2 with user experience consideration]
- [Reason 3 with maintainability aspect]
```

### **Alternative Approaches**

- **ALWAYS** document what alternatives were considered
- **ALWAYS** explain why they were rejected
- **NEVER** present decisions as obvious without justification

## 📊 **Code Examples Standards (CRITICAL)**

### **Before/After Comparisons**

````markdown
**Before (문제점):**

```typescript
// ❌ 문제가 있던 방식
const problematicCode = 'example';
```
````

**After (해결):**

```typescript
// ✅ 개선된 방식
const improvedCode = 'example';
```

````

### **Problem-Solution Pattern**
```markdown
**시도한 방식들:**

1. **[Approach 1] (문제 발생)**
```typescript
// Code example showing the problem
````

2. **[Approach 2] (개선)**

```typescript
// Code example showing improvement
```

3. **[Final Approach] (최종 선택)**

```typescript
// Final solution with explanation
```

````

## 🚀 **Performance and Optimization (REQUIRED)**

### **Document Performance Considerations**
- State management efficiency
- Rendering optimization techniques
- Caching strategies
- Network request optimization
- Bundle size impact

### **Security Considerations**
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention

## 🎨 **User Experience Analysis (MANDATORY)**

### **UX Improvements Documented**
```markdown
### [UX Aspect] 개선

#### **Before**: [Previous state]
#### **After**: [Improved state]
#### **Impact**: [Measurable improvement]
````

### **Accessibility Considerations**

- Semantic HTML usage
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility

## 🔮 **Future Improvements Section (REQUIRED)**

```markdown
## 향후 개선 방향

### 1. [Improvement Area]

- [Specific enhancement 1]
- [Specific enhancement 2]

### 2. [Technical Debt]

- [Identified issue and proposed solution]
```

## 📝 **Writing Style Guidelines (MANDATORY)**

### **Language and Tone**

- **ALWAYS** write in Korean for main content
- **ALWAYS** use technical English terms in code and concepts
- **ALWAYS** explain complex concepts in simple terms
- **NEVER** assume prior knowledge without explanation

### **Code Documentation**

- **ALWAYS** include comments in code examples
- **ALWAYS** use meaningful variable names
- **ALWAYS** show both the problem and solution
- **NEVER** show code without context

### **Structure and Flow**

- **ALWAYS** use numbered sections for major topics
- **ALWAYS** use bullet points for learning points
- **ALWAYS** include visual separators (---) between major sections
- **NEVER** create walls of text without breaking them up

## 🎯 **Conclusion Requirements (CRITICAL)**

### **Must Include Summary**

```markdown
## 결론

[Phase X] [기능명] 구현을 통해 [핵심 학습 내용 요약].

특히 [가장 중요한 기술적 성과]를 통해 [구체적인 개선 사항]을 구현할 수 있었고, [상태 관리/아키텍처 패턴]을 활용한 [결과]로 [복잡한 기능]을 [품질 수준]으로 처리할 수 있게 되었습니다.

이러한 경험은 향후 [미래 적용 가능성]에서도 활용할 수 있는 견고한 기반이 될 것입니다.
```

## 🚫 **FORBIDDEN Practices**

- **NEVER** create learning summaries without code examples
- **NEVER** document features without explaining the learning value
- **NEVER** skip the decision-making rationale
- **NEVER** ignore integration with previous phases
- **NEVER** write generic conclusions without specific insights
- **NEVER** use only English when Korean explanation would be clearer
- **NEVER** create documentation that reads like a changelog

## ✅ **Quality Checklist**
