Code structure expectations:

- `src/agentex/` contains the core SDK and generated API client code
- `src/agentex/lib/` contains manually maintained code that should not be overwritten by the code generator
  - `cli/` Typer-based CLI implementation
  - `core/` Core services, adapters, and Temporal workflows
  - `sdk/` SDK utilities and FastACP implementation
  - `types/` Custom type definitions
  - `utils/` Utility functions
- `examples/` provides example implementations and tutorials
- `tests/` contains the test suites

Key components quick reference:

- Client Layer: HTTP client for AgentEx API in `_client.py` and `resources/`
- CLI Layer: Typer-based commands under `lib/cli/`
- Core Services: Temporal workflows and services under `lib/core/`
- FastACP: Protocol implementation in `lib/sdk/fastacp/`
- State Machine: Workflow state management in `lib/sdk/state_machine/`

Generated vs manual code:

- Treat `src/agentex/lib/**` as manual code; avoid edits in generated areas unless regenerating consistently
- Expect merge conflicts between generator outputs and manual patches; keep custom logic in `lib/`
