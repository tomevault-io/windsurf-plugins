# Agent Instructions

This repository is a local-first Markdown hierarchy app. The bundled `notes/` folder is neutral sample data only. Do not put private or user-specific notes in the app repository.

## Required Frontmatter

Every note must start with this shape:

```yaml
---
title: "Human Readable Title"
parent: null
---
```

Derived depth semantics:

- A note with `parent: null` may be a loose note or the root of an independent hierarchy.
- A note with a parent derives its graph depth from the parent chain.
- Old `level` frontmatter is legacy metadata. The app ignores it and may remove it when rewriting a note.

## Canonical Linking Rule

The `parent` property is the only canonical hierarchy edge when present.

Use `parent: null` for loose notes and roots of independent hierarchies.

For every connected child note, `parent` must point to exactly one immediate parent:

```yaml
parent: "[[parent-note]]"
```

The parent must be the child's immediate parent. Multiple independent hierarchies may live in one folder.

Do not use body links to define hierarchy. Body links are contextual references only.

## File Naming

Preserve existing filenames when editing existing notes.

For new notes, use a stable Markdown filename and a display title:

```yaml
title: "Example Child"
```

The graph displays `title`, not the filename.

Use stable Markdown filenames. Subfolders are allowed, but folder names do not define hierarchy; `parent` does.

## Manifest

When adding or deleting Markdown files, update `notes/manifest.json`.

The local app can read files directly after the user opens the notes folder, but `manifest.json` keeps the seed preview working before folder access is granted.

## Strict Separation

Do not add schema fields beyond `title` and `parent` unless the schema is explicitly changed. The app derives depth and children from each present parent edge.
