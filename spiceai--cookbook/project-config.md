# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **Spice.ai OSS Cookbook** — a collection of self-contained "recipes" demonstrating how to use [Spice.ai](https://spiceai.org) for data and AI applications. Each top-level directory is an independent recipe (e.g., `ai/`, `kafka/`, `postgres/`, `cqrs/`).

## Recipe Structure

Every recipe follows the same pattern:

- `spicepod.yaml` — Spice.ai configuration file defining datasets, models, views, and acceleration settings
- `README.md` — Step-by-step instructions to run the recipe
- Optional: `docker-compose.yml` / `compose.yaml`, `Makefile`, `.env.example`, data files, helper scripts

Recipes are **not interdependent** — each can be run in isolation from its own directory.

## Key Concepts in spicepod.yaml

- **Datasets** (`datasets:`): Data sources with a `from:` URI (e.g., `postgres:`, `s3://`, `file:`, `duckdb:`) and optional `acceleration:` block for local materialization
- **Models** (`models:`): LLM configurations (e.g., `from: openai:gpt-4o-mini`) with API key references via `${secrets:KEY_NAME}`
- **Views** (`views:`): SQL-defined virtual tables
- **Catalogs** (`catalogs:`): Connectors to external catalog systems (Databricks Unity, Iceberg, Glue)
- Secrets are loaded from `.env` files using `${secrets:VAR_NAME}` or `${env:VAR_NAME}` syntax

## Running a Recipe

```bash
# Install Spice CLI
curl https://install.spiceai.org | /bin/bash

# Run any recipe
cd <recipe-dir>
spice run          # starts the Spice runtime (spiced)
spice sql          # opens interactive SQL REPL against the running instance
```

Some recipes require Docker infrastructure — check for `Makefile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `compose.yaml`:

```bash
make              # or docker compose up -d
spice run
```

Spice runtime listens on:

- **50051** — Arrow Flight (primary query protocol)
- **8090** — HTTP API
- **9090** — OpenTelemetry metrics

## CI / Testing

Tests use a reusable GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/codex-test-reusable.yml`) that:

1. Installs the Spice CLI
2. Uses Codex CLI to execute each recipe's README instructions verbatim
3. Parses output for `TEST PASSED` / `TEST FAILED`

To add a new testable recipe:

1. Create `.github/workflows/codex-test-<name>.yml` calling the reusable workflow
2. Register it in `.github/workflows/spice-qa.yml` under the appropriate matrix (`trigger-simple-recipes` for no secrets, `trigger-secrets-recipes` for API-key-dependent recipes)

The `spice-qa.yml` orchestrator runs weekly and can be triggered manually with version and secrets options.

## Shared Data

The `data/` directory contains CSV files (e.g., `taxi_zone_lookup.csv`, `customer_feedback.csv`) referenced by multiple recipes via relative paths like `file:../data/filename.csv`.

## When Adding or Modifying Recipes

- Each recipe must be self-contained with its own `spicepod.yaml` and `README.md`
- READMEs should include exact CLI commands and expected output — they serve as both documentation and test scripts
- Use `.env.example` to document required secrets; actual `.env` files are gitignored
- The `spicepod.yaml` format is `version: v1`, `kind: Spicepod`
- Prefer public datasets (e.g., `s3://spiceai-public-datasets/`) for recipes that don't require external credentials
