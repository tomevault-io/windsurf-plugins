# Privy Integration with Custom Account Abstraction

This project integrates a custom Account Abstraction infrastructure with Privy's embedded wallet solution.

## Integration Guidelines
- Privy is used for wallet creation and management
- ShBundler is used for Account Abstraction and user operations
- Safe account type is used for the smart account implementation
- All user operations are sponsored by a custom paymaster

## Important Details
- The embedded wallet from Privy serves as the base signer for the Safe account
- Smart account client handles UserOperation creation, gas estimation, and submission
- Gas fees are covered by the custom paymaster by default
- EOA signature is generated using Privy's embedded wallet and passed to the Safe account

## Key Components
- `useWalletManager.tsx`: Initializes the Safe account and client
- `useTransactions.tsx`: Handles transaction operations using the smart account client
- The integration follows ERC-4337 specifications for account abstraction
