# DevHub

devhub (developers.databricks.com) is the platform for developers to get all they need to build and deploy data apps and AI agents to Databricks. It provides opinonated guides, tools, and best practices for the Databricks developer stack.

## Contributing

Review the [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more information on how to contribute to DevHub.

## DevHub Development Workflow

For every change to DevHub, do the following:

- run `npm run dev` to start the development server (both Docusaurus and the API functions)
- use the `building-components` skill to understand how to write React components
- make your changes
- run `npm run fmt` to format the code
- run `npm run typecheck` to verify types are correct
- run `npm run verify:images` to verify example/resource images (16:9, ≥1600x900) when you've added or changed anything under `static/img/examples/`
- run `npx fallow dead-code` and `npx fallow dupes` to check for dead code and duplication after your changes (see "Dead Code & Duplication" below)
- use agent-browser to verify the changes
- use the `seo-audit` skill to verify all changes are SEO-friendly
- use the `frontend-design` skill to verify all changes adhere to the design principles
- run `npm run build` to verify build is successful
- run `npm run test` to run smoke tests (builds, serves, verifies sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and llms.txt)

The pre-commit hook (husky) runs `prettier -c .`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run verify:images`, and `npm run build`, so failing any of these locally will also block the commit.

## Package Manager

This repository uses **npm** exclusively. Do not use bun, yarn, or pnpm. All scripts, CI, and documentation assume npm/npx.

## DevHub Coding Guidelines

- Strictly follow the Functional Core, Imperative Shell pattern: separate application logic into two parts: a functional core with pure, side-effect-free functions for business rules and data transformation, and an imperative shell that handles impure actions like database I/O, network requests, or user input, making the core logic easily testable and modular
- Everything is a library: Organize features and domains as self-contained folders in `src/lib/` (e.g., `chat`, `ai`, `db`). Co-locate schema, queries, types, and utilities together. Components go in `components/<feature>/`.
- Use the web platform: Prefer native APIs and standards. Avoid abstractions that hide what the code actually does.

### TypeScript

- Avoid `export default` in favor of `export` whenever possible.
- Only create an abstraction if it's actually needed
- Prefer clear function/variable names over inline comments
- Avoid helper functions when a simple inline expression would suffice
- Don't use emojis
- No barrel index files - just export from the source files instead
- No type.ts files, just inline types or co-locate them with their related code
- Don't unnecessarily add `try`/`catch`
- Don't cast to `any`

### React

- Avoid massive JSX blocks and compose smaller components
- Colocate code that changes together
- Avoid `useEffect` unless absolutely needed

### Tailwind

- Always use Tailwind over CSS Modules
- Avoid `@apply` in favor of inline Tailwind classes
- Use brand colors and avoid raw color values
- Always use shadcn/ui components as the foundation for all UI

## Dead Code & Duplication

After making changes, always run [fallow](https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow) to keep the codebase clean:

```bash
npx fallow dead-code
npx fallow dupes
```

Then reason from first principles before acting on the report — do not blindly delete or merge:

### Dead code (`fallow dead-code`)

For every flagged item, decide between two options:

- **Remove it** if the code is genuinely unreachable, no longer referenced, or was scaffolding that never got wired up.
- **Wire it up** if the code is something the change you just made should actually be using (e.g. you wrote a parallel implementation and forgot the existing helper). In that case, leverage the existing code instead of duplicating it.

Always prefer the simpler outcome: a smaller codebase with no orphaned exports.

### Duplication (`fallow dupes`)

Duplication reports are a hint, not a verdict. For each cluster:

- **Ignore it** when the matches are not _real_ duplicates — e.g. similar shapes that happen to look alike, generated code, fixtures, or two functions that share a structure but model genuinely different concepts. Some repetition is good; premature abstraction is worse than a little copy-paste.
- **Unify it** only when the matches are clearly the same type, the same function, or the same logic expressed twice. In that case, extract a shared helper / type / component and replace the call sites.

When in doubt, leave it alone and write a short note in the PR explaining why the duplication is intentional.

## Browser Automation

Use `agent-browser` for web automation. Run `agent-browser --help` for all commands.

Core workflow:

1. `agent-browser open <url>` - Navigate to page
2. `agent-browser snapshot -i` - Get interactive elements with refs (@e1, @e2)
3. `agent-browser click @e1` / `fill @e2 "text"` - Interact using refs
4. Re-snapshot after page changes
