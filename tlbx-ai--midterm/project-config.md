This terminal runs inside MidTerm (web terminal multiplexer).

If `.midterm/AGENTS.md` exists, follow it for browser control and tmux workflows.
If it does not exist, do not assume extra MidTerm-specific workflow permissions.

## Release Authority

Do not run release, tag, publish, promote, or merge-to-main workflows unless the user explicitly authorizes that exact action in the current turn.

- Midterm is programmed in c# and typescript -> all major data processing/protocol logic/business logic shall be handled in c#, the typescript frontend shall be held as lean as possible.
- Use best practices for maintainable memory efficient code that uses the newest available .net features >= .net 10
- We do not have a big team continuously revisiting code quality, and we cannot afford to come back later to clean up avoidable leftovers. If a feature change or refactor supersedes logic, helpers, types, config, branches, or APIs, remove that dead code in the same change. Do not leave cleanup debt behind on the assumption that someone will revisit it later.
- always search if somthing exist first before implementing new features/api surfaces 
- Midterm is in production, it is used by large teams and needs to be stable and performant 

Rules:

- "Cut a dev/prerelease" does not imply "promote to stable".
- If the user says "patch release", "minor release", or "major release" without specifying stable vs dev, default to a dev/prerelease.
- Only treat it as a stable release when the user explicitly says stable, promote, or otherwise clearly asks for the stable path.
- Dev/prerelease path: use `scripts/release-dev.ps1`.
- Stable release path: use `scripts/release.ps1`.
- Promotion path: use `scripts/promote.ps1` only with explicit approval.
- Never run `scripts/promote.ps1`, create or push release tags, publish release artifacts, or merge release PRs without explicit approval.
- For urgent fixes, implement and verify the change first, then stop before release or promotion unless the user explicitly says to continue.
- For release tasks, the final stop message must end by showing the release contents. Prefer dumping the same changelog entries that were passed to the release script.

## Terminal Design Constraints

- Do not suggest hiding, virtualizing, or lazily deactivating visible terminal sessions as a latency optimization.
- In MidTerm, sessions that are shown are intentionally kept as genuinely active terminals; latency work must preserve that UX model.

## Terminal Size Ownership

- Treat terminal row/column size ownership as a manual, user-controlled decision.
- Do not add automatic ownership handoff heuristics based on reconnects, inactivity, visibility, focus, device class, viewport size, or "last active" guesses.
- If a phone or tablet claimed ownership earlier, that ownership must persist across disconnects and later reconnects until the user explicitly claims ownership from another browser.
- Only the leading browser may send or imply authoritative terminal `cols`/`rows`, including for new sessions, fit actions, panel/layout changes, session switches, and viewport resizes.
- Non-leading browsers may scale locally for presentation, but they must never dictate server-side terminal dimensions.
- When fixing resize bugs, preserve this principle: improve the leading browser's reliability, not the follower's authority.

## Session Surface Boundary

- Treat Terminal and Lens as separate surfaces with an explicit boundary.
- What happens in Terminal stays in Terminal unless the user explicitly launched a Lens session through the Lens-oriented flow.
- Do not infer a Lens session from foreground process metadata alone. Running `codex`, `claude`, or another AI CLI inside a normal terminal must not auto-switch surfaces, surface Lens tabs, or reclassify the session as Lens-owned.
- The IDE bar rule is exclusive, not additive:
  - normal terminal session: `Terminal` + `Files`
  - explicit Codex Lens session: `Codex` + `Files`
  - explicit Claude Lens session: `Claude` + `Files`

## Lens Runtime Principle

- Implement provider-backed Lens sessions as Lens-owned runtimes, not as reinterpretations of terminal transcript output.
- For each explicit Codex or Claude Lens session, MidTerm should launch or attach a dedicated provider runtime for that Lens surface and consume structured runtime events from that runtime.
- Lens is not a terminal transcript view. It must rely on explicit provider APIs and structured protocols that Codex and Claude expose for rich UI clients, with `mtagenthost` as the intended MidTerm host boundary for those integrations.
- Reserve `transcript` terminology for actual terminal/PTTY capture or legacy wire names only. In Lens code and docs, prefer `history` for the canonical provider-backed item sequence and `timeline` for its rendered visual presentation.
- An explicit Lens session does not own or attach to an `mthost` terminal. Its runtime boundary is `mtagenthost`, which launches the provider with the parameters and structured transport needed for a rich web UI integration.
- Do not scrape the terminal buffer, infer assistant turns from PTY text, or depend on foreground process output as the source of truth for Lens conversation state.
