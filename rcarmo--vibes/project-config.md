# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project shape

Vibes is a Go backend with an embedded Bun-built frontend:

- Backend: `cmd/`, `internal/`
- Frontend source: `static/js/`, `static/css/`
- Generated frontend bundle: `static/dist/`
- Frontend build script: `build.js`
- E2E tests: `tests/`

Always treat `static/dist/*` as generated output. Change source files first, then rebuild through the Makefile:

```bash
make frontend
```

## Use the Makefile

Use `make` targets for normal development, validation, builds and serving. Do not run ad-hoc `go`, `bun`, or `node` commands when an equivalent Makefile target exists.

Common targets:

```bash
make frontend      # typecheck converted TS modules + rebuild static/dist/
make lint-frontend # run frontend ESLint
make typecheck-frontend # type-check converted TypeScript frontend modules
make build         # frontend + Go binary
make build-go      # Go binary only, assumes static/dist exists
make test          # Go tests
make lint          # Go vet
make check         # lint + test + coverage
make serve         # build and run
make dev           # run from source for local development
make e2e           # Playwright E2E flow
```

If a workflow needs a raw command that is not represented in `Makefile`, prefer adding or updating a Makefile target first. Use raw `go`, `bun`, or `node` commands only for one-off diagnostics, dependency maintenance, or when explicitly requested, and mention why in your notes.

## Frontend development principles

The frontend should move steadily away from large monolithic files and toward small, typed, capability-oriented modules.

### Modularity

Prefer small files with clear responsibilities over expanding existing large modules.

Recommended structure as the frontend grows:

```text
static/js/
  app.js                 # app wiring only; avoid adding feature logic here
  api/                   # API clients grouped by backend area
  components/            # reusable Preact components
  components/compose/    # compose box subcomponents
  components/timeline/   # timeline subcomponents
  features/              # feature-level modules, e.g. backends, workspace, settings
  hooks/                 # reusable Preact hooks
  lib/                   # pure utilities with no DOM assumptions
  types/                 # shared TS types once TypeScript is introduced
  ui/                    # low-level UI helpers
```

Avoid adding more unrelated logic to:

- `static/js/app.js`
- `static/js/components/compose-box.js`
- `static/js/components/timeline.js`

When modifying those files, prefer extracting cohesive pieces into nearby subfolders.

### CSS organization

`static/css/styles.css` should not keep growing indefinitely. New styles should be grouped by component or feature and progressively split into imports once the build pipeline supports it.

Recommended future structure:

```text
static/css/
  styles.css             # imports/tokens/base shell
  tokens.css             # variables, colour/theme tokens
  base.css               # reset/body/global typography
  layout.css             # app shell/layout primitives
  components/
    compose.css
    timeline.css
    status.css
    settings.css
    workspace.css
  features/
    backends.css
    editor.css
```

CSS component split-outs are wired into `build.js`; prefer adding component-specific rules under `static/css/components/` and updating the `cssSources` list when creating new CSS files. Keep `styles.css` for tokens, base rules, layout primitives and legacy rules pending extraction.

### Progressive TypeScript conversion

Start converting frontend code to TypeScript incrementally rather than as a flag day.

Preferred order:

1. Pure utilities in `static/js/lib/` → `.ts`
2. API clients and payload shapes → `.ts`
3. Backend/provider capability types → `.ts`
4. Small presentational components → `.tsx` or `.ts` depending on the chosen JSX/htm setup
5. Larger stateful components last

Do not convert a large component and mix unrelated refactors in the same change. Keep conversion PRs/commits small and reviewable.

When TypeScript is introduced:

- add a `tsconfig.json`
- enable `checkJs` only if useful during transition
- keep `strict` on for new `.ts` files where practical
- type API responses at module boundaries
- prefer discriminated unions for SSE/backend events
- avoid `any`; use `unknown` and narrow
- keep generated bundle output in `static/dist/`

### API and event typing

Backend/provider work should expose stable JSON shapes and corresponding frontend types.

In particular, keep these typed once TypeScript is available:

- provider descriptors
- provider capabilities
- timeline interactions
- backend provenance metadata
- SSE events
- slash command responses
- queue/follow-up items
- workspace file responses

Capability-driven UI should be represented as data, not scattered boolean guesses.

### Preact component practices

- Keep components focused and shallow.
- Extract derived state into pure helpers.
- Extract repeated effects into hooks.
- Avoid inline logic in large template blocks when it can be named.
- Prefer explicit props over implicit global state.
- Keep DOM-specific code out of pure modules.
