# Quick Dev Notes

## Writing Style

- Add minimal, only necessary information to SKILL.md, design.md, `cli/src/guide/*.md`, or `references/*.md`. The context is precious. Trim them while you add new rules. Don't just pile up.
  - You can assume agents today perform better if you give them short and generic requirement instead of very specific, lengthy rules.
- When writing bullet points, it's recommended to use `- **bold title**: one liner` format to make the requirements scannable.
- Always use a professional and comprehensible language.
- **UI text**: assume that readers have ZERO patience. Use clean UI philosophy. The UI must be extremely intuitive and glanceable. No explanation notes unless actually necessary.

## Answering

- Just answer what I ask, in a minimal language. If you make a mistake, admit and correct it. Don't argue what you already know your're wrong.
- Use ascii diagram if the thing you're explaining is complex.

## System Design

We discourage over-design.

## The public site

`web/design.md` describes how the site in `web/` looks and is put together.

## Pre-commit Checks

- **Python**: `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
- **JavaScript/Typescript**: run in whichever app you touched — `web/` (the public site),
  `kanban-ui/` (the local board UI), `cloud-ui/` (the hosted board at `cloud.ai4kanban.dev`),
  `cli/` (the `akb` command and the board's rules), `cloud/` (the Cloud service) and
  `telemetry/` (the usage endpoint at `t.ai4kanban.dev`) each have their own checks. Don't use
  `pnpm build`.
  - `cd web && pnpm typecheck && pnpm run lint`
  - `cd kanban-ui && npm run typecheck && npm run lint` — npm, never `pnpm install`: the
    desktop app packs this app's `node_modules`, and pnpm's symlinked layout makes a build
    that only runs on your machine.
  - `cd cloud-ui && npm run lint` — its own files only; the screens it draws are
    `kanban-ui/`'s and are linted there.
  - `cd cli && npm run lint` — typechecks `src/`. The rules build to `cli/dist/kanban.mjs`,
    which is a build product and not in git: `npm install` in `cli/` makes it, and there is
    nothing to commit or keep in sync.
  - `cd cloud && npm run lint && npm test`
  - `cd telemetry && npm run lint && npm test`

## The `akb` command in this repo

There is no `akb` on PATH here — `.claude/skills/kanban` is a symlink to `skill/`, so the
skill note gives the general answer. In this checkout `akb` means `node cli/bin/ai4kanban.mjs`.
Use that instead of `npx`, and never install the command globally.

## Long conversation

If the current session is long and all about a plan, when we finalize the plan, write a HANDOFF.md file so we can implement it in a fresh session.

## Code Style

When you see a lengthy comment, trim it down aggressively to key notes for future writers, or just remove it. Code is enough to explain itself. Add comments only when necessary.
