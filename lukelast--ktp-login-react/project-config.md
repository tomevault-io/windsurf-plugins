description: All publishable code lives in `src`, with `src/index.ts` re-exporting modules from `src/lib` and importing the shared `src/styles.css` so bundlers emit our CSS asset. `auth/` houses context logic, `firebase/` wraps SDK helpers, `config/` exposes initialization, and `components/` contains the React pages. Keep library styles at the top of `src/styles.css` (demo-only selectors live at the bottom). Demo scenarios stay in `demo/`, while `dist/` is always generated.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
All publishable code lives in `src`, with `src/index.ts` re-exporting modules from `src/lib` and importing the shared `src/styles.css` so bundlers emit our CSS asset. `auth/` houses context logic, `firebase/` wraps SDK helpers, `config/` exposes initialization, and `components/` contains the React pages. Keep library styles at the top of `src/styles.css` (demo-only selectors live at the bottom). Demo scenarios stay in `demo/`, while `dist/` is always generated.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` starts Vite against the demo so UI changes can be verified interactively.
- `npm run build` runs `vite build` plus `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` to emit `dist/index.js`, `dist/types`, and `dist/ktp-login-react.css` (exposed via the `./styles.css` export).
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint across `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` and should be clean before every PR.
- `npm run test` executes Vitest; add `--runInBand` to chase flaky suites.
- `npm run preview` serves the last build for a production-style sanity check.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Stick to 2-space indentation, TypeScript syntax, and named exports so modules stay tree-shakeable. Components and hooks use PascalCase (`ProtectedRoute`, `useAuth`), while helpers are camelCase and constants are SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. Add or update namespaced `.ktp-*` selectors inside `src/styles.css` (library selectors first, demo selectors last) instead of sprinkling Tailwind utility strings everywhere. Colocate feature-specific utilities, and only touch `dist/` via the build command.

## Styling & Asset Pipeline
`src/styles.css` is our single source of truth for component styling and is imported once in `src/index.ts`; Vite writes it to `dist/ktp-login-react.css`, which is publicly re-exported through `package.json` as `./styles.css`. Keep new UI work using those classes, document any new selectors in the README/demo, and update the export map if additional public assets ever ship.

## Testing Guidelines
Vitest is the required framework. Store specs beside the unit they cover (`src/lib/auth/useAuth.test.tsx`) and mock `../firebase/firebase` when network calls would occur. Each exported hook, provider, and page should have at least a smoke test plus regression cases linked to reported bugs or config edge cases.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent commits use short, imperative subjects such as `add auth code`; follow that style and keep one concern per commit. Pull requests must explain the why, summarize the notable files, list the commands run (`npm run lint && npm run test`), and attach UI screenshots when layouts change. Link tracking issues and tag reviewers who own the affected area (auth, firebase, components) to keep context flowing.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Secrets and tenant-specific endpoints never live in this repo. Pass them to `initializeAuthLibrary` from your host application, and guard new provider buttons the way `LoginPage.tsx` gates each OAuth option. Verify `/auth/login` and `/auth/logout` connectivity whenever changing fetch logic so library consumers avoid authentication outages.
